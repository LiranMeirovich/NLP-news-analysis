Walz recently captured the internets attention and swayed Democrats messaging by succinctly summing up how he views Republicans theyre weird

But its not just the weird of it all hes been able to run through a list of what Democrats want and what hes done as governor during a banner time for Democrats in his state that articulates to voters what they would be voting for  not just the danger of what theyre voting against He speaks plainly and pragmatically showing the commonsense policies his party stands for

Tims just a freaking downhome guy said Tim Ryan a former Democratic US representative from Ohio who worked with Walz

Ryan called to mind a recent clip in which Walz mentioned that Minnesota ranked in the top three for happiest states in the nation Isnt that really the goal here For some joy When he mentioned that I was like dang man thats really good Thats really good because it gets us out of the political space and into the human being space

The UK prime minister Keir Starmer has warned farright thugs that they will regret any role in rioting after violent antiimmigration protests spread through multiple cities in England and in Belfast at the weekend

These clashes were met by even larger counterprotests in many areas with residents in Middlesbrough Sunderland and other locations uniting to help clean up after a trail of destruction

At least 247 related arrests were made at the weekend in England and Northern Ireland The violence is the worst mass disorder since the 2011 riots across England

The farright marches took place after a knife attack in Southport where three girls were killed and 10 people injured after a 17yearold boy attacked a Taylor Swiftthemed dance class

A flood of disinformation about the Southport stabbings has been spread on social media by sources ranging from farright activists to fake news websites and conspiracy theorists leading to a farright attack on a mosque in the town shortly after

Starmer has said a standing army of specialist police officers would be set up to quell the rioting and unrest according to the PA news agency

A senior adviser on extremism to Conservative prime ministers has suggested the Tory government left the UK wide open to farright violence erupting across parts of the country by ignoring red flags and stoking a culture war agenda

The Police Federation of England and Wales said the clashes were flooding across major cities and towns and warned that further violence was likely in the coming days

Its not the first time we are doing this reporting the deaths of colleagues but every time it feels as if its the first time

This is what Hind Khoudary a Palestinian journalist in Gaza working for Al Jazeera said after learning of the death of her colleagues Ismail alGhoul andcamera operator Rami alRifi after an Israeli strike hit their car in northern Gaza

Al Jazeera said Ghoul and Rifi were in the alShati refugee camp reporting from near the house of the Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh who had been killed in an Israeli strike hours earlier

The journalists were wearing press vests and Al Jazeera says their car was clearly marked as a press vehicle Footage from the ground shows a white car completely destroyed

Khoudary described how heartbreaking it was to have to report on the deaths of her AlJazeera colleagues which include the camera operator Samer Abu Daqqa and journalist Hamza Wael Dahdouh who were killed in separate Israeli airstrikes in December and January

Authorities in Gaza say 165 Palestinian journalists have been killed since 7 October

Khoudary also referenced the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank in 2022 A joint investigation by Forensic Architecture and Palestinian human rights organisation AlHaq found evidence that an Israeli sniper repeatedly shot at Akleh and that her killing was deliberate

Israel initially blamed the Al Jazeera reporters death on Palestinian militants but after widespread international outrage later said there was a high possibility she was killed by an Israeli soldier 

The IDF maintains the shooting was accidental and therefore a criminal investigation is not warranted

It came after farright protesters pelted police with glass bottles and bricks and attacked a mosque following a knife attack that killed three children

Thirtynine police officers sustained injuries North West ambulance service said with 27 of them taken to hospital Merseyside police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures lacerations a suspected broken nose and a concussion Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries and one was knocked unconscious

This came after misinformation about the Southport knife attack suspect spread on social media as farright activists and conspiracy theorists shared content

The UKs home secretary Yvette Cooper urged the public to avoid unhelpful speculation about the attack saying social media companies need to take some responsibility for the content being shared on their sites

On a distant reef 16000km from Paris surfer Gabriel Medina has given Olympic viewers one of the most memorable images of the Games yet with an airborne celebration so well poised it looked too good to be true

The Brazilian took off a thundering wave at Teahupoo in Tahiti on Monday emerging from a barrelling section before soaring into the air and appearing to settle on a Pacific cloud pointing to the sky with biblical serenity his movements mirrored precisely by his surfboard

The shot was taken by Agence FrancePresse photographer jeromebrouilletphotography who said the conditions were perfect the waves were taller than we expected He took the photo while aboard a boat nearby capturing the surreal image with such accuracy that at first some suspected Photoshop or AI

So he Medina is at the back of the wave and I cant see him and then he pops up and I took four pictures and one of them was this one said Brouillet It was not hard to take the picture It was more about anticipating the moment and where Gabriel will kick off the wave

But Brouillet had knowledge and experience on his side  he could see one of the best waves of the day was approaching and knew that Medina often does this kind of celebration at the end of the wave

Its very cool its a nice shot and lots of people love it Its not really a surf photograph so it captures the attention of more people

But the book perpetuates a stereotyped representation of Appalachia one in which people like me dont exist writes Neema Avashia who is the daughter of Indian immigrants and was born and raised in southern West Virginia

Back in 2016 I was an Appalachian expat living in Boston feeling homesick and displaced like I do most of the time up here she writes I saw a book in the Harvard Coop with the word Hillbilly on the cover and jumped at it

I barely read 30 pages before I saw the book Hillbilly Elegy for what it was a political platform masquerading as memoir Before I saw JD Vance for what he was an opportunist One willing to double down on stereotypes to paint the people of Appalachia with a culture of poverty brush rather than be honest about the ways in which both electoral politics and industry have failed our region

JD Vance a venture capitalist turned Ohio senator who rose to fame with his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy once described himself as a never Trumper Now the two men are running mates   heres what to you need to know APGettyReuters 2024vote 2024election trump biden vance jdvance uspolitics appalachia ohio
Donald Trump has named JD Vance the Ohio senator and bestselling author of the 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy as his running mate for the 2024 election

When Trump first ran for office Vances eventual nomination to run alongside him would have seemed implausible Vance was once among Trumps conservative critics saying during an October 2016 interview that he was a terrible candidate

He even wondered aloud in texts to a former roommate whether Trump was more of a cynical asshole like Nixon or worse Americas Hitler

Since then Vance has made a dramatic transformation into a Maga power figure and close ally of the former president who has supported some of Trumps more authoritarian impulses like questioning the results of the 2020 election and in a 2021 podcast interview suggesting Trump should purge civil servants from the federal government if reelected

Vance has already vied for Trumps blessing once before while campaigning for a seat representing Ohio in the US Senate During the primary Vance pitched himself as a Trumpstyle rightwing populist

In office Vance has consistently aligned with the populist right calling into question the USs role in foreign conflicts and backing rightwing domestic legislation In 2023 for example he introduced a bill that would make English the official language of the US

The latest Israeli airstrikes add to one of deadliest weeks in the Gaza war and come amid uncertainty over whether Hamas has withdrawn from ceasefire talks

Four attacks in various parts of Gaza City in the early hours of Sunday took place less than 24 hours after Israeli forces said they had targeted Mohammed Deif the alleged mastermind behind the 7 October attack in a strike in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza that reportedly killed more than 90 people and injured 300 others

Another 14 people were killed in a strike on Sunday morning near a UNrun school being used as a shelter for displaced people in Nuseirat central Gaza journalists at the scene said Israel said Hamas militants were present in the area

Sundays bombings add to what was already one of the deadliest weeks of Israeli aerial attacks on Gaza since the war broke out nine months ago

More than 38400 Palestinians have been killed in Israels retaliatory operation in Gaza according to the health ministry in the Hamasadministered territory and the population of 23 million people is in the grips of a devastating humanitarian crisis

There has long been violence in American politics writes Guardian US columnist Moira Donegan

Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords was injured in a mass shooting at a constituent event in Arizona in 2011 President Reagan survived an assassination attempt in 1981 and black Americans have faced violent oppression when attempting to exercise their right to vote

But the assassination attempt of Donald Trump on Saturday at a campaign rally in Butler Pennsylvania which left a spectator and the gunman dead two other critically injured and the former president with a wound to the ear was a grim reminder of the new era of intensified political violence in which we are living

As an increasingly polarised nation reeled from the attack with disinformation and conspiracy theories from left and right alike about the shooting  the motives for which currently remain unknown  sweeping social media Joe Biden on Sunday forcefully condemned political violence and appealed for people to reject extremism and fury

There is no place in America for this kind of violence  for any violence Ever Period No exception the president said We cant allow this violence to be normalised

Law enforcement agents were investigating what they suspected was an attempt to assassinate Donald Trump after a man with a rifle fired shots at him during a campaign rally on Saturday in Butler county Pennsylvania

The Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Gugliemi said on X that the former president was safe following several shots which prompted agents protecting Trump to leap on him amid the ensuing panic 

Gugliemi said Secret Service agents then fatally shot the suspected attacker  who had fired toward Trump from an elevated position outside of the rally venue Gugliemi said

One spectator was killed and two others were critically wounded The shooter was not immediately identified

In a pair of statements Trump said he was fine after a bullet struck the upper part of his right ear

The former president also issued thanks to the Secret Service agents as well as other law enforcement officers for their rapid response in a Truth Social post in the shootings aftermath

Mostly importantly I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed and also to the family of those badly injured said Trump who was taken to a hospital for evaluation and then reportedly released about 1020pm local time

It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country

Every day nearly 2000 children under five are dying from air pollution  meaning it has overtaken poor sanitation and a lack of clean water to become the second biggest health risk factor for youngsters around the world

More than 8 million deaths of children and adults were caused by air pollution in 2021 according to a new study from the Health Effects Institute HEI as both outdoor and indoor pollution continue to take an increasing toll on health

Dirty air is now the second biggest killer globally overtaking tobacco use and second only to high blood pressure as a risk factor for death among the general population Among children under five air pollution is second only to malnutrition as a risk factor in mortality

This years State of Global Air report published in June and produced this year in partnership with Unicef also shows that children in poor countries are suffering some of the worst impacts with the death rate linked to air pollution in children under five 100 times higher in most of Africa than it is in high income countries

At the beginning of a new parliament all MPs are required to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch before taking their seats in the House of Commons If they do not they cannot sit or vote in the chamber or receive their salary

On Wednesday as the process of swearing in all 650 MPs began the Labour MP Clive Lewis said he was declaring his allegiance to the king under protest adding I take this oath under protest and in the hope that one day my fellow citizens will democratically decide to live in a republic

The Scottish National party MP Seamus Logan who is the new representative for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East said he was reading the oath under protest

The Social Democratic and Labour party leader Colum Eastwood who is the returning MP for Foyle in Northern Ireland said I read out this empty formula in order to represent my constituents but its under protest  My true allegiance is to the people of Derry and to the people of Ireland

Eastwood is one of two SDLP MPs in parliament His colleague Claire Hanna also protested saying first in Gaelic then in English In friendship and hope of a reconciled new Ireland I affirm my allegiance to the people of South Belfast  Mid Down and read the words required to serve them

MPs for the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fin have always refused to take their seats in Westminster  partly as they refused to swear allegiance to the monarchy and because they do not recognise the authority of the British government over Northern Ireland

Do you think the UK needs to change its voting system

After a historic set of results in last weeks election this is the new landscape of British politics

Smaller parties achieved record vote shares while independent candidates broke through in many places and the Liberal Democrats regained their status as the third largest party

But while the colours look definitive the unbalanced relationship between the number of seats won by the parties versus their share of the total vote paints a different picture  and has led some to call for a change to the way the voting system works

The 2024 election was one of the most disproportionate results in recent history according to Darren Hughes the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society

The UK uses a firstpastthepost system which tends to exaggerate the representation of larger parties in parliament in order to create majorities and often leaves smaller parties clutching on to a handful of seats relative to their vote share

While Labour won 63 of seats from only 338 of the vote Reform took 143 of the popular vote  making it the third biggest party by vote share  but won only five seats

In contrast the Lib Dems won a record 72 seats despite a vote share of about 12 The Green party received 68 of the vote for its four seats

We have already had a growing chorus of calls for PR proportional representation in the aftermath said Hughes which allows voters to vote for candidates in order of preference

Some experts argue that PR has produced more social democratic politics in Wales and Scotland However others say it could be a pathway for extremist politics as has happened in some places in Europe

Tonight social justice won Tonight environmental justice won Tonight the people won And its only just started said Frances Green leader Marine Tondelier as thousands took to the streets of Paris to celebrate a surprise leftwing surge that blocked the farright National Rally RN and its allies from their anticipated success in the French elections

In contrast there was stunned silence at the farright National Rally RN party headquarters as the results of Frances legislative elections came in

The leftist alliance unexpectedly took the top spot in the elections ahead of the farright in a major upset that bars Marine Le Pens National Rally from getting enough seats to form a government

The New Popular Front alliance  which includes the former ruling Socialist party PS France Unbowed Greens and Communists  secured 182 seats in the 577seat parliament President Emmanuel Macrons centrist alliance also performed better than expected with 163 seats while the RN and their allies came short of their poll leads with only 143 seats to come in third

Leftist party leader JeanLuc Mlenchon has called on Macron to step down or choose a new prime minister from the winning leftwing alliance

Macrons protege Gabriel Attal announced that he would offer his resignation as prime minister this morning

What exactly is a supermajority And why has it been brought up in British politics so much lately

While the term doesnt actually apply in the UK really  its an American expression referring to a majority in the US Congress big enough to withstand a filibuster a device used by a smaller group of senators to block legislation  it was has been used repeatedly by the Conservatives and Reform UK throughout the six weeks of the general election campaigning

Googles goal of reducing its climate footprint is in jeopardy as it relies on more and more energyhungry data centers to power its new artificial intelligence products

The tech giant revealed Tuesday that its greenhouse gas emissions have climbed 48 over the past five years

Google said electricity consumption by data centers and supply chain emissions were the primary cause of the increase It also revealed in its annual environmental report that its emissions in 2023 had risen 13 compared with the previous year

Data centers play a crucial role in training and operating the models that underpin AI models like Googles Gemini and OpenAIs GPT4 which powers the ChatGPT chatbot

The tech company which has invested substantially in AI said its extremely ambitious goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2030 wont be easy Pledges to reduce CO2 emissions are now coming up against pledges to invest heavily in AI products that require considerable amounts of energy for training and deployment

The International Energy Agency estimates that data centers total electricity consumption could double from 2022 levels to approximately the entire country of Japans electricity demand in 2026

Behind these numbers there are people  people who in the last nine months have been moved around like pawns in a board game said Andrea De Domenico head of the UNs Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA in the Palestinian territories

He said on Wednesday that about 19 million people are thought to be displaced in Gaza

We estimate that nine in every 10 people in the Gaza Strip have been internally displaced at least once if not up to 10 times unfortunately since October Domenico told reporters

He said that the strip had been cut in two by Israels military operations with the UN agency estimating that there were between 300000 and 350000 people living in the north of the besieged territory who were unable to go to the south

The bloodiest Gaza war to date broke out after Hamass 7 October attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1195 people last year mostly civilians according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures

The militants also seized 251 hostages 116 of whom remain in Gaza including 42 whom the army say are dead

Israels retaliatory offensive since then has killed at least 37953 people also mostly civilians according to data from the health ministry in the Hamasrun territory

Fresh strikes carried out by Israel on Khan Younis on Tuesday after it ordered a mass evacuation of much of the city spurred the UN secretary general Antnio Guterres to say no place is safe in Gaza for Palestinian civilians

Recordbreaking sea temperatures  about 2F to 36F 1C to 2C  above normal  driven by the humancaused climate crisis have facilitated Beryls explosive growth and may be a harbinger of even more potential threats to come according to experts

Its a terrible time for smallisland developing states and vulnerable countries said the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines Ralph Gonsalve on Monday with wind howling in the background

He called out rich countries for climate failures saying that for the major emitters of greenhouse gases those who contribute most to global warming you are getting a lot of talking but you are not seeing a lot of action

The US supreme court has ruled that former presidents are entitled to some degree of immunity from criminal prosecution dramatically reducing the likelihood that the federal criminal case against Donald Trump on charges he plotted to stop the transfer of power will proceed before the 2024 election

The courts conservative majority  which Trump helped create  found that presidents were protected from prosecution for official actions that extended to the outer perimeter of his office but could face charges for conduct undertaken in a personal or private manner

Trump is accused of overseeing a sprawling effort to subvert the 2020 election including two counts of conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election results conspiring to defraud the government and conspiring to disenfranchise voters

Among the accusations Trump spread false claims of election fraud plotted to recruit fake slates of electors pressured US justice department officials to open sham investigations into election fraud and pressured his vicepresident Mike Pence to obstruct Congresss certification of Joe Bidens win

The ruling in Trumps election subversion case was one of the last handed down by the supreme court this term In waiting until the end the conservative majority played into Trumps benefit and legal strategy of trying to delay any trial as much as possible

This is the welcome visitors receive at Terminal 1 a new area at this years Glastonbury festival run by artists who are all migrants and which gives attendees a taste of what it feels like to sample British border hospitality

Emblazoned with the old sign from Heathrows Terminal 1 the new area attracted a long queue on Saturday morning as dozens of festivalgoers waited their turn to be grilled

Terminal 1s message is No one is illegal That is our message  to remind us that we are all humans we are all migrants one way or another says Miguel Hernando Torres Umba the performance director He said he wanted people to come away with an experience of what immigration was like for the majority of people around the globe

I think were in a very privileged place said Hernando Torres Umba I think sometimes whats important is to understand though is that some people dont have those privileges

And I think its very important to look at immigration directly as it is a shared responsibility with the world

The theme of immigration can be found across Glastonbury this year

Banksys latest Glastonbury stunt  sending out an inflatable dinghy with dummies representing child migrants during Idles headlining set  ensured the issue of immigration was beamed out live on the BBC

The topic has been one of the overarching themes of the upcoming general election whether through Rishi Sunaks pledge to stop the boats Keir Starmer and Labours plan to establish a command centre to deter those trying to enter across the Channel or Reforms promise of net zero migration

DialledIns cofounder dhruvacurly says I think theres been an attitude shift over the last five to six years but this signifies that it has culminated to a point where South Asian people are not only just given a space but an opportunity to showcase the breadth of what South Asia means to us 

Its not just having an artist from one region of South Asia its having Nepalese Bengali Afghani Mauritian Indian Pakistani Tamil artists all together on one line up on one space building together

shankhoc  who designed Arrivals alongside 4resh and shirin added Whats amazing about particularly the British South Asian Diaspora experience is that we have built our identity often in the absence of sort of role models in the arts because weve been kind of systematically kept outside of those spaces And as our community matures and comes of age were building that power

After Bidens calamitous showing in Thursdays presidential debate with Donald Trump Democrats are panicking and openly talking about who could possibly replace him as the partys nominee

Anything can happen but replacing a candidate at this stage also presents a long and unprecedented road There is no formal mechanism that could replace Biden as the presumptive nominee and such a move would be the first time a US political party has attempted to do so in modern times

In effect the only option would be for Biden to agree to step aside and allow the delegates he won in the primaries  who vote to nominate a candidate at Augusts Democratic National Convention in Chicago  to choose someone else

There is no legal requirement for delegates to vote for the person who won in the primaries but they are asked to vote in a way that in all good conscience reflects the sentiments of those who elected them

So far Biden has also resisted calls to abandon his reelection effort and step aside for a younger candidate

Trump is only three years younger but is a creature of television When Biden spoke the former president hair hovering above his head like a shiny cloud could be seen frowning pursing his lips or revving up for a reply

It had survived conflict before Press House in the upscale neighbourhood of Rimal Gaza was founded in 2013 with the vision of being a politically independent incubator for Palestinian journalism

A year after its creation in the back garden their team planted 17 olive trees in memory of reporters killed during an escalation of violence

But now those trees are buried under rubble and the building like much of northern Gaza is destroyed

As for their network of journalists who were trained and supported by the nonprofit founded by journalist Bilal Jadallah nearly a dozen are amongst the 108 media workers who have lost their lives since Israels invasion of Gaza  recorded by the Committee to Protect Journalists which describes this war as the deadliest period for media workers since it began collating its figures three decades ago

Eight months on from Hamas deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 Oct in which 1200 Israelis died a reported 37000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive Foreign media is banned by Israel and Egypt from entering Gaza to cover the war

Instead Palestinian reporters such as those trained by Press House  including journalists like Plestia Alaqad  have been the only journalists reporting from the ground

A spokesperson for the IDF claims that the narrative that the IDF is intentionally targeting journalists is utterly unfounded and fundamentally false and that civilians who are harmed including journalists harmed during the conflict are a terrible tragedy

For more than a decade Julian Assange has been hidden away  for seven years he was confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London refusing to come out in case he was arrested  until he was finally removed and detained in Belmarsh prison In a small cell for 23 hours a day he faced charges that had he been extradited and convicted would carry a sentence of up to 170 years in a US prison But now finally and suddenly he is being freed

A plea deal with the US Justice department has reduced his 18 charges to one  carrying a sentence of five years And the time he has spent in jail allows him to be freed by the court immediately Finally he can see his family in his home country of Australia

But many see the deal as a dangerous one for journalists

This is now an allout scandal at the heart of Rishi Sunaks Conservative party

This is how Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper described the recent revelations that five people with links to Rishi Sunak or the Conservative party are being investigated by the gambling watchdog for bets placed on the date of the general election before the date was announced

If youre in a privileged position close to the prime minister at the heart of a political operation and you use inside information to make additional money for yourself thats just not acceptable  the levelling up housing and communities secretary Michael Gove told the Sunday Times

A Guardian analysis shows that a sudden flood of bets on a July election was placed on Tuesday 21 May on the Betfair Exchange before Sunak had even told his own cabinet of senior politicians that the early election was going ahead

Between January and May an average of 27 a day was gambled on Sunak calling a general election in July and most people bet just a few pounds on what was seen as an unlikely outcome

Then the day before Sunaks announcement a total of 3285 was gambled on Betfair in dozens of bets Some punters stuck on hundreds of pounds suggesting serious confidence and driving the odds down

Although the data came from only one specialist online bookmaker it immediately suggested the scale of bets across the whole industry may have been more substantial  as the Gambling Commissions own inquiries appear to be bearing out

If the chinampas disappear it is just a reflection of this general mindset in societies this western belief that nature or spaces are at the service of human beings and nothing more I cant imagine a world where there arent chinampas but thats why Im here  to ensure that doesnt happen says Mixtli Barrera Fernndez whose family has a farm in the chinampas Mexicos floating gardens

Springs once filled the chinampas with water that was clean enough for people to drink straight from the canals The community still holds rituals and celebrations in these sacred lagoons which at one time were accessible only on special occasions to preserve the water quality and protect wildlife They are now visited by increasing numbers of tourist boats and kayakers on sunrise tours

Others in Mixtlis community have opened the first chinampa school offering courses in agroecology culture and history cuisine and sciencebacked traditional medicine It is hoped that students will learn not just to be farmers but to become chinamperos and future guardians of La Chinampera

Thousands of demonstrators including bankers teachers and truckers had peacefully converged around Congress throughout the day banging drums and chanting Our country is not for sale 

Police in Buenos Aires later used water cannon and teargas as some protesters hurled sticks stones and molotov cocktails at officers and overturned cars

After 11 hours of heated debate senators voted 37 to 36 in favour of the bill late on Wednesday Lawmakers must now hold an articlebyarticle vote set to last through the night If the Senate approves the bills with modifications the lower house still has to approve them before Milei can officially pass his first law since taking office in December

The fiery rightwing economist was elected on promises he would resolve Argentinas worst economic crisis in two decades

But his political party holds just a tiny minority of seats in Congress and he has struggled to strike deals with the opposition

I dont want to completely say drinking is terrible says Annie Davies 25 who shares her alcoholfree life on TikTok But personally I think everyone would benefit from just assessing their relationship with alcohol

annievdavies says she started drinking when 13  the reality for many people in England which has some of the highest rates of alcohol consumption among school children according to a recent study of over 40 countries by the World Health Organization

The survey found more than half of 13yearolds have drunk alcohol in England as have a third of all 11yearolds

Davies says that as she got older drinking became a massive part of her identity and how she had fun But she also started to realise the impact it was having on her mental and physical health

It got to the point that when I was hungover I was anxious for days Davies says I would get shortness of breath chest pains and I just thought that was normal It sounds so weird now to think that was normal

In the beginning she says she blocked out her fears with UK drinking culture and how immersed we all are in it I was kind of like  what do I do without drinking

Children women are terrified but unfortunately they dont have anywhere to go said journalist Hind Khoudary after an Israeli strike hit a UN school in central Gaza

Israel bombed a UN school which was sheltering displaced Palestinians in the early hours of Thursday morning killing at least 30 people including five children hospital authorities said

The Israeli military said the airstrike targeted terrorists who took part in the 7 October attacks and were planning imminent attacks on troops in the area

The airstrike came as Israel escalated its military operations in central Gaza and soon after another strike on a home in Deir alBalah killed at least six people

Israels military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36000 people according to health officials in the territory who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble The war was sparked by an attack by Hamas in southern Israel in October last year killing about 1200 people

Israel has blocked the entry of much aid and fuel to Gaza and cut off most of the water supply

Israels prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has meanwhile threatened an extremely powerful response to attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanon which have escalated in recent days and set off huge fires in northern Israel

The first TV debate of the UK election campaign turned out to be a fiery matchup Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer tore into each others election promises on tax healthcare and immigration

The pair exchanged barbs in an illtempered session in front of an ITV studio audience in Salford
As the party leaders tried to draw dividing lines between the parties Starmer hammered the Conservative record after 14 years in government and accused Sunak of failing to take personal responsibility for his failures including the cost of living and NHS waiting times
When asked if they would use private healthcare if a loved one was on a long waiting list for an operation Sunak said yes while Starmer said he would not and would rely on the national health service alone

During the hour of intense debate Sunak sought to present Starmer as an unreliable politician who was pursuing power for powers sake 

He claimed repeatedly that Labours policies would lead to a 2000 tax rise for families an attack the Tories are planning to deploy repeatedly over this campaign but has come under heavy scrutiny and is very unproven and most likely incorrect according to our political correspondents

Narendra Modis ruling Bharatiya Janata party has lost its parliamentary majority dealing an unexpected blow to the Indian prime minister

With all votes counted early on Wednesday morning it was clear that the landslide for the BJP predicted in polls had not materialised and instead there had been a pushback against the strongman PM who has now had to negotiate with coalition partners in order to return to power

The party lost 62 seats bringing its total down to 240 below the 272 required for a parliamentary majority

It is the first time since Modi was elected in 2014 that the BJP has not won a clear majority on its own Nonetheless together with its political allies known as the national democratic alliance NDA its win amounts to about 292 seats which is enough to form a majority government to rule for the next five years and return Modi to office for a third term

Despite the tight race Modi insisted he had been given a mandate to lead again in a victory speech Addressing voters at the BJP headquarters in Delhi Modi said he was very very happy today

Our opponents despite being united could not even win as many seats as BJP won he added

Meanwhile the opposition alliance which goes by the acronym INDIA far outperformed expectations collectively winning more than 230 seats The alliance formed of more than 20 national and regional opposition parties had come together for the first time in this election with the aim of defeating Modi

Analysts said results indicated that the Modi wave had been dented by problems such as high unemployment and inflation In the aftermath of the election Modi will probably have to grapple with a more powerful and more animated opposition than at any point over the past decade

That was Barry Glendennings verdict on the Champions League final on Saturday night as Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 20 at Wembley stadium to secure a historic 15th Champions League title for the Spanish champions

Goals from Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Junior in the second half sealed the win but it was a very different story in the first half 

Real Madrid didnt register a single shot on target and Borussia Dortmund missed clear cut chance after clear cut chance which culminated with Karim Adeyemi rounding Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois but unable to put the ball in the back of the net

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has now won the Champions League two times more than any other manager and will surely go down as one of the greatest club managers of recent history

Donald Trump has been found guilty of using a criminal hushmoney scheme to influence the outcome of the 2016 election He was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records

The verdict came after a jury deliberated for less than twelve hours in the unprecedented first criminal trial against a US president 

It marks a perilous political moment for Trump the presumptive nominee for the Republican nomination whose poll numbers have remained unchanged throughout the trial but could tank at any moment

Trump was convicted by a jury of 12 New Yorkers of felony falsification of business records which makes it a crime for a person to make or cause false entries in records with the intent to commit a second crime

In Trumps case the Manhattan district attorneys office alleged Trump falsely recorded the reimbursements he made to his former lawyer Michael Cohen who paid the adult film star Stormy Daniels 130000 for her silence about her affair with Trump as legal expenses

The prosecution alleged the falsifications were made to conceal Trumps violation of New York state election law which makes it a crime to promote the election of any person to office through unlawful means

They looted on a grand scale and they burned shelled and razed neighbourhoods to the ground

A Human Rights Watch HRW report has detailed gruesome testimony from witnesses who describe children being piled up and shot by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces RSF in Darfurs regional capital of El Geneina last summer during a bout of ethnic violence in which thousands of civilians were killed

Together the 221 witness statements collated by HRW in a report published earlier this month offer further evidence that the Arabled RSF has orchestrated a concerted 12month campaign of ethnic cleansing against Sudans nonArab Masalit tribe in West Darfur

Since fighting erupted between the paramilitary RSF and Sudans army in April 2023 more than 8 million people have fled their homes amid a humanitarian crisis that the UN has described as one of the largest in decades

Israeli tanks conducted a second day of probing attacks across Rafah on Wednesday after Washington said an assault on Sunday did not amount to a major ground incursion of the city in the south of Gaza which US officials had told Israel to avoid

According to the news agency Israeli tanks advanced to the heart of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday after a night of heavy bombardment defying an appeal from the international court of justice to end its attack on the city one of the last places of refuge in Gaza

Growing international outrage over the Israeli push into Rafah and Sundays attack in which at least 45 people were killed by an airstrike and huge fire in an area crowded with refugee tents have not had any apparent impact on Israels military plans

The prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the civilian deaths as a tragic mistake but vowed to continue the operation Later a spokesperson for the IDF said its airstrike had not caused the fire

About 1 million Palestinians have fled Rafah since early May but hundreds of thousands are still sheltering there Unrwa the UN agency for Palestinian refugees said yesterday

They left with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments lack of food and water piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions Unrwa said in a post on X Day after day providing assistance and protection becomes nearly impossible

The former head of the Mossad Israels foreign intelligence agency allegedly threatened a chief prosecutor of the international criminal court ICC to abandon a war crimes investigation the Guardian can reveal

Yossi Cohens covert contacts with the ICCs then prosecutor Fatou Bensouda took place in the years leading up to her decision to open a formal investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in occupied Palestinian territories

That investigation launched in 2021 culminated last week when Bensoudas successor Karim Khan announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the countrys conduct in its war in Gaza

Cohen was one of Netanyahus closest allies at the time and personally led the Mossads involvement in an almost decadelong campaign by the country to undermine the court

An Israeli source briefed on the operation against Bensouda said the Mossads objective was to compromise the prosecutor or enlist her as someone who would cooperate with Israels demands

Four sources confirmed that Bensouda had briefed a small group of senior ICC officials about Cohens attempts to sway her amid concerns about the increasingly persistent and threatening nature of his behaviour

According to accounts shared with ICC officials he is alleged to have told her You should help us and let us take care of you You dont want to be getting into things that could compromise your security or that of your family

We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state said Mohammed Abuassa who rushed to the scene after an Israeli airstrike on Rafah in southern Gaza hit tents housing displaced people on Sunday

We pulled out children who were in pieces We pulled out young and elderly people The fire in the camp was unreal Abuassa told the Associated Press

At least 45 people were killed in the attack Palestinian medics said with images of charred and dismembered children prompting an outcry from world leaders

The strike on the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel alSultan occurred days after the international court of justice ICJ ordered Israel to cease its operations in Rafah immediately

More than 85 of the Palestinian territorys population had sought shelter in Rafah having fled fighting elsewhere and a million people have been forced to move again since Israels ground operation there began on 6 May

Israel has been continuing to pound the city with airstrikes and tank fire pressing its offensive despite international condemnation Airstrikes on Rafah overnight killed at least 16 Palestinians first responders said on Tuesday as several Israeli tanks reached the centre of Rafah witnesses told Reuters

Addressing parliament the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted that something unfortunately went tragically wrong despite what he claimed were our best efforts not to hurt them He added I will keep fighting until the flag of victory is raised I dont intend to end the war before every goal has been achieved

The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court has said he is seeking arrest warrants for senior Hamas and Israeli officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity including the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defence minister Yoav Gallant

The ICC prosecutors office also said on Monday it had requested arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar the Hamas chief in the Gaza Strip Mohammed Deif the commander of its military wing considered to be the masterminds of the 7 October assault and Ismail Haniyeh the leader of the groups political bureau who is based in Qatar

Those who do not comply with the law should not complain later when my office takes action based on solid evidence said prosecutor Karim Khan

Today we underline in the clearest possible fashion that international law and the laws of armed conflict apply to everyone No foot soldier no commander no civilian leader  no one  can act with impunity he added

Senior figures in the Israeli government have reacted angrily to the announcement Israels foreign minister Israel Katz said the move was scandalous and tantamount to attacking the victims of 7 October

Israel is also facing a South African case in the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide The ICJ only hears cases between states so it has no jurisdiction over Hamas

Khan the British ICC prosecutor must request the warrants for the Hamas and Israeli suspects from a pretrial panel of three judges who take on average two months to consider the evidence and determine if the proceedings can move forward

The hardline Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi has died in a helicopter crash in foggy weather in the mountains near the border with Azerbaijan

The charred wreckage of the helicopter which crashed on Sunday carrying Raisi as well as the foreign minister Hossein AmirAbdollahian and six other passengers and crew was found early on Monday after an overnight search in blizzard conditions

Fears had been growing for Raisi a 63yearold ultraconservative after contact was lost with the aircraft on Sunday as it navigated fogcovered mountains in northwest Iran Iranian state media blamed bad weather for the crash and said it was complicating rescue efforts

The countrys supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Irans nuclear programme  said the countrys first vicepresident Mohammad Mokhber would take over as interim president Under Irans constitution a new presidential election must be held within 50 days

Raisi was a hardliner who formerly led the countrys judiciary He was viewed as a protege of Khamenei and some analysts had suggested that he could replace the 85yearold leader

He won Irans 2021 presidential election for which the turnout was the lowest in the Islamic Republics history Raisi was under sanctions by the US in part over his involvement in the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 at the end of the bloody IranIraq war

The first thing Marc Conway did after being one of the people who chased and held down the London Bridge terrorist attacker in 2019 wasnt to call his mum or his girlfriend to let them know he was safe  it was to call his probation officer

He says this was because he was terrified that his actions to protect the public could land him back in prison

Conway an exoffender who now campaigns for fairness and justice in prison is one of a few thousand people in the UK who live under an IPP  imprisonment for public protection otherwise known as an indeterminate sentence

IPPs were introduced in 2005 and last year a UN torture expert expressed concerns that the sentences had the potential to be inhuman and degrading 90 out of the 8000 people initially sentenced to IPPs have taken their own lives

Although IPPs were abolished in 2012  after the European court of human rights ruled they were arbitrary and unlawful  they were not abolished retrospectively meaning thousands are still serving these sentences

And while IPP prisoners are automatically referred to the Parole Board to have their licences considered for termination after 10 years of being released  with a bill being debated in the House of Lords to reduce this to three  they can remain on licence for 99 years

More than half of the 2796 people on IPP sentences have been recalled many over minor breaches of their licences rather than for committing new crimes

My anxiety is through the roof says Conway who says his health has suffered from being under an IPP sentence I have seriously high blood pressure Im on the strongest medication you can get for that And Ive been on tablets for depression since Ive been out which Id never been before

What will it mean to him to have his licence terminated I think my blood pressure will instantly drop

Before the war Free Gaza Circus provided training workshops aimed at spreading the art and culture of the circus but the Free Gaza Circuss centre has now been destroyed in Israeli airstrikes and most of its staff have been displaced

Despite this they continue to perform and hold activities in refugee camps in Rafah where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by war have been sheltering

We are seeing patients who have been burned from the skin right down to the bone says Dr Omar ElTaji a British surgeon in one of Gazas largest remaining hospitals as Israels invasion of Rafah deepens

Officials estimate that as many as 500000 people have fled Rafah since being told to evacuate by the IDF before their first attacks in and around the city a week ago while continuing airstrikes and hospitals being forced to evacuate have already strained medical facilities in the south of the Gaza Strip

ElTaji a urology specialist at Health Education North West has been in Gaza for more than a week with medical nonprofit fajrscientificus working out of the European Hospital in Rafah which was founded by UNRWA with a grant from the EU Tens of thousands of refugees are sheltering at the hospital as well as ElTaji after Rafah was evacuated He and his team were due to fly out on Monday but have been unable to leave since the border closed

There with dwindling resources and fewer local staff remaining medical staff have been working day and night to support patients  from babies to the elderly  who have been rushed to the hospital with devastating injuries

These people have gone through this for six to seven months now They cannot go through this any more says ElTaji Please let this war stop

Only a third of Gazas 36 hospitals and primary health care centres are working and all face acute shortages of basic medical supplies fuel and manpower The World Health Organization WHO has warned that southern Gazas medical operations could soon run out of fuel

Israels military offensive in the Gaza Strip triggered by surprise attacks launched by Hamas on 7 October in which 1200 people mostly civilians were killed and about 250 hostages were taken has killed at least 35173 Palestinians and wounded 79061

The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far rejected US pressure to hold off on a fullscale attack of Rafah and claimed the area is the last stronghold of Hamas and that Israel can only achieve its war aims by killing militants and leaders in the city

In September 2022 Kharkiv province was the site of the greatest Ukrainian victory of the war so far the lightning counteroffensive that liberated at least 12000 square kilometres from Russian control pushed Moscows artillery out of range of Kharkiv city and provided real hope that Vladimir Putin could not just be slowed down but defeated

Over the past few days however Kharkiv has been the location of a very different shift This time it is the Russians who have made larger daily advances than at almost any other point in the war and are now moving further forwards

Civilians who had come home are fleeing once more in their thousands and even Kyiv admits that the situation is difficult Further attacks could draw sparse Ukrainian resources from along the frontline deal a heavy blow to Ukrainian morale and redraw the map before the resources belatedly provided by the US last month are in place to do anything about it

Israel has made it through to the final of the Eurovision song contest setting the stage for a tense and politically charged event in Malm on Saturday amid protests and boycotts over the Israeli military in Gaza

Thousands of protesters gathered in Malms central square Stortorget about 7km 43 miles from the competition venue to protest against Israels participation in the competition

ProPalestinian protesters have accused the European Broadcasting Union EBU of double standards It disqualified Russia from Eurovision in 2022 saying the countrys inclusion would bring the competition into disrepute

The EBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete saying Eurovision is a nonpolitical music event and not a contest between governments

Israel was allowed to compete this year after it agreed to modify the lyrics of its entry a ballad widely understood to be a reference to the Hamas massacre on 7 October which was was barred by the EBU for breaking rules on political neutrality

Protests also continued inside the contest this week as the Israeli singer Eden Golan was booed by members of the audience during dress rehearsals on Wednesday Israels prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu later released a statement praising the singer for successfully facing a wave of antisemitism while standing and representing the state of Israel with respect

The Swedish semifinal performer Eric Saade whose father is a Palestinian from Lebanon wore a keffiyeh around his wrist while performing his 2011 Eurovision entry Popular on Tuesday The EBU later said he had compromised the nonpolitical nature of the event

Im relieved that I do not have children knowing what the future holds

Climate researchers have for decades dedicated themselves to painting a picture of the possible worlds ahead Even in 1988 the United Nations was concerned that global heating could be disastrous for mankind if timely steps are not taken at all levels so it convened thousands of experts in all fields to sit on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC

Their task was to produce comprehensive reports reviews and recommendations which it has now done six times over 35 years In terms of scale and significance it may be the most important scientific endeavour in human history

These experts are in short the most informed people on the planet on climate

What they think matters

So the Guardian contacted every available lead author or review editor of all IPCC reports since 2018 Almost half replied  380 out of 843 a very high response rate

The scientists responses to the survey provide informed opinions on critical questions for the future of humanity How hot will the world get and what will that look like Why is the world failing to act with anything remotely like the urgency needed Is it in fact game over or must we fight on 

They also provide a rare glimpse into what it is like to live with this knowledge every day

These men are casually rapping about child sex abuse domestic abuse and harboring secret children that theyve presumably known about for years but only chose to reveal when they were fighting writes Bero

These sisters knew what their rights were and it enraged the kingdom which wants women to be quiet sit in their place and celebrate the crumbs they are given says Bissan Fakih Amnesty Internationals campaigner on Saudi Arabia about the Otaibi sisters

Despite the image of progress they are trying to project internationally their fate is indicative of how Saudi Arabia really treats women who dare to ask for their freedoms she continues

Fakih is referring to the fate of Fawzia Maryam and Manahel alOtaibi popular womens rights advocates in Saudi Arabia who have been outspoken about ending male guardianship rules and giving women the right to travel and work freely

Manahel was secretly sentenced to 11 years in prison by an antiterrorism court after being arrested for her choice of clothing and support for womens rights

Among other charges she was accused by Saudi authorities of using a hashtag that translates as societyisready to call for an end to male guardianship rules

Fawzia was accused of similar offences but was able to flee Saudi Arabia before she could be arrested

Saudi officials confirmed in a statement to the UN last week that Manahel had been sentenced for what the Saudi government called terrorist offences

Fawzia has now moved to the UK to live in Edinburgh It is a city Manahel has always wanted to live in but has never visited Fawzia says She read about it in so many books about the friendly people the scenery and the history

Fawzia says international pressure could help to get Manahel released because Saudi Arabia really cares about what people from outside the country say She says the regime is fearful about this and is using her family to put pressure on her not to speak out saying her sisters would be punished for it

Footage shows massive destruction in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul after heavy rains devastated the region

Storms have affected almost twothirds of the states 497 municipalities with at least 75 people known to have died over 100 people still missing and more than 80000 had been displaced in the flooding according to the states civil defence authority

This part of South America is no stranger to major rainfall Rio Grande do Sul has experienced flooding three other times in the past year

This is because the polar and tropical regions of the atmosphere meet around this latitude resulting in a zone of high pressure that delivers long periods of dry weather punctuated with heavy bursts of rain

However this event has been particularly devastating with experts attributing the heightened rainfall to the combination of global heating and the recent El Nio phenomenon during which waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer

Im living in a country where lots of people see me as an enemy of the state says Can Dndar  one of six journalists who have been exiled from their countries that we spoke to to mark World Press Freedom day on Friday

According to an annual index published by Reporters Without Borders RSF this week political attacks on press freedom including the detention of journalists suppression of independent media outlets and widespread dissemination of misinformation have significantly intensified in the past year

The World Press Freedom Index ranks 180 countries on the ability of journalists to work and report freely and independently

In a year when more than half the worlds population will go to the polls in democratic elections the RSFs index shows an overall decline in press freedom globally and a steep rise in the political repression of journalists and independent media outlets

Threats from the state have led many journalists across the world to flee their home countries to report from elsewhere But for many the intimidation did not stop when they left

The government has a moral duty to look after these people said one protester as hundreds of demonstrators blocked the road near a hotel in south London in a successful attempt to stop asylum seekers who were staying there from being collected and moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge

At least eight asylum seekers living at a Best Western in Peckham were told a week ago that they would be collected on Thursday morning and relocated to the Bibby Stockholm moored at Portland in Dorset

The coach was expected to collect other passengers along the way but it was blocked by protesters after pulling in at a bus stop at about 8am

The people due to be removed were said to include teenagers attending colleges in the area A number of men staying at the hotel said they feared the conditions that would await them on the Bibby Stockholm where an Albanian man Leonard Farruku died last year in a suspected suicide

One said We are also concerned this is happening at the same time as the governments Rwanda plans have gone through But its encouraging to see this sort of support

Fortyfive people were arrested for offences including obstruction of the highway obstructing police and assault on officers according to the Met

A Home Office spokesperson said This behaviour is intimidatory and aggressive As part of our commitment to significantly reduce the use of hotels asylum seekers are being moved into alternative accommodation to reduce costs on the taxpayer

We have returned 150 hotels to local communities and we work closely with accommodation providers to manage the exit process in a way which limits the impact on local authorities and asylum seekers

Im here because my music my dancing my acting the way my body moves in front of the camera and the way my voice resonates through a microphone is not by chance FKA twigs said to a US Senate Judiciary subcommittee

On Tuesday the singer told Congress that AI can be used as a creative and commercial tool  but said  that without regulation it could exploit creators as third parties can take musicians art and identity without consent

The use of AI to impersonate the voices and images of wellknown singers and rappers has been growing

In early April a group of more than 200 highprofile musicians including Billie Eilish Stevie Wonder and Nicki Minaj signed an open letter calling for protections against the predatory use of artificial intelligence that mimics human artists likenesses voices and sound

FKA twigs also told the senate that shes using AI to create a deepfake version of herself to interact with fans and journalists so she can focus on her music Watch the video to hear twigs explanation for why AI use in this way can be a meaningful tool for artists

While international attention has been turned toward Gaza violence against Palestinians has increased in the West Bank too Israeli settler attacks have become more frequent

Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi visualized this rising violence

For decades Israeli settlers have violently stolen Palestinian land with impunity but in recent months their attacks have increased Mona said

The Israeli military often supports these attacks the Israeli police rarely prosecute them and the United States rarely condemns them

Settlers are Israeli citizens who live on Palestinian land In most cases this happens because Palestinians are prevented from accessing their land and are physically attacked by settlers In a third of cases Palestinian property is damaged by settlers

Settlers attacked us destroying our homes water tanks solar panels and cars Abu Khaled 43 told the UN after being displaced on 28 October

I felt the presence of death so tangibly as if I saw it with my own eyes  I made the hardest decision in my life to leave Zanuta and leave everything behind as memories I did this to protect my children

The numbers collected by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA are incomplete The organization notes that cases of harassment trespass and intimidation are not included in these statistics when they do not result in damage or casualties although they too increase the pressure on Palestinians to leave

When discussing the government policy of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda the Conservative MP for Croydon South responded to an audience members question during the BBC One programme by asking Rwanda is a different country of Congo isnt it

The audience member who said he came from the DRC where there is fighting with neighbouring Rwanda asked Had my family members come from Goma a city on the countrys border on a Channel crossing right now would they then be sent back to the country they are supposedly warring  Rwanda

We as American Jews will not be used we will not be complicit and we will not be silent Judaism is a beautiful thousandsyearold tradition and Israel is a 76yearold colonial apartheid state Morgan Bassichis an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace told the crowd

Hundreds of Jewish antiwar demonstrators have been arrested during a Passover seder a ceremonial meal that takes place at the start of the Jewish holiday that doubled as a protest in New York

They shut down a major thoroughfare to pray for a ceasefire and urge th Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer to end US military aid to Israel

The 300 or so arrests took place on Tuesday night at Grand Army Plaza on the doorstep of Schumers Brooklyn residence where thousands of mostly Jewish New Yorkers gathered for the seder a ritual that marked the second night of the holiday celebrated as a festival of freedom by Jews worldwide

The seder came just before the US Senate resoundingly passed a military package that includes 26bn for Israel

This is the Passover that we take our exodus from Zionism Not in our name Let Gaza live Bassichis said

Speakers included journalist and author Naomi Klein Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour and several Jewish students suspended from Columbia University and Barnard College over the protests that have rocked US campuses in recent days

Naomi Klein wrote a piece for the Guardian yesterday Zionism is a false idol that has taken the idea of the promised land and turned it into a deed of sale for a militaristic ethnostate she writes

Zionism is a false idol that takes our most profound biblical stories of justice and emancipation from slavery  the story of Passover itself  and turns them into brutalist weapons of colonial land theft roadmaps for ethnic cleansing and genocide

Clouds of dust blown in from the Sahara covered Athens and other Greek cities on Tuesday one of the worst such episodes to hit the country since 2018 officials said

A yelloworange haze smothered several regions after days of strong winds from the south limiting visibility and prompting warnings from the authorities of breathing risks

Authorities warned that the dust concentrations can reduce sunlight and visibility while increasing concentrations of fine pollution particles posing risks for people with underlying health problems

Greece had already been struck by Sahara dust clouds in late March and early April which also smothered parts of Switzerland and southern France

The Sahara releases 60 to 200m tonnes of mineral dust a year While the largest particles come rapidly back down to earth the smallest can travel thousands of kilometres potentially reaching all of Europe

Five people including a child have died in an attempt to cross the Channel the morning after Rishi Sunaks government passed legislation to allow it to deport asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats to Rwanda

The government wants us to see them all as illegal migrants To dehumanise them so they are not seen as men women children fathers mothers brothers and sisters said Enver Solomon chief executive of Refugee Council reacting to the news of the vote

The Rwanda bill passed after the government overrode the supreme courts unanimous judgment that the Rwanda policy is unlawful and with new legislation making it significantly harder to bring successful individual challenges

Sunak said the first flights removing asylum seekers to Rwanda were planned to depart in 10 to 12 weeks and pledged multiple flights a month through the summer and beyond

But leaked documents suggest that in the first year the government intends to send as few as 500 people to Kigali and that accommodation that was to be used has now apparently been sold off

The deal will cost 18m for each of the first 300 deportees the National Audit Office has said

Solomon said The government still expects us to believe that as soon as a flight does take off  a magical deterrent effect will immediately kick in and the boats will stop coming Yet the evidence from organisations working with refugees and researchers all points in the opposite direction

They should be treated with dignity respect and humanity their asylum claims processed fairly in a timely fashion on UK soil Solomon added

Both sides are playing with fire Peter Beaumont a senior Guardian international reporter writes in a piece on where Iran and Israels relationship is heading after the recent attacks

On Friday US officials confirmed that Israel had carried out strikes against Iran Explosions were reported in the sky over the city of Isfahan and air defence systems were activated elsewhere in the country

The Iranian government sought to play down the scale of the attack andan Iranian official indicated that it had no immediate plan for retaliation

The attack came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials on 1 April

Since those Iranian strikes which were largely intercepted Israel has been weighing its response amid strong pressure from the US and other western supporters to avoid a further dangerous escalation

While Fridays attack is far from the first time that Israel has sought to hit Iran and Iranian interests this time it has occurred in the midst of a period of intensive scrutiny Swipe to read Peters analysis on the situation  and for our latest reporting on this story click the link in bio

Imagine if we could replace the plastic packaging we see in shops and thats delivered to our homes with a sustainable compostable alternative

Couple Julia Marsh and Matt Mayes founded swaythefuture to try and do just that using seaweed

Plastic comes from petroleum so everyday when you open up your snack wrapper or you receive your Amazon order its coming packaged in plastic which comes from fossil fuels says Marsh

Using lots of different types of farmed seaweed Sway have created a plastic pellet which is designed to fit into current manufacturing systems where plastic is used They have also developed a clear plastic film which can be used to replace very common parts of packaging that are the least likely to be recycled

Its not hard for brands to switch to our material because it works in the systems they already use says Marsh

Marsh who is a designer by trade says she spent years designing packaging and making beautiful trash something which didnt match up with her love of the ocean

She looked at many of the existing plastic alternatives and saw shortcomings which hindered them from working in the mainstream

I think replacements for plastic should go even further I think they should do good she says

Here Marsh explains exactly how they make seaweed plastic how this plastic replacement can benefit the oceans and environment and if you can eat it

Global heating has pushed the worlds coral reefs to a fourth planetwide mass bleaching event that is on track to be the most extensive on record US government scientists have confirmed

Some 54 of ocean waters containing coral reefs have experienced heat stress high enough to cause bleaching the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Coral Reef Watch said

Coral reefs are rich in biodiversity and provide habitat to a quarter of all marine species while covering less than 1 of ocean area Reefs provide food and tourism income to millions of people and protect coastlines but are considered to be one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to global heating

Scientists are trying to save the worlds coral and a recent study found that underwater speakers that broadcast the hustle and bustle of thriving coral could bring life back to more damaged and degraded reefs that are in danger of becoming ocean graveyards

We just found ourselves in the middle of a fire Everyone ran back people were screaming and crying

This is how Maha Hussaini described her experience trying to return to the north of the Gaza Strip with her family

Worried about the possible arrival of Israeli forces in the south and tired of living in overcrowded shelters many displaced Palestinians have tried to head north in recent days after rumours of civilians managing to pass through IDF checkpoints

But witnesses describe coming under strikes and sniper fire as they attempted to make the journey

When we reached the north of Nuseirat the last point before Gaza City intense Israeli bombardments began said Hussaini a human rights activist with the organisation EuroMed

The IDF has not commented on these reports and has warned people against travelling into what they say is an active war zone

Despite intense opposition from its closest allies Israel has said for weeks it will launch a ground operation into the border town of Rafah the last corner of the territory that has not seen fierce ground fighting and where nearly 2 million people are sheltering

Police have airlifted a person to safety in Oman where severe flooding has left at least 18 people dead and caused disruptions across other parts of the Gulf region

Heavy rain also affected the United Arab Emirates flooding major highways and disrupting flights at Dubai International airport At least one person was killed after being swept away in his car in Ras Al Khaimah

The rain began on Monday night and by Tuesday evening Dubai had recorded more than 142mm of rain about as much as it expects in a year and a half

Ahmed Habib a specialist meteorologist has said the heightened rainfall in the UAE may be attributed to the practice of cloud seeding in which governmentoperated small aircraft release salt flares into clouds to try to enhance precipitation levels

The UAE started cloudseeding operations in 2002 to address water security issues but the lack of drainage in many areas can trigger flooding

Humancaused climate breakdown is also contributing to extreme weather across the world driving more frequent and more deadly disasters

Crowds gathered outside the church after the incident and were moved on after police officers were attacked

The circumstances of the incident  the particular church that was targeted the nature of the service the bishop in question the spread of videos of the attack and aftermath and the existing tensions between the Assyrian Christian and Muslim communities in the area  were an almost perfectly combustible combination

The NSW premier Chris Minns gathered leaders of the local Muslim Assyrian and Melkite communities for an emergency meeting at 1030pm on Monday organising for them to put their names to a statement condemning the violence and calling for calm

Stop the world for Gaza read one sign on San Franciscos Golden Gate Bridge as thousands of people held demonstrations across the US on Monday calling for a ceasefire in the war

The protests were among many demonstrations held around the world since Israels assault on the Palestinian territory began last year

After the 7 October attacks on Israel carried out by Hamas fighters who killed more than a thousand people and took hundreds of hostages the Israeli government has launched an unrelenting attack on the heavily populated Gaza Strip killing more than 33000 people many of them women and children

Despite worldwide calls for a ceasefire and an order from the UNs top court the international court of justice to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide Israel has yet to pull back

The Israel Defense Forces has continued its military operations and humanitarian aid has been prevented from reaching Gaza where Palestinians remain at risk of famine and an almost totally destroyed healthcare infrastructure

The UN says of the 36 hospitals in Gaza only a dozen are partially functional while the others are ruined

Its now been over a year since Sudan descended into war as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly

The conflict has plunged Sudan into one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history according to UN officials who also warn it may trigger the worlds largest hunger crisis

The conflict in Sudan has also created the worlds worst displacement crisis scattering more than 8 million people internally and across Sudans borders Nearly 2 million people have fled into neighbouring countries to escape the fighting putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan

Even before the fighting broke out the UN estimated more than 3 million women and girls in Sudan were at risk of genderbased violence Since the conflict there have been numerous reports of armed forces using rape as a weapon

Despite that the war in Sudan has received minimal attention in the worlds media

Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik writes The forgotten war is what its called now when its referenced in the international media

Little is offered by way of explanation for why it is forgotten despite the sharpness of the humanitarian situation the security risk of the war spreading and the fact that it has drawn in selfinterested mischievous players such as the United Arab Emirates which is supporting the RSF and therefore extending the duration of the war

One of the reasons for this is Gaza and the escalating Middle East conflict and how they have monopolised global attention and diplomatic bandwidth for the past six months And another is that for those reporting within Sudan and the few who manage to get in doing so is difficult and fraught with danger limiting the output of images and details that can be broadcast consistently to galvanise attention

But the rest I suspect is down to what to most will seem unremarkable this is just another African country succumbing to intractable conflict

Today marks a first in American history a former US president is going on trial for criminal charges

Donald Trump has entered the courtroom as the first president  current or former  to face a criminal trial with jury selection beginning Monday in the Manhattan supreme court

The proceedings also play out against a presidential race in which Trump is the almost certain Republican nominee who regularly bests Joe Biden in headtohead polls

The criminal case against Trump stems from an alleged scheme to cover up purported liaisons with adult film star Stormy Daniels and the Playboy model Karen McDougal ahead of the 2016 general election

Prosecutors say that Trump who was indicted in spring 2023 on 34 counts of falsifying business records participated in an alleged catchandkill scheme through his then lawyer Michael Cohen They said that he did so out of concern that the alleged extramarital encounters with Daniels and McDougal could harm Trumps candidacy

After Trump won the election he paid Cohen back with a series of monthly checks

On Monday Trump walked into the courtroom behind his defense attorney Todd Blanche licked his lips and continued with a hunched posture and what appeared to be a scowl

For the first time Iran has launched a direct attack against Israel from its own soil  and the Middle East stands closer to an allout regional war than at any point since 7 October

The largescale attack by Iran on Israel may have passed with relatively little damage but it marks a significant transformation in the conflict between the two enemies write Guardian international reporters Peter Beaumont and Emma GrahamHarrison

A war that has long been fought through proxies assassinations and strikes away from Israeli soil  often in third countries  has spilled into the open

As world leaders and the United Nations secretary general Antnio Guterres urged restraint Tehran has claimed that it now views the exchange prompted by an Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus as over

The European parliament has passed sweeping changes to the EUs migration laws in a move that supporters hailed as historic but NGOs said was a step backwards for human rights

Devised after Europes 2015 migration crisis in which 13 million people  mostly Syrian refugees  crossed into the bloc the pact will establish border centres to hold people while asylum requests are vetted and speed up any deportations

In the name of European solidarity it requires EU member states to either take in thousands of asylum seekers from frontline states such as Italy and Greece or provide money or other resources to the most underpressure nations

Particularly controversial measures include sending asylum seekers to countries outside the EU that are deemed safe if a person has some ties to that country and taking facial images and fingerprints from children as young as six

Protesters chanting this pact kills vote no interrupted the proceedings and further demonstrations took place outside the parliament building in Brussels

More than 160 rights organisations including Amnesty International Human Rights Watch and the International Rescue Committee denounced the deal arguing it would lead to greater suffering less protection and more rights violations

Julie Burkharts abortion clinic in Wyoming has been set on fire and has protesters outside every week

wellspringhealthaccess is the only abortion clinic in Wyoming one of more than a dozen US states that tried to abortion as soon as Roe v Wade was overturned in June 2022

Burkhart decided it was more important than ever to provide abortion care in the state One month before opening in May 2022 the clinic was set on fire by an antiabortion protester which set her back by 11 months

This was not the first backlash Burkhart has experienced for her work She spent many years working for Dr George Tiller one of only a few people who provided later termination of pregnancy in the US His clinic had been blockaded bombed and flooded before he was killed by an antiabortion extremist in 2009

After his death Burkhart bought the clinic from Tillers widow and reopened it where it still stands today in Wichita Kansas

Her clinic in Wyoming is able to exist because Burkhart and other abortion rights supporters have been fighting through the courts to keep abortion legal and the ban was blocked by a judge pending a trial

Here Burkhart explains why she does the work she does and what its been like opening her clinic in Wyoming

On a scale of one to 10 how scared of rejection are you

The soulcrushing embarrassment of being rejected by a stranger is something most of us would want to avoid  but our reporter Joe Stone spent a month embracing it as part of rejection therapy

Rejection therapy began as a card game challenging players to inoculate themselves against the fear of rejection by placing themselves directly in its path and has since risen in popularity on social media

It has some similarities to exposure therapy  the practice of subjecting a patient to increasing quantities of a thing they fear until they become desensitised  but lacks its clinical basis says Dr Becky Spelman a counselling psychologist and clinical director of Private Therapy Clinic

Israels siege of Gaza has created what aid officials are referring to as manmade starvation with the territory facing the threat of mass deaths from famine in the coming weeks

Gaza has been under military assault by Israel since Hamass attack on 7 October in which the militant group killed 1200 people and seized over 250 hostages An estimated 32000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict  but aid agencies fear that thousands more will die in the coming hunger crisis

The entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity or worse  with many of those in catastrophic need  warned the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC a coalition of UN agencies and aid groups in a recent report

This is the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger ever recorded by the IPC said UN secretary general Antnio Guterres last week

Aid agencies have accused Israel of deliberately blocking food and aid going into the strip while the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees Unrwa said on Sunday that Israel had definitively barred it from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza which faces imminent famine

Israel says that it allows extensive aid to enter and blamed the UN for not delivering aid quickly enough holding up relief efforts and Hamas for stealing supplies

Here from this crossing we see the heartbreak and heartlessness of it all said Guterres visiting Rafah earlier this week A long line of blocked relief trucks on one side of the gates the long shadow of starvation on the other That is more than tragic It is a moral outrage

The Baltimore fire department said it was searching for at least seven people believed to be in the water after reports that a large vessel had crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge

A video posted on X appeared to show the vessel striking one of the bridges central supports causing much of the 26km bridge to give way as a number of vehicles fell into the Patapsco River below The ship appeared to catch fire as part of the bridge appeared to collapse over it sending plumes of thick black smoke into the air

Calls to 911 had come in at about 130am reporting a vessel travelling outbound from Baltimore that had struck a column on the bridge causing it to collapse said Kevin Cartwright the director of communications for the Baltimore fire department Several vehicles were on the bridge at the time including one the size of a tractortrailer

The Baltimore mayor Brandon M Scott and the county executive Johnny Olszewski Jr said emergency personnel were at the scene and rescue efforts were under way

Built in 1977 the bridge spans the Patapsco River a vital artery that along with the Port of Baltimore is a hub for shipping on the USs east coast It is named for the author of the American national anthem The StarSpangled Banner

Only seven countries are meeting an international air quality standard with deadly air pollution worsening in places due to a rebound in economic activity and the toxic impact of wildfire smoke a new report has found

Of 134 countries and regions surveyed in the report only seven  Australia Estonia Finland Grenada Iceland Mauritius and New Zealand  are meeting a World Health Organization WHO guideline limit for tiny airborne particles expelled by cars trucks and industrial processes

When inhaled these particles PM25 can cause a myriad of health problems and deaths

The most polluted country Pakistan has PM25 levels more than 14 times higher than the WHO standard the IQAir report found with India Tajikistan and Burkina Faso the next most polluted countries

Canada long considered as having some of the cleanest air in the western world became the worst for PM25 last year due to record wildfires that ravaged the country sending toxic spoke spewing across the country and into the US

Unfortunately things have gone backwards said Glory Dolphin Hammes North America chief executive of IQAir The science is pretty clear about the impacts of air pollution and yet we are so accustomed to having a background level of pollution thats too high to be healthy We are not making adjustments fast enough

The Princess of Wales has disclosed that she has been diagnosed with cancer and is in the early stages of receiving chemotherapy treatment

In a statement recorded at Windsor by the BBC Catherine said her condition had been discovered after she had major abdominal surgery in January

After weeks of speculation about her health Catherine said she and her husband Prince William had needed time to explain the situation to their three children George 10 Charlotte eight and Louis five

This of course came as a huge shock and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family she said As you can imagine this has taken time It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment But most importantly it has taken us time to explain everything to George Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them and to reassure them that I am going to be OK

The Princess of Wales 42 had been admitted to the London Clinic on 16 January for major abdominal surgery At the time the palace refused to confirm what Catherine was being treated for but said the condition was noncancerous

Catherine said it was only after the surgery that the cancer had been found The king is also currently being treated for cancer

Have you ever wondered how the internet travels around the world

You might think it travels above our heads through the ether but actually 99 of it is carried undersea by fibre optic cables according to TeleGeography

The problem is undersea cables are relatively fragile and can be damaged quite easily especially when theres a conflict happening above them

Experts are worried that the conflict in the Red Sea could damage the worlds internet infrastructure  either accidentally or on purpose

Yemeni Houthi rebels have been attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea since last November in response to Israels bombardment of Gaza  which began after an unprecedented Hamas attack on 7 October

The Red Sea has a series of cables running through its relatively shallow water  and the cables have been described as no thicker than a hosepipe

In the video our technology editor Alex Hern explains all the ways the recent conflict in the Red Sea could threaten our global access to the internet

When Arizona state senator Eva Burch learned that her pregnancy was not progressing and decided to have an abortion Burch and her husband quickly made another decision Burch was going to speak up about it  from the floor of the state senate

On Monday as her voice shook and a group of women surrounded her Burch a Democratic senator gave a 10minutelong speech about her decision and the struggle to navigate Arizonas coercive maze of abortion restrictions

My medical provider was forced to tell me multiple things that dont apply to my situation and some that are just transparently factually false said Burch describing how she was given disinformation about abortion alternatives after seeking an abortion for her pregnancy which is no longer viable

With her speech Burch joined the ranks of women who have spoken out since the fall of Roe v Wade about their battles to get abortions even for nonviable pregnancies

Yet Burch who was still pregnant when she spoke on the floor is believed to be the first pregnant state lawmaker to go into such detail about her plans to get an abortion since Roe v Wades demise

Reports from the ground suggested queues suddenly formed at numerous polling stations across Russias big cities as well as in Europe as the clock struck midday

The protest action labelled Noon against Putin was proposed by the St Petersburg politician Maxim Reznik and endorsed by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny before his death in an Arctic prison He called it a safe way for Russians inside and outside the country to congregate publicly and show their opposition to the president

On Friday Russian prosecutors threatened any voters who took part in the action with five years in prison while the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said protesters could face treason sentences of 20 years for destroying voting ballots

No country in the world affords women the same opportunities as men in the workforce according to a new report from the World Bank which found the global gender gap was far wider than previously thought

For the first time the bank investigated the impact of childcare and safety policies on womens participation in the labor market in 190 countries It found that when these two factors were taken into account women on average enjoyed just 64 of the legal protections men do down from the previous estimate of 77

Report author Tea Trumbic said childcare and safety issues particularly affected womens ability to work Violence could physically prevent them from going to work and childcare costs could make it prohibitive

The 10th edition of the women business and the law report published on Monday also for the first time assessed the gap between laws and the policies put in place to implement them It found countries had on average established less than 40 of the systems needed for full implementation

All over the world discriminatory laws and practices prevent women from working or starting businesses on an equal footing with men said Indermit Gill chief economist of the World Bank Group

Closing this gap could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20  essentially doubling the global growth rate over the next decade  but reforms have slowed to a crawl

Ibrahimas whole journey has been suffering on top of suffering

Since arriving in the UK Ibrahima Bah has had little opportunity to speak to people because he has been behind bars

In 2022 while still a teenager Bah was forced to steer a dangerous and overcrowded dinghy across the Channel from France to the UK At least four people drowned during the crossing Bah told the police the boat journey was terrifying and had taken four days and four nights

He was held responsible for those deaths in a UK court sentenced to nine years and six months in prison His conviction of multiple counts of manslaughter last month was made possible by recent changes in the UK law  part of the Conservative governments clampdown on small boats

But others think he is a victim

The right to claim asylum was enshrined in the 1951 Geneva conventions after the horrors of the second world war  and has saved many lives The UK is still signed up to that convention but UK law now makes it almost impossible to exercise that essential right

The Humans for Rights Network and Refugee Legal Support two of the organisations supporting Bah says his conviction demonstrates a violent escalation in the prosecution of people for the way in which they arrive in the UK

Ibrahima navigated a horrific journey to the UK in the hope of finding safety here through the only means available to him and yet he has been punished for the deaths of others seeking the same thing sanctuary

Survivors of the boat disaster said if it hadnt been for Ibrahima everyone would have drowned They called him an angel who tried to save lives and put the welfare of others first

In his sentencing remarks at Canterbury crown court the judge said to Bah This is also a tragedy for you Your dream of starting a new life in the UK is in tatters

More than 31000 people in Gaza have been killed in the Israeli offensive launched after the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel according to health authorities in Gaza who say most of those killed have been women and children

Israel blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll saying the militant organisation which has run Gaza since 2007 uses civilians as human shields Hamas denies the charge

Looming over all those trying to celebrate Ramadan in Rafah is the prospect of an imminent attack Israeli officials say Hamas leaders are based in the city along with four battalions of militants  the only major remaining fighting force of the Islamist organisation

Though Benjamin Netanyahu Israels prime minister pledged last week to continue to seek total victory he is under intense international pressure to halt Israels military operations and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza

The United Nations secretary general Antnio Guterres has called for a truce in the IsraelGaza war as the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan begins He also urged the release of hostages held by Hamas and the removal of all obstacles to ensure the delivery of lifesaving aid at the speed and massive scale required to Gaza

The UN has warned that at least 576000 people in Gaza  a quarter of the population  are on the brink of famine

Can you spot a deepfake

With about a quarter of the world heading to the polls this year experts fear that were only seeing the beginning of the impact AI deepfakes could have on elections  and that we are vastly underprepared to deal with them

The ability to deceive from AI has put the problem of mis and disinformation on steroids said Lisa Gilbert executive vicepresident of Public Citizen a group thats been pushing for regulation in the US of the use of AI in politics

Without clear safeguards or regulation the impact of AI on the election might come down to what voters can discern as real and not real

However a recent study by AI Literacy Lab found that about half of Americans surveyed cant tell the difference between human and AIgenerated text or images while another study by University College London found that voters cannot reliably detect speech deepfakes

So how worried should we be Watch our democracy and misinformation reporter Rachel Leingang explain more

This was Diane Abbotts response after the Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle sparked a fresh row by refusing to allow the veteran MP to ask a question during a heated session of prime ministers questions today which was dominated by discussions over a major Conservative donors comments about her

Earlier this week the Guardian revealed that Frank Hester the Tory partys biggest donor said in 2019 that Abbott made him want to hate all black women and that she should be shot

At PMQs the Labour leader Keir Starmer and Stephen Flynn the Scottish National party leader in Westminster both used their questions to raise the controversy but Hoyle provoked groans in the chamber by ending the 35minute session without having called on Abbott who sits as an independent after losing the Labour whip last year

In a comment piece for the Guardian Abbott who is the UKs longestserving black MP said Hesters remarks left her upset but not surprised given the amount of racist abuse she receives 

Abbott also accused the Conservatives of aiming to play the race card in the general election To read her full oped tap the link in bio
How low would he have to sink

The leader of the Labour party Keir Starmer began his address to Rishi Sunak at PMQs today by asking if the prime minister is proud to be bankrolled by someone using racist and misogynist language

Sunak is facing scathing criticism for refusing to pay back the 10m major donor Frank Hester gave his party after the Guardian reported on Monday that Hester had said at meetings that seeing Diane Abbott on TV made you just want to hate all black women and that Britains longestserving black MP should be shot 

During PMQs Sunak said The alleged comments were wrong They were racist He has rightly apologised for them and that remorse should be accepted

On Tuesday night No 10 called the comments racist and wrong after mounting pressure Earlier in the day government ministers had suggested Hesters comments were not related to Abbotts race and gender

Its horrifying and extremely sad to see that two to three people are hanged in Iran every single day without strong international reactions says Mahmood AmiryMoghaddam the director of Iran Human Rights IHRNGO

The organisation this week jointly published the 16th Annual Report on the Death Penalty in Iran along with ecpmasso 

amirymoghaddam suggests that the increase in capital punishment in 2023 came as a reaction to nationwide protests prompted by the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022 The killing of the 22yearolds who was detained allegedly for not wearing a headscarf properly led to the largest wave of popular unrest for years in Iran

AmiryMoghaddam believes the data shows the Iranian authorities are using the death penalty as an instrument to instil fear in society

At least 22 women were executed last year marking the highest number in the past decade the report added

But this isnt the only way that the Iranian regime has been responding to the woman life freedom protests

A UN factfinding mission on Friday said the regime had carried out widespread and sustained human rights violations against its own people during its brutal suppression of protests in 2022

Their new report also investigated and corroborated accounts published in the Guardian that female protesters had been specifically targeted because of their gender and were shot at close range in the face breasts and genitals  actions the report cites as evidence of crimes committed by the state against the civilian population

Tumblemageddon is how residents described the scenes as towns in Utah were inundated with tumbleweeds as wind gusts of over 100kmh 65mph hit the state over the weekend

The weeds formed piles up to three metres high 10 feet in some places in South Jordan which lies south of state capital Salt Lake City

In America tumbleweeds are formed by invasive weeds called Russian thistle Each winter after the plants die the bushy parts snap off at the roots and blow away tumbling across the landscape to disperse seeds

Strong winds damaged city infrastructure according to ABC4 as well as knocking over trees and damaging roads throughout Utah

Luckily its something we can handle said Rachel Van Cleave South Jordan communications manager This is not our first tumblemageddon

The incident was not without precedent In Washington state in 2020 unlucky drivers saw in the new year trapped under a glut of 15ft tumbleweeds after the plants forced authorities to close a highway in both directions And in California in 2018 tumbleweeds shut down a whole town

In 2016 a type of tumbleweed known as hairy panic inundated an entire Australian town

Defying the Kremlins warning of arrests thousands of mourners gathered in Moscow to bid farewell to the opposition leader Alexei Navalny two weeks after Vladimir Putins most prominent critic died in an Arctic prison

Crowds of people chanted Putin is a murderer and No to war as they marched under heavy police presence to the Borisovsky cemetery where Navalny was lowered into the ground on Friday to the strains of Frank Sinatras My Way

The public show of support turned Navalnys last journey into a rare display of dissent in Russia at a time of unprecedented repression

Accompanied by loud applause and chants of Navalny the hearse carrying his coffin arrived at the Quench My Sorrows church in the Maryino district where the late politician used to live before he was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in 2020

Video footage showed mourners throwing flowers at the hearse as it drove away from the church towards the cemetery

Many of the thousands who came to pay their respects said they understood the risks of attending amid warnings of possible arrests but decided to come anyway

At least 67 people were arrested during tributes to Navalny across Russia according to the monitoring group OVDInfo Human rights experts said those who attended the funeral could be added to a database and possibly punished at a later date

More than 250000 people were watching the livestream of the funeral on YouTube that Navalnys team set up despite reports that the authorities had interrupted internet access around the church

More than a hundred Palestinians were killed in the early hours of Thursday morning Gaza health officials said when desperate crowds gathered around aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire in an incident that the US president Joe Biden warned was likely to complicate ceasefire talks

There were different accounts of how the victims died in the chaos that took place near Gaza City in the north of the strip

Israels military denied shooting into large crowds of hungry people and said most were killed in a crush or run over by trucks trying to escape Soldiers only fired at a small group that moved away from the trucks and threatened a checkpoint a spokesperson said

As the UN security council convened an emergency session on Thursday night the White House called for the deaths to be thoroughly investigated and reminded Israel that it needs to provide basic security in areas of Gaza under its control

What happened is unbelievable even in your worst nightmares

Dr Simon Fitzgerald and Dr Osaid Alser two trauma surgeons living in the US set up a group chat in January to help guide doctors at the Nasser hospital in southern Gaza on the treatment of civilian trauma patients

Less than a year ago the hospital in Khan Younis was the base of 10 surgeons and 10 surgical trainees During Israels offensive in Gaza the hospital was left with diminishing staff and without enough resources to treat patients

In February Israeli forces began targeting the hospital saying hundreds of militants were hiding in the hospital and some had posed as medical staff The IDF said it had arrested more than 100 suspected Hamas militants in the hospital compound Hamas dismissed the allegations saying they served as a pretext to destroy the healthcare system 

Gazas hospitals have been a focal point of the fourmonthold war between Israel and Hamas Most of the territorys hospitals have been put out of action by fighting and lack of fuel leaving a population of 23 million without proper healthcare

A New York City medical school plans to be tuitionfree for students after a 1bn donation from a wealthy donor

The Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx borough received the sizable donation from Dr Ruth Gottesman a 93yearold former professor at the school

Im happy to share with you that starting in August this year the Albert Einstein College of Medicine will be tuition free Gottesman announced to rapturous applause in a video posted to X on Monday

The donation is among the largest to date for an educational institution in the US the Times reported

Gottesman received the money from her late husband David Gottesman who went by Sandy Sandy Gottesman made his fortune from investing in Berkshire Hathaway the multinational conglomerate that was built by the billionaire Warren Buffett

When Gottesmans husband died in 2022 at the age of 96 he left her a sizable stock portfolio with instructions to do whatever you think is right with it she said to the Times

I wanted to fund students at Einstein so that they would receive free tuition she said

Half of Einsteins most recent class of students are New Yorkers according to the medical school  59 are women and the majority are people of color And Einsteins students graduate with higher amounts of debt than other medical students at New York City schools

Gottesman told the Times that she hopes her donation will help alleviate the financial burden graduating students face She said she also hopes that it makes medical school more accessible to those who could not previously afford it

Every morning since Stephens death whether Ive got an alarm set or not I get up fighting says Doreen Lawrence

Because no one is giving me anything and the situation facing black communities will not get better on its own she adds

Twentyfive years after the publication of the damning Macpherson inquiry report into her sons murder the social justice campaigner accuses Londons police force of arrogance and resistance to change

Its souldestroying to know what could have been  that those with the power to do so didnt make the changes that would have saved families from so much suffering

Last year a report by Louise Casey again identified a culture of institutional racism as well as sexism and homophobia in the Metropolitan police

Lawrence who was 18 years old was killed in a racist attack by a group of five or six white youths in southeast London in 1993 but only two of his killers have faced justice Gary Dobson and David Norris were jailed for life in 2012

In Britain today when some people say black lives dont matter I believe that to be true which is sad Too many mothers have lost sons Are we going to carry on talking about this for the next 25 years Change must come says Doreen Lawrence in an article for the Guardian

Have you ever thought about what happens to the skin of smoked salmon that is sold in restaurants and supermarkets

It is usually disposed of or used in fertiliser and biofuel But in recent years the fashion industry has followed in the footsteps of the Hezhen and Nivkh Indigenous groups in China and Siberia starting to making leather from salmon skins

Isabelle Taylor began making salmon leather when she was at university and lived above a fishmonger Having studied fashion and being in search of a sustainable solution she began experimenting with the discarded salmon skins and has created her own method for cleaning and tanning

She explains that the use of byproducts as a sustainable solution can be controversial because it could increase the demand for the fish But she says that in her case if the fishing industry stopped disposing of their skins I wouldnt go fishing for more skins Id find a different industry where other resources are getting wasted

In the case of the much more widespread cow hide the UK Environmental Investigation Agency EIA said that describing cow hide as a byproduct was misleading

I wouldnt call them byproducts The margins for the meat industry are quite narrow so all of the saleable parts of the animal are built into the business model said Rick Jacobsen commodity policy manager at the EIA Nonmeat products account for just under a half a slaughtered cows weight and can generate up to a quarter of meatpackers incomes according to estimates by Bain  Co a market research group

We spoke with skinnedpotential about why she makes fish leather from her small studio in Cambridge what the process is like and about just how strong fish leather actually is

Western officials have estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have died in the conflict which has evolved into what experts call the worlds first full scale drone war with hundreds of the devices firing explosives every day

But in the past 12 months the frontline has barely moved and some say a stalemate has been reached

Motaz Azaiza should have been dead by now Death stalked the streets of Deir alBalah where he grew up long before Israels assault on Gaza There had been close encounters in the past as a teen he was once shot by an Israeli sniper

When Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the 7 October Hamas attacks Azaiza picked up his camera and headed to the frontlines Despite his clearly marked press vest in December he narrowly avoided being hit again by Israeli forces

Israel denies targeting journalists but according to a group of UN experts more than 122 journalists and media professionals in Gaza have been killed so far the deadliest conflict for members of the press in recent history

Two weeks after being evacuated from Gaza the 25yearold Palestinian  who has amassed 185 million followers on Instagram  sat down with the Guardian to share his experiences of the war

In the days leading up to his evacuation motazazaiza says Israeli drones hovered above his home and he began receiving death threats from unknown numbers The bombs got closer and louder I would lie awake in my bed thinking Any moment now I will be next he says He has lost count of the number of friends he has lost

Although Azaiza has lived through many Israeli offensives he says this has been by far the worst Its unlike anything weve ever experienced he says Through his lens the rest of the world was able to witness the devastation in Gaza  often in the form of raw unfiltered videos of those killed or injured

Im not a celebrity nor would I ever want to be Before this I was a very private person says Azaiza

I wish people knew me for my art he says Before the war Azaiza would create portraits of ordinary Palestinians doing everyday things a fruit seller at the market a picnic on the beach children chasing one another down a cobbled street I wanted to capture the beauty of my people he says

The sooty air pollution spewed out by cars trucks and factories is causing widespread harm to peoples hearts and lungs even with the smallest amounts of exposure with government regulations still routinely allowing for dangerous risks to public health two major new studies have found

There is no safe amount of a microscopic form of airborne pollution known as PM25 consisting of tiny particles of soot measuring less than the width of a human hair for heart and lung health US researchers found with even small amounts raising the risk of potentially serious problems

And at the same time according to figures from the European Environment Agency in a separate study approximately 238000 air pollution deaths could be avoided each year if the EU27 countries actually met World Health Organization guidelines for air pollution

The new research from academics looking at 41 European countries also showed that more than half of the benefits would come from fewer deaths from heart attacks strokes and type 2 diabetes as well as lungcancer

And they say greater ambition would yield even bigger health outcomes

International law states that launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life injury or damage to civilian objects which would be excessive is prohibited However rapid urbanisation means more people than ever are living in cities and increasingly military objectives are being found in civilian areas

As a result in cities where there are conflicts civilians account for 90 percent of the casualties according to the United Nations neelamtailor explains just how destructive the use of large weapons like Israels Iron Sting can be on densely populated areas such as Gaza

A blueprint is emerging for a second Donald Trump term that is even more extreme for the environment than his first according to interviews with multiple allies and advisers of the expresident

In contrast to a sometimes chaotic first White House term they outlined a far more methodical possible second presidency for Trump driving forward fossil fuel production sidelining mainstream climate scientists and overturning rules that curb planetheating emissions

70 of Americans  strikingly including 50 of Republicans  want meaningful action on the climate crisis But that isnt reflected in Republican campaigning

Trump says he doesnt believe human activity contributes to global heating nor that climate change is making extreme weather worse and is opposed to efforts to boost clean energy

Bidens record on climate may be criticised by campaigners but his record in office places him firmly against such Republican views

The US the worlds second biggest carbon polluter would still see its emissions drop under Trump due to previous policies and a marketled shift away from coal to gas as an energy source but at only half the rate of a second Biden term according to an analysis by Energy Innovation shared with the Guardian

This would deal a mortal blow to the global effort to restrain dangerous global heating with scientists warning that the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half this decade and eliminate them entirely by 2050 to avoid breaching agreed temperature limits and plunge billions of people into worsening heatwaves floods and droughts

The Palestinian people only demand respect for their rights They ask for nothing more They cannot accept nothing less and nothing else

This is what Riyad Mansour the Palestinian ambassador to the UN said at the opening of the International Court of Justice ICJ hearings on Israels occupation of the Palestinian territories

Mansour held back tears as he appealed to the ICJ judges to help secure a twostate solution in which the two states live side by side in peace and security

Israeli leaders have long disputed that the territories  the West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem  are formally occupied on the basis that they were captured from Jordan and Egypt during a 1967 war rather than from a sovereign Palestine

More than 50 states will present arguments before the ICJ in The Hague until 26 February after a 2022 request from the UN general assembly for an advisory or nonbinding opinion on the occupation

The judges are expected to take several months to deliberate before issuing their opinion

Alexei Navalny was the last beacon of hope for anything to change and that hope died today said Elmira a Moscow resident as people came to commemorate the late Russia opposition activist

Hundreds of mourners gathered in cities across Europe and beyond over the weekend to express their outrage chanting slogans critical of Vladimir Putin whom many blame for the activists death and holding up signs calling Putin a killer and demanding accountability

In Russia some protesters resorted to daring political stunts In the central city of Izhevsk supporters hung up a large poster saying Navalny was killed in front of the local headquarters of the FSB security services

More than 350 people have been detained at the impromptu memorial services across 32 Russian cities since the death of Navalny according to OVDInfo a group that monitors political repression in Russia

The death of Navalny once Vladimir Putins most significant political challenger is a watershed moment for Russias shattered prodemocracy movement which has largely been jailed or driven into exile since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022

Navalny 47 died while being held in jail on 16 February at 217pm said his official spokesperson Kira Yarmysh citing a message from his mother and challenging Russias official explanation that he died after a fall at the Arctic penal colony where he was being held

Polar bears in Canadas Hudson Bay risk starvation as the climate crisis lengthens periods without Arctic Sea ice according to new research carried out by the US Geological Survey USGS

The marine mammals use the ice that stretches across the ocean surface in the Arctic during colder months to help them access prey

But humancaused climate breakdown is extending this icefree period in parts of the Arctic  which is heating between two and four times faster than the rest of the world  and forcing the polar bears to spend more and more time on land

New research used video camera GPS collars to track the polar bears for threeweek periods over the course of three years in the western Hudson Bay

Polar bears are creative theyre ingenious they will search the landscape for ways to try to survive and find food resources said Anthony Pagano the lead author of the study

But the bears efforts to find food on land did not provide them with enough calories to match their normal marine mammal prey

This is another piece of evidence that really raises that alarm said World Wildlife Fund which is not associated with the study

The worlds 25000 polar bears in the wild are endangered primarily by the climate crisis

Limiting planetheating greenhouse gases and keeping global heating under the Paris deal target of 15C above preindustrial levels would be likely to preserve polar bear populations Pagano said

But global temperatures are already at 12C and they continue to rise as sea ice dwindles

Amin Nuru his wife and their five children live in a onebedroom flat in Lambeth London where the walls have become riddled with damp and black mould

Doctors told the family they must urgently move out after the couples daughter suffered serious illness But an initial environmental health inspection found that their living situation did not meet the statutory overcrowded threshold and their case for emergency rehousing was closed

Campaigners have described the living conditions as the slums of the 21st century and have called for local councils to do more to help families like Nurus

Since filming this video Lambeth council carried out a review of Nurus case which concluded that the familys home falls within the standard definition of overcrowding

Lambeth does everything it can to find the most suitable homes available for families who come to us for help but in the face of high demand and a severe shortage of social housing this will often take some time a Lambeth council spokesperson said

The 7thcentury mosque also known as the Great Mosque of Gaza was Gazas most famous and its surroundings a focal point of the Palestinian enclaves history and culture but the damage done to its heritage over more than 100 days of Israeli bombardment spreads across the city

For the few Palestinians who remain and the far greater number displaced and hoping to return the culture and history has been reduced to memories

The city is a ghost town people walk around with pale faces and their spirits are tired after having gone through this war If you walk to the old city of Gaza you will only remember the memories and feel sickened and saddened by the amount of destruction of cultural and religious sites said Bader Alzaharna who lives in Gaza City despite the intensity of Israels ground operation in the area

A recent report by the Palestinian culture ministry into Israeli damage to Palestinian heritage said Israels bombardment of Gaza had destroyed 207 buildings of cultural or historical significance including 144 in the old city and 25 religious sites

Men would you use a contraceptive pill This Valentines day the gift of effective male contraception might not be as far away as you might think

Male birth control is undergoing some major developments across the world  from gels to nonhormonal pills  which could even the playing field when it comes to the balance of birth control responsibility between the sexes

While the number of contraceptive options for cisgender women and people with uteruses have grown ever the introduction of the hormonal birth control pill in the 1960s  which helped revolutionise the lives of many women across the world by giving them control over their fertility  the available birth control options for cisgender men and people with penises remain minimal

This has left women facing the overwhelming share of responsibility  and side effects  for birth control But now this could potentially change

If we were to focus on tackling huge methane leaks in the waste sector it could be a gamechanger experts have said after a Guardian investigation found there have been more than 1000 uncontrolled leaks of the potent greenhouse gas from landfill waste dumps since 2019

Analysis of global satellite data shows the populous nations of south Asia are a hotspot for these superemitter events as well as Argentina and Spain developed countries where proper waste management should prevent leaks

Landfills emit methane when organic waste such as food scraps wood card paper and garden waste decompose in the absence of oxygen

Methane also called natural gas traps 86 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over 20 years making it a critical target for climate action Scientists have said emissions from unmanaged landfills could double by 2050 as urban populations grow blowing the chance of avoiding climate catastrophe

A total of 1256 methane superemitter events occurred between January 2019 and June 2023 according to the new data Pakistan India and Bangladesh lead the list of nations with the most large leaks followed by Argentina Uzbekistan and Spain

Do you think blue cards will be good for football 

Players could be shown blue cards and sent to a sinbin for dissent and cynical fouls under plans to be unveiled by the body that decides the laws of the game

Sitting alongside the current yellow and red cards a blue card would result in a player being removed from the field of play for 10 minutes 

At risk of muddying the palette there will also be the possibility to mix colours If a player returns from the sinbin and receives another blue card they would also be shown a red card and be permanently dismissed from the game A combination of one blue and one yellow meanwhile would also make a red

The recommendations are set to be made by the International Football Association Board Ifab on Friday ahead of trials across competitions

The Football Association was reported to be exploring the possibility of using the FA Cup as part of the trials process though Fifa the global governing body have since said it would be premature to involve elite competitions in the trials

Rhinos have for more than a century been hunted and poached for their horns which are sold in illegal wildlife markets and the species is critically endangered meaning there is a very high chance of it becoming extinct in the wild

But a UK wildlife park has now welcomed a rare black baby rhino for the first time in its history which could have a significant impact on international conservation efforts to protect the species

The male calf who already weighs 73 kilos arrived at Yorkshire Wildlife Park YWP in Doncaster on 16 January  with the zoo allowing him to explore the outdoor reserve this week

His mother Najuma who was pregnant for 15 months before giving birth first began showing early signs of pregnancy over a year ago and rangers continually monitored her The sevenyearold and the new arrivals father Makibo eight joined the wildlife park in 2018 as part of an international breeding programme

Director of animals at YWP Dr Charlotte MacDonald said Every birth is a milestone in our global conservation efforts The aim is to ensure we are in a position to increase reintroductions into the wild

Shame said the Labour leader Keir Starmer as he angrily confronted Rishi Sunak in parliament when the prime minister derided Labours policy on transgender rights after being told the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the public gallery

Of all the weeks to say that when Briannas mother is in this chamber  Starmer said

Other opposition MPs shouted shame at Sunak while critics also took to X to denounce the PMs jibe including Anneliese Dodds the shadow secretary for women and equalities who tweeted This isnt the first time Rishi Sunak has used LGBT people as a punchline to a cruel joke But making jokes about trans people in front of the mother of Brianna Ghey is a shameful new low

Sunak ignored Starmers comments in his next reply during PMQs and when asked later in the session by Labours Liz Twist to apologise to Briannas mother he ignored the question despite shouts of apologise from the opposition benches

At the end of PMQs Sunak praised Esther Ghey saying she represented the very best of humanity  He did not apologise however

It is understood that while Sunak made the comments after being told Ghey was watching she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed the initial exchange

Downing Street said afterwards the prime minister stood by what he said in the chamber and said it was legitimate for him to highlight Starmers Uturns

Starmer has been accused of backsliding on transgender rights after Uturning on his promise to introduce selfidentification for trans people if Labour were to win the general election last July

After PMQs Starmer met Esther Ghey Briannas mother She is campaigning for a ban on under16s using social media on smartphones In a BBC interview this weekend Esther said her daughter might have been saved if the online searches being made by her eventual killers had been flagged to their parents

A pod of at least 10 orcas were filmed trapped in drift ice off the coast of Japan appearing to stick their heads out of the water to breathe

The tightly packed orcas were stuck about 1km off the coast of Rausu on the Shiretoko peninsula a Unesco world heritage site famed for its abundant wildlife 

The coastguard was unable to rescue the mammals as the ice was too thick

We have no choice but to wait for the ice to break up and for them to escape that way a Rausu official told public broadcaster NHK on Tuesday

The largest cetaceans can spend long periods underwater but killer whales generally stay submerged for only several minutes at a time

The orcas were eventually able to free themselves from the drift ice local officials were reported as saying on Wednesday

A Guardian investigation has detailed the mass destruction of buildings and land in three neighbourhoods in Gaza

Using satellite imagery and opensource evidence the investigation found damage to more than 250 residential buildings 17 schools and universities 16 mosques three hospitals three cemeteries and 150 agricultural greenhouses

Entire buildings have been levelled fields flattened and places of worship wiped off the map in the course of Israels war against Hamas in Gaza launched after the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October

The destruction in Gaza has not only forced 19 million people to leave their homes but also made it impossible for many to return

The Israeli military says that its fight is against Hamas and not Gaza that its bombardment is proportional to the threat posed by Hamas and that it is making every effort to warn citizens of imminent attacks

An IDF spokesperson told the Guardian Hamas operates nearby underneath and within densely populated areas as a matter of routine operational practice As part of the IDFs operations it has been carrying out strikes on military targets as well as locating and destroying infrastructure when imperatively required to achieve the goals of the war

Quite a surprise

A king penguin has been filmed on a South Australia coastline raising questions about why the bird is thousands of kilometres away from its usual subAntarctic habitat

Jeff Campbell the chair of Friends of Shorebirds South East was part of a group of eight people doing a bird survey along the Coorong beach when they spotted the penguin It came right up to us  It put its head back and made a braying call quite loud then bowed to us he said

The bird usually found on subantarctic islands believed to be undergoing annual moulting on land at Coorong beach

They are close relatives of the larger emperor penguins but prefer the subantarctic islands to the Antarctic ice shelf

Dr Julie McInnes from the University of Tasmanias Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies Ecology and Biodiversity says that the Australian mainland was the furthest these penguins could go  and that while global heating was causing changes in penguins distribution that would probably cause them to seek cooler water

It could also just be that the penguin got off track looking for land  usually they would moult on their colonys island

A New York City jury awarded 833m to E Jean Carroll in her defamation trial against Donald Trump on Friday

Carroll will receive 183m in compensatory damages and 65m in punitive retribution

The Manhattan federal court decision comes less than one year after Carroll won 5m in her sexual abuse and defamation trial against the expresident

This sum stems from Carrolls rape claim against the president in a June 2019 New York magazine article The publication ran an excerpt of her thenforthcoming book What Do We Need Men For A Modest Proposal

In that excerpt Carroll said that Trump raped her inside the dressing room of a luxe Manhattan department store around early 1996 

The tenor of Trumps denials  saying for example that she lied and was a political operative  became the subject of her 2019 defamation suit against him

At the time Carroll could not sue Trump over the alleged assault as it would have taken place outside the civil statute of limitations A novel New York state law in 2022 the Adult Survivors Act opened a oneyear window for adult accusers to file suit for incidents outside the civil statute of limitations

Carroll filed another lawsuit this one over the incident and defamatory statements after Trumps presidency ended This lawsuit proceeded to trial first and the judge in both cases Lewis Kaplan determined jurors findings  that Trump sexually abused Carroll and tarnished her reputation  would be accepted as fact in this trial

As a result Trump could not relitigate her sexual abuse claim The jurors were tasked only with weighing financial penalties for damaging Carrolls reputation  and the sum required to keep Trump from making still more defamatory statements

Im here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it he said it never happened Carroll said on the stand He lied and it shattered my reputation I expected him to deny it but to say it was consensual when it was not But thats what I expected him to say

The UNs top court the international court of justice ICJ has ordered Israel to take all measures within its power to ensure its forces do not commit acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza It also ordered Israel to take measures to prevent and punish the direct incitement of genocide in the war

However the interim ruling on South Africas allegation that the war in Gaza amounts to genocide against Palestinians stopped short of ordering a halt to Israeli military action in Gaza South Africa had asked the court to order an immediate ceasefire

The presiding judge Joan Donoghue said the court was deeply concerned by the continuing loss of life and human suffering and ruled that it would not grant Israels request to throw out the case The court also ordered immediate measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza

South Africa described the ruling in The Hague as a decisive victory for the international rule of law and said it sincerely hoped Israel would not frustrate the application of the order

Israels prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said We will continue to defend ourselves and our citizens while adhering to international law adding that the ICJs willingness to discuss genocide claims against Israel was a disgrace that will not be erased for generations

The ICJ rulings are binding and cannot be appealed against although the court has no power to enforce them To read our full coverage tap the link in bio

A boarding school in Massachusetts has wrapped up the first year of a simple yet novel experiment banning cellphones on campus Or rather smartphones

Instead the school Buxton gave everyone on campus  including staff  a Light Phone that is a dumb phone with limited functionality They are about the size of a deck of cards with black and white screens As one student put it Its like the demon baby of an iPad and a Kindle

Most everyone agrees however that the school is better off without smartphones And yes that includes students There are fewer interruptions during class more meaningful interactions around campus and less time spent on screens

Educators across the country report waging a nearconstant battle against phones A survey of a school district in Virginia found that about a third of teachers were telling students to put away their cellphones five to 10 times a class and 147 did so more than 20 times a class

When the no smartphone policy was announced Buxton saw a progression through the stages of panic grief and ultimately some level of acceptance

I practically had a breakdown said then senior Max Weeks And while hes still not a fan of what he says was a unilateral decision to switch to the Light Phone he said overall the experience hasnt been as bad as I expected

How should assaults in the metaverse be handled

British police are investigating the virtual sexual assault of a girl identified only as being under the age of 16 in what is said to be the first investigation of its kind in the UK

The girl was reportedly wearing a virtual reality headset and playing an immersive game in the metaverse when her avatar was attacked by several others

An unnamed senior officer said the victim did not suffer physical harm but experienced psychological trauma that was similar to that of someone who has been physically raped according to an exclusive report in the Daily Mail

But in criminal law rape and sexual assault require there to have been physical contact

We spoke with Nina Jane Patel a psychotherapist and VR expert whose research investigates the physiological and psychological intricacies of the metaverse

ninajanepatel who has experienced being sexually assaulted in the metaverse herself in 2021 speaks about the realities of crimes in the metaverse the ethics of who is held accountable and what the future could look like if we dont take cases like this seriously

There is no but when it concerns genderbased violence The use of sexual violence in conflict to coerce terrorise sow fear or for any other reason is no exception

Deborah Lipstadt the US special envoy to combat antisemitism and Michle Taylor the US permanent representative to the UN human rights council say the failure to respond to the reports of sexual violence by Hamas are not just a failure of justice but also a sign of deeper biases that must be addressed

This fight transcends borders and cultural divides In recognising the horrific experiences of Israeli women we also need to manifestly acknowledge that Palestinian women and girls are victims and survivors of genderbased violence Rape and mutilation of women are never acceptable they said writing in the Guardian

This is something on which we all must agree  regardless of our position on the broader conflict the pair added as they described how they are both deeply troubled  and remain so  by the slow response of international organisations governments and civil society to these horrific occurrences on 7 October

Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammad were among the first journalists to break the news of the death of Mahsa Amini the young Kurdish woman whose death in custody sparked nationwide protests in 2022

Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are vying for second place Whoever takes second place albeit a distant one to Trumps commanding lead will see more momentum in their campaign Its possible the field will winnow down more after the caucus results

The first contest kicks off the 2024 election cycle which is predicted to be an eventual rematch between Trump and Biden Already threats of political violence loom over the election as officials and judges face increasing harassment

As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by Israels attacks across the strip continue to worsen the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees UNRWA has said that aid alone will not be sufficient to reverse a looming famine A flow of commercial goods must also be allowed in

Writing for the Guardian the British foreign secretary and former prime minister David Cameron has urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza saying it will do nothing for hostages held in the territory or Israels war aims if the situation turns into an even greater catastrophe

Metito and Naneu were among 14 women in Kenya and Ghana who took part in a programme by lensational a social enterprise that supports underrepresented women to learn photography and document the changes happening in their lives on issues such as climate breakdown

Female photographers trained by Lensational say visual storytelling is a powerful tool for their community which faces marginalisation and illiteracy and a way to disrupt the barriers that often keep their realities and perspectives from full view

The most uptodate figures show the worlds most popular dating app Tinder saw its users drop by 5 in 2021 while shares in both Bumble and Match Group which owns Tinder have declined steadily over the last couple of years

It does not matter how handsome or beautiful or charming you are there is this underlying tension that you are 10 swipes away from a person that outranks you on the conventional beauty and charisma scale says Dylan FreemanGrist a 29yearold living in Toronto Canada Its enough to make you feel all the insecurities that you havent needed to swallow since you were a teenager and a whole ream of new adult ones

Kuo Chiu known as KC to his friends teaches urban design at Tunghai University in Taiwan but in his spare time is practising rifle skills in the event of a feared Chinese invasion

Although the Chinese Communist party CCP has never ruled Taiwan it claims the territory as part of the Peoples Republic of China and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve its longstated ambition of reunification

This has led to many civilians like KC to turn to medical and combat training to protect themselves

The devastation we submit  is intended to and has laid waste to Gaza beyond any acceptable legal let alone humane justification said advocate of the high court of South Africa Adila Hassim as they outlined South Africas case against Israel in the International Courts of Justice at The Hague

South Africa has brought a case to the ICJ accusing Israel of committing genocide in its military response to the 7 October Hamas attack in which 1200 Israelis mainly civilians were killed The case refers to ways they believe Israel has violated the UNs Genocide Convention including the mass killing of civilians and what it alleges is an assault on the health system and the imposition of conditions on Gaza that cannot sustain life

All of these acts individually and collectively form a calculated pattern of conduct by Israel indicating a genocidal intent Hassim told the court

Israel has described South Africas case as baseless and a blood libel and will have three hours at the court tomorrow to oppose it

It tells our country our society the world that we are running out of tolerance for what is happening to young people said the actor and musician Idris Elba as he called for more urgent action on youth knife violence

We have to offer solutions Elba told the Guardian as he urged for the immediate banning of machetes and zombie knives and more funding for youth services

The star of Luther and The Wire launched his Dont Stop Your Future campaign this week which aims to help put an end to knife crime and amplify the voices of marginalised communities

Knife crime in England and Wales is now 75 higher than in 201213 according to the Youth Endowment Funds analysis of police data

The sale of zombie knives was largely banned in 2016 with the threat of prison time attached But by last April ministers were still talking about the need to close a legal loophole before the weapons could in effect be considered banned

Progress on passing new legislation has been slow and several highprofile incidents have occurred since it was promised including the killing of the schoolgirl Elianne Andam in south London in September

With someone like myself that has this platform its not that I am more qualified to speak on this said idriselba It  takes a group of us

He added Whats really important is that we are listened to as a society whether Idris says it or a youth campaigner says it

My husband never spoke to me of what happened He was diagnosed with cancer a few years later and Im tortured by the thought that the stress might have contributed to his illness

Vivienne Hammond 88 told the Guardian she was traumatised by discovering what her late husband Dennis must have suffered in secret during the last 20 years of his life when she watched ITVs dramatisation of the Horizon scandal

Hollywood has predicted a nightmare year ahead 

The consensus seems to be that homo sapiens wont be doing so hot by this year falling victim either to our own rapacious destruction of the planet or each other but with a savior never too far off to change the course of history

In examining the varied canon of movies set in 2024 a viewer samples a slideshow of worstcase scenarios each leaving some back door or way out

In more than one case the filmmakers intended their work as a challenge to heed their words of caution before all hope for the continuation of civilization was lost And if humanity does stand a chance then maybe we can chart a path forward by following in the footsteps of the Highlander

When more than 900 pages of legal documents relating to the case of convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein were made public on Wednesday night it caused an online frenzy that crashed the court website hosting the files in minutes

The papers were unsealed late in the day identifying numerous Epstein associates and public figures as mentioned in proceedings of the case Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre filed against Ghislaine Maxwell in 2015

Maxwell the USbased British socialite and media heir was convicted in New York in December 2021 of sex trafficking and similar charges for procuring teen girls for Epstein  who died in jail awaiting federal sextrafficking charges in 2019

This next batch of records had remained sealed because of concerns about the privacy rights of Epsteins victims and other people whose names had come up during the legal battle but were not complicit in his crimes

By the time you are reading this the bosses of Britains biggest companies have made more money than the average UK worker will in the entire year according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else in the country

The High Pay Centre a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers said that by 1pm on the third working day of the year a FTSE 100 CEOs will have been paid more on an hourly basis than a UK workers annual salary of 34963 based on median average remuneration figures for both groups

Paul Nowak the general secretary of the TUC the umbrella body for UK trade unions said While working people have been forced to suffer the longest wage squeeze in modern history City bosses have been allowed to pocket bumper rises and bankers have been given unlimited bonuses

Last year the government scrapped an EU rule capping the bonuses of bankers at 100 of salary a measure that had been introduced in 2014 with the aim of avoiding another banking crisis

The average pay of CEOs has increased by 95 since March 2023 while workers median pay has increased by 6 The average pay of FTSE 100 CEOs dropped slightly during the pandemic but has since increased by about a quarter

The High Pay Centre also calculated how long it would take for other top earners to surpass the median UK workers fulltime earnings

Have you ever worn period pants

In the video our science presenter explains how some of them could pose health risks

Here are comments from two of the brands we talk about

Essity the owner of Bodyform and Modibodi said silver copper zeolite was used to prevent odour when wearing the pants for up to 12 hours It added that all of its washable underwear is certified according to OekoTex Standard 100 which means that every single component has been tested for harmful substances and that the underwear has been designated as harmless for human health

An MS spokesperson said We do not use either nano silver or silver zeolite and like many brands use a small amount of silver chloride in the middle part of the gusset  away from the skin  which is perfectly safe approved by the UK and EU and designed to combat odour

Transphobic bullying is rife says Newton Carey a 15yearold student who is also trans

This is how he responded after the UK government finally published its longdelayed guidance for Englands schools on youth transition which was proposed by Rishi Sunak earlier this year

The document promises a clear set of principles for teachers and staff as they wrestle with the needs of children who are questioning their gender identity

But while the guidance has been broadly welcomed by those who believe that it is currently too easy for young people to socially transition at school there are others who disagree vehemently

They see the governments approach as informed by an underlying hostility to trans people and scepticism about whether they even exist And although the guidance does not include an outright ban on allowing social transition said to have been under consideration until it was found to be unlawful it clearly creates new barriers for teenagers who want to talk to teachers about their gender without fear of being outed at home

The Colorado supreme court has declared Donald Trump ineligible to hold office again under the US constitutions insurrection clause

In a historic decision the justices ordered that he be removed from the states presidential primary ballot after determining that he engaged in insurrection on 6 January 2021 

The ruling sets up a likely showdown in the nations highest court to settle whether the January 6 attack on the Capitol amounted to an insurrection and whether Trumps involvement disqualifies him from running for office

Trump has vowed to appeal to the US supreme court his campaign said We have full confidence that the US supreme court will quickly rule in our favor and finally put an end to these unAmerican lawsuits said Steven Cheung a Trump campaign spokesperson

The 43 decision by the Colorado supreme court marks the first time a presidential candidate has been deemed unqualified for office under a rarely used provision that bars insurrectionists from holding office

The eruption began at about 1017pm local time on Monday after a series of small earthquakes at about 9pm the met office said

After the eruption the Icelandic prime minister Katrn Jakobsdttir said Now we see the earth opening up

She said her thoughts were with the people of the fishing town Grindavk who were evacuated from their homes last month soon after the seismic swarm first started saying We hope for the best

But she warned It can be clear that this is a considerable eruption

Fortunately last night when the volcano erupted the nearly 4000 inhabitants of the fishing town of Grindavik had already been evacuated

The destruction of more than a third of Gazas homes as Israel bombards the territory in pursuit of Hamas is leading international legal experts to raise the concept of domicide writes our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour in his latest Guardian analysis piece

In the current Gaza war launched after Hamas launched its 7 October terror attack on southern Israel independent experts estimate that as much as 40 of the housing in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed The United Nations says 18 million people are internally displaced inside the strip many living in overcrowded UN shelters in the south

Although Gaza has been damaged in previous conflicts and rebuilt largely with money from the Gulf states the current scale of the devastation is of a different order says Patrick

Israel says all damage to buildings and loss of civilian life is regrettable but made necessary by Hamas deliberately hiding in schools and hospitals and by its refusal to surrender

To hear why legal experts are calling for domicide to be classed as a distinct crime against humanity and whether the UN vote on a ceasefire earlier this week can change the situation on the ground listen to our Today in Focus podcast via the link in bio

It is no accident asylum seekers and refugees were among the 18m UK households experiencing destitution last year writes our editorinchief Katharine Viner in her most recent Guardian essay

We will not go silently to our watery graves those were the stern words from John Silk the head of the Marshall Islands delegation in response to a draft climate agreement at Cop28

The unequivocal condemnation of the draft by dozens of countries at the annual UN climate summit reflects the gravity of the situation for those who are facing the sharpest effects of the climate crisis

The negotiations started off in Dubai on a hopeful note even though it was being hosted in a country with deep connections to the oil industry But after two weeks of debate the mood had soured

A draft deal put forward by the summit presidency was criticised by delegates as being grossly insufficient incoherent unacceptable and unjust because it did not include any mention of either phasing out or phasing down the use of fossil fuels

After much anticipation the second draft was published in the early hours of Wednesday morning The crucial language has been toughened up and includes a reference to transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems  but countries now have to decide whether this change is enough for them a process that will take a while

So far the reviews are mixed

The Guardian can reveal that refugees and migrants are being buried in unmarked graves across the EU at a scale that is unprecedented outside of war

More than 1000 men women and children who died at the borders of Europe in the past decade were buried before they were identified our reporting team has found 

They lie in stark often blank graves along the borders  rough white stones overgrown with weeds in Sidiro cemetery in Greece crude wooden crosses on Lampedusa in Italy in northern France faceless slabs marked simply Monsieur X in Poland and Croatia plaques read NN for name unknown 

On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria one grave states Migrant boat number 4 25092022

The European parliament passed a resolution in 2021 acknowledging the right of those who die on migration routes to be identified and recognised the need for a coordinated database to collect details of the bodies

But across European countries the issue remains a legislative void with no centralised data nor any uniform process for dealing with the bodies piling up in morgues funeral parlours and shipping containers

Working with forensic scientists from the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC and other researchers NGOs and pathologists the Guardian and a consortium of reporters pieced together for the first time the numbers of migrants and refugees who died in the past decade along the EUs borders whose identities remain unknown 

At least 2162 bodies have still not been identified They are the tip of the iceberg

The Israeli military campaign in southern Gaza has been just as devastating as in the north said UN emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths creating apocalyptic conditions and ending any possibility of meaningful humanitarian operations

What were saying today is thats enough now It has to stop Griffiths said in an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday

Since the temporary ceasefire collapsed nearly a week ago Israeli forces and Hamas have been fighting housetohouse battles along the length of the Gaza Strip with devastating consequences for the civilian population Gazas hospitals have reported many civilians dead and injured with medical supplies dwindling

The UN chief Antnio Guterres on Wednesday invoked the rarely used Article 99 of the UN Charter for the first time in my tenure as secretary general which says he may inform the council of matters he believes threaten international peace He is expected to address the council to press for a ceasefire

But Israels UN ambassador Gilad Erdan has reacted to the move saying the secretary general invoked Article 99 to pressure Israel accusing the UN chief of a new moral low and bias against Israel

You would not invite arms dealers to a peace conference said David Tong from the organisation Oil Change International after revelations that a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists have been given access to this years Cop28 summit

At least 2456 fossil fuel lobbyists have been granted access to the climate conference  four times as many as at Cop27 in Sharm elSheikh which itself was a record year

Fossil fuel lobbyists at Cop28 outnumber
 official Indigenous representatives 316 by seven to one
 every countrys delegation apart from Brazil 3081 and Cop28 hosts the UAE 4409
 the number of delegates from the 10 most climate vulnerable countries combined including Somalia Solomon Islands and Sudan

These figures calculated by the Kick Big Polluters Out KBPO coalition raise further questions about the fossil fuel industrys influence over this years UN summit which is being run by the president of the United Arab Emirates national oil company

Momentum to secure commitment from countries around the world to phase out fossil fuels  which scientists say is needed to stop climate catastrophe  has been growing at Cop28 especially among the most vulnerable countries

Countries and communities are here negotiating for their lives while the fossil companies and their enablers are here for their wallets added Tong

Drue Slatter a Fijian member of the Pacific Climate Warriors said They are here in such big numbers because they are scared The people have spoken the science has spoken We need to get them out of these negotiations

Nearly six months of Boris Johnsons Whatsapp messages sent during the Covid19 pandemic are missing from the former prime ministers old phone

Johnson began two days of giving evidence to the Covid inquiry today where he denied deleting the messages His appearance has been the most eagerly awaited moment so far in an inquiry overseen by a former judge

As reported in the Guardian in October no WhatsApp messages from 31 January 2020 to 7 June that year covering the arrival of the virus and the period leading up to and after the first lockdown could be retrieved The Times has now reported that technical teams have still been unable to access the messages

A spokesperson for the former PM said Boris Johnson has fully cooperated with the inquirys disclosure process and has submitted hundreds of pages of material He has not deleted any messages The Times report refers to a technical issue in recovery of material that is for the technical team to address

While Johnsons WhatsApp messages would most likely be a significant source of information for the current module of the inquiry which is looking at government decision making the hope is that the bulk of his messages will be retained by those to whom he sent them who will have included them in their own evidence

Johnson who was PM between 20192022 stopped using the iPhone in question in May 2021 on security advice after it emerged that his phone number had been accessible online for at least 15 years

Some of the most eyecatching evidence seen so far has been from WhatsApp messages including ones setting out the worries of people working with Johnson about his Downing Street operation

What pictures can you see in this murmuration

Described as breathtaking 41yearold Roberto Biddau captured this starling murmuration taking place in Italy

Biddau zefiro82  a doctor from the Sardinian city of Sassari who filmed this video in November says he has enjoyed the murmuration of starlings that visits his home every around the same time every year

The birds meet in the city at sunset and go to rest in the trees he says They are migrating from north to south in autumn they arrive in Sassari and many people watch them

Why starlings murmurate is not fully understood One theory is that massive numbers help the birds keep warm before going to roost another is that it maximises each individuals chance of survival when under assault by aerial predators

How the birds move together in such close proximity as though one organism is another mystery One study from 2013 found that each starling was responding instantly to the six or seven birds closest to it to maintain group cohesion

The most hazardous nuclear site in Europe Sellafield has a worsening leak from a huge silo of radioactive waste that could pose a risk to the public the Guardian can reveal

Concerns over safety at the crumbling building as well as cracks in a reservoir of toxic sludge known as B30 have caused diplomatic tensions with countries including the US Norway and Ireland which fear Sellafield has failed to get a grip of the problems

The leak of radioactive liquid from one of the highest nuclear hazards in the UK  a decaying building at the vast Cumbrian site known as the Magnox swarf storage Silo MSSS  is likely to continue to 2050 That could have potentially significant consequences if it gathers pace risking contaminating groundwater according to an official document

Cracks have also developed in the concrete and asphalt skin covering the huge pond containing decades of nuclear sludge part of a catalogue of safety problems at the site

These concerns have emerged in Nuclear Leaks a yearlong Guardian investigation into problems spanning cyber hacking radioactive contamination and toxic workplace culture at the vast nuclear dump

Sellafield is understood to argue that the leak poses no additional risk to staff and the public

A spokesperson for the site said We are proud of our safety record at Sellafield and we are always striving to improve

The nature of our site means that until we complete our mission our highest hazard facilities will always pose a risk

We continuously measure and report on nuclear radiological and conventional safety

Farid and Qoosay Salout were born with severe craniofacial issues and a disorder that left their eyes abnormally far apart

For babies born with their condition surgical intervention would ideally start in the first year of life But there wasnt a single surgeon in Gaza who could perform the risky and highly specialized procedures the boys needed

The Gaza Strip is largely cut off from the world After Hamass electoral victory in 2006 Israel imposed a strict land sea and air blockade that has been going on for 17 years now contributing to a series of wars between the two of which this one is the fifth and most devastating

Primary care is almost nonexistent in Gaza  by extension the same is true of preventive care and early intervention when someone does have a medical issue

It was into this reality that the Salout boys were born Without outside intervention they didnt stand a chance

Thats where an organization called the Palestine Childrens Relief Fund stepped in After receiving a special permit to enter Israel for a visa interview at the US embassy the Salout brothers and their adult companion  their grandmother  were approved to travel

For their first flight to the US Farid and Qoosays grandmother dressed them up in threepiece suits

But on 8 November Farid Qoosay their little brother their father and six other relatives were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit their fourstory building in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza

We are living through climate collapse in real time the UN secretary general Antnio Guterres has told delegates at Cop28 which comes after a year where words such as unprecedented extreme recordbreaking and even hellish have become routine headlines when reporting on the climate crisis

And while global heating is disproportionately impacting poorer countries  whove done the least to contribute to it  no country can think itself immune from catastrophe said Simon Stiell the UNs top climate official

Were now at the point where were all on the frontline said Stiell speaking exclusively to the Guardian before the summit Yet most governments are still strolling when they need to be sprinting

But while the headlines can seem bleak we should not feel hopeless scientists say Researchers have urged a transition to a global economy that prioritises human wellbeing and cuts the overconsumption and excessive emissions of the rich

This year has seen communities around the world pounded by fires floods and searing temperatures  and the impact is devastating Guterres said Record global heating should send shivers down the spines of world leaders And it should trigger them to act

After 400 hours trapped inside a collapsed Himalayan tunnel in Indias northern Uttarakhand state all 41 construction workers were freed during a tense rescue operation

The men were working on the SilkyaraBarkot tunnel when a landslide on 12 November caused a part of it to cave in trapping them 200m away from the tunnels mouth

The men survived on oxygen and food packets containing dried chickpeas and fruits almonds and puffed rice that were funnelled to them through small pipes inserted into the cavity where they were trapped

The complex and delicate rescue operation faced risks and setbacks

After several attempts failed rescuers were forced to use vertical drilling to reach the trapped miners which officials warned could pose a huge threat to the mountains and destabilise the surrounding terrain due to its heavy vibrations

The drilling machine bored its way through the wall of rubble and then a rescue pipe wide enough for the men to be evacuated offered a way out

Do you have extreme reactions or sound rage when you hear small repetitive sounds that other people dont seem to notice

You might have a condition called misophonia says Dr Jane Gregory  a clinical psychologist at the University of Oxford author of Sounds Like Misophonia and a lifetime sufferer herself

Misophonia a condition that was largely unknown until the 2010s is a phenomenon whereby particular sounds can prove unbearable triggering physical and emotional reactions  from anxiety and panic to shame and anger

While only about 14 of the UK population have heard of the condition according to a scientific paper from Kings College London nearly one in five people in the UK suffer from it

Misophonia has 2648m views on TikTok while celebrities such as the comedian Seann Walsh have recently come forward about suffering from the condition

And while there may not be a total cure for misophonia Gregory says there are things that can really help  including creating new associations with the sounds that trigger you

The king is profiting from the deaths of thousands of people in the northwest of England whose assets are secretly being used to upgrade the Duchy of Lancaster a controversial land and property estate that generates huge profits for King Charles III

Tens of millions of pounds in recent years have been collected by the hereditary estate under an antiquated custom that dates back to feudal times known as bona vacantia or vacant goods

In England and Wales the assets of people who die without making a will and have no identifiable relatives are transferred to the Treasury which then spends them on public services

The only exception to this is for people who die in parts of England with historical links to two royal estates the Duchy of Lancaster which is the estate of King Charles and the Duchy of Cornwall which was inherited by Prince William

These two vast property empires are run by professional executives and exist to generate supposedly private income for the monarch and heir to the throne

Over the last 10 years the Duchy of Lancaster has collected more than 60m of such funds It has long claimed that after deducting costs bona vacantia revenues are donated to charities

However only a small percentage of these revenues is being given to charity Internal duchy documents seen by the Guardian reveal how funds are secretly being used to finance the renovation of properties that are owned by the king and rented out for profit

Private jets belonging to 200 celebrities CEOs oligarchs and billionaires have spent a combined total of 11 years in the air since the start of 2022

The carbon footprint of all those flights  a jawdropping 44739 journeys  would be the equivalent of the total emissions of almost 40000 people

The Guardian used public data to track flights by private aircraft owned by celebrities and businesspeople including Elon Musk the Rolling Stones the Murdoch family and Kylie Jenner over 21 months

The figures track the almost 300 jets belonging to those on the list and find that they emitted an estimated 415518 tonnes of CO2

The Guardians findings follow a sharp rise in private jet use since the Covid19 pandemic Last year private jet activity in Europe was at its highest level since a 2007 peak and forecasts indicate that sales of private jets are likely to reach their highest ever level this year

Not every flight analysed will have had the owner onboard About 40 of private flights carry no passengers as planes are moved around to pick people up Many jets may have also been used by friends family or business associates or lent to other individuals

The superrich are plundering and polluting the planet to the point of destruction and it is those who can least afford it who are paying the highest price says Chiara Liguori Oxfams senior climate justice policy adviser

A new report revealed by the Guardian shows we are not equally to blame for rising temperatures and that both the superrich and the middle class are disproportionately destroying the planet

The worlds richest 10  which encompasses most of the middle classes in developed countries  causes up to 40 times more climateheating carbon emissions than the poorest 10 of their fellow citizens

Failing to account for this huge wealthemitting divide when making policies to cut emissions can cause a backlash over the affordability of climate action experts say

The people of Delhi could have their lives shortened by 119 years due to the poor air they breathe according to this years airquality life index compiled by the University of Chicagos energy policy institute

We are in a city where breathing which is the basic human need feels terrible I struggle to imagine what the future will look like said Panday

I dont know what else to do I dont have a solution but its not my job to get a solution Its my job to demand my family back said Amit Zach the nephew of 72yearold Adina Moshe who was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October

Relatives of Israelis being held hostage have begun a 40mile march from Tel Aviv to Benjamin Netanyahus office in Jerusalem to demand the government does more to secure their release

I and my family also dont feel like were in good hands We dont feel like we get enough information We fell into the darkness We want answers said Zach as he marched

The families aim to march over five days camping in tents and arriving outside Netanyahus office on Saturday At the start of the march on Tuesday people fought back tears as they made impassioned pleas for the release of their loved ones

An estimated 1200 people were killed and more than 240 hostages were taken when Hamas militants stormed southern Israeli towns and kibbutzim on 7 October
Since October 7th its gotten much much much worse says 33yearold Israeli activist Sahar Vardi describing the increasing settler violence in the West Bank

Vardi a conscientious objector and activist who is Jewish Israeli refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces 15 years ago when she turned 18 Since then she has been working as an activist fighting against the occupation of Palestine and doing protective presence shifts

Made up of both international activists and Israeli activists were trying to be within Palestinian communities to go with Palestinians to do agricultural work harvesting grazing sheep and to try and just with our presence decrease the violence of settlers and soldiers explains Vardi

Jewish Israeli settlers believe the West Bank should be Jewish for religious and historical reasons although the settlements are illegal under international law

Vardi spoke with the Guardian about what those shifts entail and why she is calling for an end to Israels use of military violence in Gaza

For us as Israelis its very hard to call for a ceasefire right now Calling for a ceasefire is still seen as treason she says

Vardi also made a call to people around the world saying The only way to stop it is for the international community to intervene and not just say words and send statements and say that theyre very concerned about humanitarian consequences of Israels actions but to say we will not allow this including if it means cutting support to Israel until Israel agrees to a ceasefire

Do you think these climate solutions are achievable

Countries are falling behind on almost every policy required to cut greenhouse gas emissions a new report has found  a failure that makes the chances of keeping global heating below the critical climate thresholds even more remote

Scientists warned earlier this year that by 2027 the world is likely to reach temperatures 15C above preindustrial levels the target enshrined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement in order to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown

With action not being taken fast enough to pull the world back from the brink of climate devastation the State of Climate Action 2023 report has outlined the enormous acceleration in efforts required by the world to avoid increasingly dangerous and irreversible climate impacts including

 Phasing out coal seven times faster than is happening now
Reducing deforestation four times faster
Building public transport around the world six times faster

Examining all aspects of climate policy from governments across the world the report found that while some progress had been made with the uptake of green technology and electric vehicles all other progress  including the continuing public funding of fossil fuels  was woefully inadequate

Despite decades of dire warnings and wakeup calls our leaders have largely failed to mobilise climate action anywhere near the pace and scale needed said Sophie Boehm a research associate at the World Resources Institute and lead author of the report compiled by six climate thinktanks

Theres no time left to tinker at the edges Instead we need immediate transformational changes

A senior member of Benjamin Netanyahus government has said that Israel will no longer be able to accept the existence of Gaza and Palestinians there should agree to voluntary emigration and leave for other countries

Reuters reports that the finance minister Bezalel Smotrich who heads one of the religious nationalist parties in Netanyahus coalition was speaking after a call by two members of the Israeli parliament who wrote in a Wall Street Journal editorial that western countries should accept families from Gaza who expressed a desire to relocate

His comments underscore fears across the region that Israel wants to drive Palestinians out of Gaza repeating the mass dispossession of Palestinians when Israel was created in 1948 referred to as the Nakba

An estimated 15 million people in Gaza  threequarters of the blockaded territorys population  have fled their homes through the Israeli military safe routes in the six weeks of war

Earlier this week the Hamasrun health ministry said that at least 11240 Palestinians have been killed including 4630 children and 3130 women in Gaza by the Israeli military since 7 October About 1200 Israelis have died in the conflict most on 7 October

The picture above shows premature babies in Gazas largest hospital swaddled and laid down seven or eight to a bed in an effort to keep them warm and alive after oxygen supplies and power for their incubators ran out

Nurses attempted to provide what care they could for 39 babies who were transferred from the neonatal unit in another part of the complex after a strike on alShifa hospitals intensive care unit

I am afraid that all of the babies will lose their lives said Marwan Abu Sada the head of surgery at the hospital which was once considered the heart of Gazas healthcare system and is now operating under fire and without power clean water or food

Israel has said it is helping babies and others trapped inside the Gaza City hospital to evacuate but health officials and people trapped inside said fighting was continuing outside the facility

The last generator ran out of fuel at the weekend leading to the deaths of three premature babies and four other patients according to Gazas Hamasrun health ministry

Israels military said it had placed 300 litres of fuel near alShifa overnight for an emergency generator powering incubators for premature babies A health ministry spokesperson Ashraf alQidra told Al Jazeera the fuel would not be enough to operate the generator for an hour

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus the director general of the World Health Organization said on X that alShifa was not functioning as a hospital any more

The world cannot stand silent while hospitals which should be safe havens are transformed into scenes of death devastation and despair said Ghebreyesus

The Israel Defence Forces have repeatedly said that Hamas operates from bunkers underneath alShifa This is denied by Hamas and hospital staff

AlShifa is besieged no one can get out and no one can enter Abu Sada said

We are so afraid so scared of the bombardments But we must stay here we are ethically obliged to treat patients and we cannot leave with our patients still inside Even if we could where would we go

I want to be that voice of reason for the soldiers sent into yet another war

Ariel Bernstein was 20 years old when he first entered Gaza as a member of the Israel Defence Forces He says what he saw during the 2014 war and the destruction he left behind will forever haunt him

The war killed 2251 Palestinians more than half of them civilians according to UN figures and 74 Israelis including six civilians The intense fighting over 50 days also reduced swaths of Gaza to piles of rubble

Life in Gaza is unsustainable I have been astounded at how our society refuses to reflect on the situation in Gaza says Bernstein The 7 October massacre ignited a tribalist us versus them instinct among most of us leaving little space for complexity

Bernstein who is now a researcher for Israeli veterans antioccupation NGO breakingthesilenceisrael is calling for a political solution that offers hope for both Israelis and Palestinians

When the war ends and the firing stops we must realise it is not an end but just the beginning Both nations living on this land deserve a future of more than mutual destruction

We dont know when the bombing will stop but the children here still want to play

At a school hosting displaced families in Khan Younis southern Gaza the sound of singing and games drowns out the ambulance sirens

More than 4000 children have been killed according to Gazas health ministry and thousands more have lost their homes and had to flee since Israels bombardment of Gaza began four weeks ago

For those who have survived the psychological impact of the conflict is obvious

When the rockets strike the kids become hysterical says one parent Many now suffer from urinary incontinence night terrors and insomnia

The toll of conflict and the blockade on childrens mental health is too great says Jason Lee Save the Childrens country director for the occupied Palestinian territory We are running out of words to raise the alarm in strong enough terms or to articulate the scale of childrens suffering

Now volunteers such as aborjelaa spend their days going from school to school and offering these children a glimpse back into their childhood despite their losses

While it wont bring back their homes or loved ones volunteers are hoping that making time for play in a war zone will help these children recover from the trauma of living under siege

Its a new Nakba

After weeks of intense violence including home invasions and threats from Israeli settlers in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October entire villages on the south Hebron hills in the occupied West Bank have made a collective decision to leave

Armed settlers  some in reservist army uniforms some covering their faces  have begun breaking into their homes at night beating up adults destroying and stealing belongings and terrifying the children

Issa Ahmad Baghdad 71 has described this as a new Nakba referring to the expulsion of 700000 Palestinians in 1948 after the creation of Israel My family are going to Rafat But we dont know anyone there We dont know what to tell the children

Following decades of a desperate fight to cling on to their land the community has decided they have lost According to Israeli human rights group BTselem in the last three weeks 858 Palestinians from 32 different communities and 13 entire communities in total have been forcibly displaced The numbers increase every day

After years of legal battles Israels supreme court ruled last May in favour of the IDF that a 3000hectare 7410acre area of Masafer Yatta would remain a military training zone known as Firing Zone 918 a ruling illegal under international law and one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the occupation began Since then the army and Israeli settlers have steadily increased the pressure to try to force the Palestinian community in the Firing Zone as well as those living in dozens of nearby villages to leave

The worlds biggest fossil fuel firms are quietly planning scores of carbon bomb oil and gas projects that could destroy the last chance of stopping the planet heating to dangerous levels

Now the Guardian can reveal banks pumped more than 150bn last year into companies whose giant carbon bomb projects could drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limit of 15C with catastrophic global impacts

The carbon bombs  425 extraction projects that can each pump more than one gigaton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  cumulatively hold enough coal oil and gas to burn through the rapidly dwindling carbon budget four times over

Between 2016 and 2022 banks mainly in the US China and Europe gave 18tn in financing to the companies running them new research shows

The climate rhetoric did not match up with what was happening on the books said Shruti Shukla an energy campaigner at the National Resources Defense Council which was not involved in the investigation We need to rapidly decline our production of fossil fuels and support for fossil fuels whether thats regulatory or financial

When our environment team revealed the carbon bombs last year in an exclusive investigation scientists thought the remaining carbon budget to give a half chance of keeping global heating to 15C was about 500 gigatons of carbon dioxide But on Monday leading climate scientists published an update that put the figure at just 250 gigatons The carbon bombs could release more than 1000 gigatons over their lifetime

Benjamin Netanyahu has just spoken at a briefing where he described the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October as a turning point for leaders and nations

The Israeli prime minister speaking in English says it is time to decide if we are willing to fight for a future of hope and promise or surrender to tyranny and terror

Israel did not start this war but it will win this war he says Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory he says

He says he wants to make clear Israels position regarding a ceasefire in Gaza Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 911 Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7

Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas to surrender to terrorism to surrender to barbarism That will not happen

The Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war This is a time for war

Asked if Israel is inflicting collective punishment on the people of Palestine Benjamin Netanyahu says Hamas is preventing civilians in northern Gaza from leaving and forcing them into areas of conflict

Not a single civilian has to die the Israeli prime minister says 

He adds Were going out of our way to prevent civilian casualties not only by asking civilians to move calling them to move arranging a place for them to be which is safe also putting in humanitarian support providing them with the means with food with water with medicine

More than 8300 Palestinians have been killed in the bombardment in Gaza according to the Hamasrun health ministry More children have been killed in Gaza in the past three weeks than the total killed in conflicts around the world in every year since 2019 Save the Children said

A fresh wave of anguish swept the territory as communications returned for those with charged phones and news of friends and relatives killed since Friday arrived all at once

If the past three weeks were scary the coming ones would be brutally insane he says

The war in Gaza triggered by the Palestinian militant group Hamass massacre across southern Israel in which 1400 people were killed and another 230 kidnapped is now in its fourth week More than 8000 people in the tiny strip have been killed according to the Palestinian health ministry and the survivors have no safe place to go

I seek to put an end to these terrible shootings said Jared Golden the the Democratic representative of Maine

After a gunman killed 18 people in his constituency this week Golden said he was changing his stance on gun legislation and would now support banning assault weapons

At a news conference in Lewiston where the mass shooting occurred Golden said he had previously opposed a ban on what he described as deadly weapons of war out of fear for the lives of his family members

Announcing his new position Golden said he would work with any colleague to achieve gun legislation during his time left in Congress

The police search for a US army reservist suspected of carrying out a mass shooting in Maine has entered its second day

Newly released satellite images reveal how cities and towns in Gaza have been destroyed by almost three weeks of Israeli bombardments on the besieged enclave

Apartment buildings are crumpled and entire neighbourhoods lie in ruins in pictures taken before and after Israeli airstrikes and provided by Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs

In Beit Hanoun which lies close to the northern border with Israel four and fivestorey buildings are in various states of collapse Huge chunks are missing from some others are broken in half and two large complexes lie in piles of rubble

The city lies close to one of the main crossings through which Hamas militants launched their murderous rampage through southern Israel and has been a focus of much of the Israel Defence Forces IDF firepower

Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas which rules Gaza in retaliation for the 7 October attacks in which they killed more than 1400 people and took 229 people hostage

Since then Israel has continuously struck Gaza from the air imposed a siege and is preparing a ground invasion The Hamasrun health ministry says more than 7000 people many of them civilians have been killed in the Israeli bombardment

US president Joe Biden has questioned the reliability of the reporting of the death toll because the health ministry is run by Hamas

Omar Shakir the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch said Weve looked at satellite imagery Weve seen the number of buildings and the numbers that are coming out are in line with what we would expect with what were seeing on the ground So you put all those things together and were quite confident in the overall casualty numbers

Can you name these three Black British historical figures

If the answer is yes you are probably in the minority according to a new survey by Bloomsbury Publishing

While 75 of British adults surveyed acknowledged that they did not know very much or anything at all about the subject more than half could not recall any Black British historical figures at all

Although people with dark skin first came to Britain about 12000 years ago with the first known people to come directly from Africa settling approximately 2000 years ago more than a third of Britons surveyed believed that the first Black people migrated to Britain only in the past 200 years while one in four believed that it was within the past 100 years

I think disbelief is really the only word said Atinuke the author of Brilliant Black British History in response to the surveys findings

There have always been people with black and brown skin in Britain  from the stone age through every single era to the present day

More than that the forced contribution of millions of Black people before and during the Georgian era changed the course of British history  helping Britain to become the first industrialised nation in the world and a superpower

Atinuke has called for the government to drive more integration of Black British history in schools and universities noting that as our world becomes more polarised and divided increased inclusivity is needed now more than ever All British history needs to be taught as one history Its all our history

At least 49 Palestinians were killed in strikes that hit homes in Rafah and Khan Younis on Tuesday Gazas interior ministry said

And in the evening the Gaza health ministry which is run by Hamas said 471 Palestinian were killed in a massive explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City It was the biggest single loss of life in the blockaded territory in all the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007

Officials in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike Israel has denied it was involved and released video audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a missile misfire by Palestinian Islamic Jihad another militant group operating in Gaza The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim and the scale of the blast appeared to be outside the militant groups capabilities

The bombardment on Gaza has continued without relenting since Hamas launched its surprise attack on southern Israel 12 days ago which killed more than 1300 Israelis

Australia has overwhelmingly voted no to recognising Indigenous people in its constitution and enshrining a First Nations voice to parliament on matters that affect them

Saturdays voice to parliament referendum failed with the defeat becoming clear shortly after polls closed

To succeed the yes campaign  advocating for the change  needed to secure a double majority meaning it needed a majority of the national vote as well as majorities in four of Australias six states

The defeat will be seen by Indigenous advocates as a blow to what has been a hardfought struggle to make progress on reconciliation and recognition in modern Australia with First Nations people continuing to suffer discrimination and poorer health and economic outcomes

More than 17 million Australians were enrolled for the compulsory vote with many emigrants visiting embassies around the world in the weeks leading up to Saturdays poll

The majority of the US wants this

On a 17acre site in Phoenix Arizona that once contained a car body shop and some largely derelict buildings an unusual experiment has emerged that invites Americans to live in a way that is rare outside of their fleeting experiences of college or trips to Europe a walkable community devoid of cars

Culdesac ushered in its first 36 residents earlier this year and will eventually house around 1000 people when the full 760 units arranged in two and threestory buildings are completed by 2025

Neighborhoods of this ilk are often prohibitively expensive However the 170m Culdesac project shows we can build walkable neighborhoods successfully in the US in the 2020s according to Ryan Johnson the 40yearold who cofounded the community with Jeff Berens a former McKinsey consultant

Over the past century huge highways have been plowed through the heart of US cities These roads have primarily served a sprawling suburbia composed almost entirely of singlefamily homes with spacious back yards where car driving is often the only option to get anywhere

The result is a nation in which we are all ruthlessly separated from most of our daily needs and also from each other Jeff Speck a city planner and urban designer said
Culdesac can be seen then as not only a model for a more climatefriendly community but as a way of somehow stitching back together communities that have become physically socially and politically riven lacking a third place to congregate other than dislocated homes and workplaces

Johnson said he is planning to bring the concept to other cities This is something that the majority of the US wants so they can work all over the country he said

Have you seen a bedbug yet

Bedbug panic has swept across Paris and is making its way over the channel to London  after videos of the insects infesting both cities went viral

But do we actually need to worry about it

Some experts however are saying that the problem isnt new and that the amount of bedbugs in London has been growing year on year

David Cain a microbiologist whos been exterminating the bed bugs for two decades explains they were incredibly common in the early 20th century but because of powerful insecticide used a lot during and after the second world war rates of infestations fell dramatically around the world

For decades bedbugs were thought to be a thing of the past  they became so rare that people could no longer identify them and pestcontrol professionals werent equipped to fight them

But since the early 2000s they have returned  thanks to regular international travel increasing immunity to insecticides warmer climates and overcrowded living conditions

Dozens of current and former Amazon workers have claimed unfair practices by the brand and labor agents involved in their employment

The accusations include abusive working and living conditions restrictions on movement and false promises about wages working conditions and the identity of the employer

The workers accounts provide insight into how major US corporations profit directly or indirectly from employment practices that may amount to labor trafficking which is defined as using force coercion or fraud to induce someone to work or provide service

Fortyeight of the 54 Nepali workers interviewed by the Guardian say recruiters misled them about the terms of their employment falsely promising they would work directly for Amazon

During their time in Saudi Arabia these workers say they were paid a fraction of what direct hires for Amazons Saudi warehouses earn because labor supply firms were taking big cuts of what Amazon was paying for their labor

Some say that after theyd been laid off from work at Amazon their labor supply company sought to squeeze more money out of them taking advantage of Saudi laws that give employers broad powers to control foreign workers freedom of movement

One such worker is Momtaj Mansur After he lost his Amazon job he was given the choice of staying in a place he describes as like a hell or pushing his family back in Nepal deeper into destitution by paying a 1300 exit fee

I told them either kill us or send us home but dont give us so much pain he says

A current Amazon worker said We have already paid money to come here and we have to pay additional money to return We feel trapped

In a written reply to questions for this story Amazon acknowledged that some workers at its Saudi facilities had been mistreated It said it will make sure that workers who paid recruiting fees get their money back and it was implementing stronger controls to ensure similar incidents do not occur and to raise overall standards for workers in the region

The way we raise kids and the information we expose them to helps to shape the people they become says author Nic Stone

She wrote her book Dear Martin  a young adult novel about police brutality and racism in the US  because she said she felt it was painfully necessary to give it to her sons 

Then dozens of schools across the country started to ban the book

Over the last school year book bans in US public schools have increased by 33 particularly in states like Florida according to a study by the nonprofit Pen America

The authors whose books were targeted were most frequently female people of colour andor LGBTQ individuals the report  which coincided with the American Library Associations annual Banned Books Week  also found

The Bibby Stockholm the barge that the Home Office wants to use to accommodate 500 of the more than 100000 asylum seekers currently in the UK has been plagued by controversy from the beginning

With cabins the size of a prison cell the vessel would house people in detentionlike conditions campaigners say The NGO One Life to Live has described it as a floating Grenfell due to the risk of fire

But the barge has been empty since 11 August when asylum seekers who had been onboard for just four days were evacuated after the discovery of deadly legionella bacteria

Those who were moved back into hotels said they could not cope with the living conditions They said they were scared about their health stressed and were struggling mentally

So far ministers havent kept their promise to reduce the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by speeding up applications and bringing in the use of cheaper accommodation such as barges

More than 175000 people were waiting for a decision on whether they would be granted refugee status at the end of June up 44 from last year And in the meantime the cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels has risen to 8m a day

A Home Office spokesperson has said The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority and we are working closely with external partners and Dorset and Wiltshire fire service to further improve safety measures on the vessel

Time doesnt heal you All that time does is give you the strength to manage it better

It was late June in 2015 when tourism lecturer Suzanne Richards arrived home after a class The house was quiet because the previous evening she had waved her teenage sons Owen and Joel off on a jolly boys outing to Tunisia with her brother Adrian and her father Pat

An unknown number flashed up on my phone Normally I wouldnt answer but for some reason I did she recalls And that was when I heard Owen screaming Theres a gunman and theyre all dead He was so distressed that I initially couldnt tell which son was speaking Then we were cut off

She immediately called the number back but couldnt get through Messages started pinging from friends and family asking if she had seen the news

A terrorist had entered the Hotel Imperial Marhaba via the pool area and started firing at people Among the gunmans 38 victims were Joel Adrian and Pat

Eight years on she remembers that terrible day and the sense of purpose she found in the aftermath

Its a cliche maybe but Ive realised that life is short and you only get one chance at it

Still she says I ask myself every day why did it happen What has the shooter gained from doing that apart from ripping 38 families apart I dont get it and I never will get it

Although they had counseling Suzanne says both she and Owen believe you have to learn to manage loss yourself adding I live for the fact that Im going to see them again

If I knew that I wasnt going to see them again that would be a struggle so I choose to live with the fact that I will I really hope that they are watching us and everything we are doing

Nobody who left will go back said Rima who fled NagornoKarabakh with her family after Azerbaijani forces launched a 24hour blitz on the disputed region on 19 September

Rima is one of thousands of ethnic Armenians who have left their homes over the last few days in an attempt to reach the border town of Goris

Many of those aiming to cross into Armenia via the Lachin corridor which has been blocked for 10 months by Azerbaijani forces have already been forced from their homes in past conflicts 

Approximately 42500 people  about 35 of NagornoKarabakhs population  are thought to have fled so far But it is expected that number could swell to up to 120000 people

The prospects of the world staying within the 15C limit on global heating have brightened owing to the staggering growth of renewable energy and green investment in the past two years the chief of the worlds energy watchdog has said

The 15C limit stems from the Paris agreement which contains two key goals of limiting global heating to well below 2C while pursuing efforts to limit temperature rises to 15C above preindustrial levels

Fatih Birol the executive director of the International Energy Agency and the worlds foremost energy economist said much more needed to be done but that the rapid uptake of solar power and electric vehicles were encouraging in meeting this goal

Despite the scale of the challenges I feel more optimistic than I felt two years ago he said in an interview Clean energy investments in the last two years have seen a staggering 40 increase

Due to solar and electric vehicle sales staying in line with what they should be Birol said the world is on track to reach net zero by 2050

But Birol also noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector were still stubbornly high and that the extreme weather seen around the world this year had shown the climate was already changing at frightening speed

This is Aditi Shankar and shes received the UKs first rejection free kidney  and it was given by her mum

In a pioneering treatment eightyearold Aditi has been spared from taking lifelong drugs to stop her body rejecting her kidney transplant

Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital say the breakthrough was made possible by reprogramming Aditi Shankars immune system with stem cells before giving her the new kidney

Because the bone marrow transplant and kidney came from the same donor  her mother  the new kidney is working without the need for drugs that stop the body from rejecting a donated organ

Aditi is nowable to swim sing dance and play on her trampoline

My mum gave me my new blood cells said Aditi I got the kidney transplant when I went to special sleep and closed my eyes Now I have got the line out I can go swimming

Aditis favourite class in school is science and she has a keen interest in biology after learning so much about the human body during her time in hospital

Her father Uday 48 said Most of the support for the family has come from Aditi She was going in for six to eight hours a day of dialysis and then she would come home and still light the whole house up

It has been more than a week since a devastating flood hit Libya killing thousands of people and destroying entire neighbourhoods

Entire districts of the city of Derna with an estimated population of at least 120000 were swept away or buried in brown mud after two dams south of the city broke unleashing torrents of flood water down a usually dry riverbed

State media said at least 891 buildings had been destroyed in the city whose mayor has said 20000 people may have died

Protests broke out in Derna on Monday with hundreds venting their anger against authorities and demanding accountability

The devastated citys internet and mobile networks have been switched off according to reports while local and foreign journalists have been instructed by the eastern Libyan authorities to leave

More than 10000 are missing according to the Libyan Red Crescent as desperate rescue efforts continue in an attempt to find any remaining survivors and bodies continue to wash up on the shoreline

The size of a small police force

The Metropolitan police  Britains biggest force  has revealed that around 1061 out of its 34000 officers are suspended or on restricted duties according to its latest figures about disciplinary processes

Thats equivalent to the size of Warwickshire or Wiltshire police forces for those who know Englands counties well

An overhaul of culture and standards within the Met prompted by the crimes of serial rapist David Carrick and Wayne Couzens who was convicted of the kidnap rape and murder of Sarah Everard has led to 100 dismissals for gross misconduct in the last 12 months a 66 increase on historical averages the force said

But it will take two or more years to root out those who are corrupting policing said the Mets deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Cundy who has been leading the reforms

He added that a paradox in the process meant the harder they worked the more cases of misconduct and possible criminality would be uncovered

Since the conviction of Carrick a serving officer unmasked as one of the worst serial sex offenders in the UK 1600 cases have been identified where officers had faced allegations of domestic or sexual violence over the past 10 years but no action was taken

There are about 450 investigations into the cases that were reviewed and the most serious of all the cases reviewed involved rape allegations

They want to erase women from society

This is how one student has described Irans new chastity and hijab bill which is awaiting approval by authorities Under the draft law women face up to 10 years in prison if they continue to defy the countrys mandatory hijab law

The stricter dress code which amounts to gender apartheid UN experts said comes exactly one year after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini The 22yearold was allegedly beaten by police for wearing the Islamic headscarf incorrectly 

Her death on 16 September led to the largest wave of popular unrest for years in Iran and a brutal crackdown by security services in response with hundreds of men women and children killed and thousands more injured according to human rights groups

Now the proposed legislation threatens to silence women even more by classifying the failure to wear a headscarf as a more severe offence punishable with the same jail time as murders or drug traffickers says Hossein Raeesi an Iranian human rights lawyer Thats ridiculous to even think about

Concerned activists have said the regimes new law would weaponise public morals denying women and girls their freedom of expression Some women have said they fear their lives will become an open prison But will this stop them from risking their lives and protesting against Irans oppressive regime Many think not 

Journalist Deepa Parent explains the Islamic Republics plans  and how they hope to silence women across Iran

What do you think about American XL bullies

The dog breed is set become the first breed to be banned in the UK since the introduction of the Dangerous Dogs Act in 1991 prime minister Rishi Sunak announced today after a series of attacks

Sunak says the dogs are a danger to our communities and he had asked ministers to work with police and experts to define the breed  American XL bully dogs currently are a breed defined in law  with a view to outlawing it by the end of the year

The campaigner Emma Whitfield whose 10yearold son Jack Lis was killed by an XL bully in south Wales in 2021 said in response to the announcement Im sobbing Im sat on my own sobbing I dont even have words right now

However the announcement has been met with mixed reactions The Dog Control Coalition said The view of all leading animal charities is that the solution is not banning more types

Instead the government needs to focus on the improvement and enforcement of current breeding and dog control regulations and on promoting responsible dog ownership and training

But how dangerous is this breed And is banning them the right move Watch our science reporter Madeleine Finlay explain

These are the chilling words Libyan poet Mustafa alTrabelsi wrote on his Facebook page before he died in the catastrophic floods that have killed tens of thousands of people in his country

On the night of the deadly storm in at 744pm Mustafa wrote on his Facebook page The scenes are scary and things may escalate to a disaster and we are under the rule of a corrupt tyrant who has nothing but data claiming to be prepared and in fact does not have any equipment and rescue teams are only few

May God help the families all over our beloved country

Officials in the port city of Derna including the mayor Abdulmenam alGhaithi believe 20000 people may have died At least 5500 people have been confirmed dead

Footage on social media showed the terror of late Sunday night as children and women scrambled in the darkness with phone torchlights to climb stairs to higher floors away from the raging water

One man described how the foundations of buildings seven floors high were uprooted within seconds as if a tornado had hit them sending them into the sea

Khaled Mattawa a Libyan writer who translated Mustafas poem said the response and the generosity across Libya had been heartbreaking people in Misrata offering apartments a mechanic in Sebha offering free tyres and repairs for those heading to help in Derna a woman offering to adopt babies recent mothers offering to breastfeed foundlings and orphans All incredible acts of generosity but he said ultimately all futile

Im trying not to cry thinking about it to be honest said Patsy Stevenson pictured above being pinned to the floor by officers as she was arrested in a nowinfamous photo that sparked widespread fury at the Met police

But I dont believe the apology marks any real change  The vigil itself should have been a moment where the Met decided to change things and hold themselves accountable

Scotland Yard has apologised and paid substantial damages to Patsy Stevenson and Dania AlObeid who were arrested during a vigil for Sarah Everard Everard was kidnapped raped and murdered by a serving Met police officer in March 2021 when Covid restrictions were in place

The force acknowledged that it was understandable that Patsy Stevenson and Dania AlObeid had wanted to attend a candlelit vigil at Clapham Common because they felt women had been badly let down

This payout represents a major climbdown following years of legal battles over the policing of the event The Mets actions at the vigil saw it and its then commissioner Cressida Dick widely criticised

I will continue speaking out about the abuse that goes on in police forces said AlObeid who was handcuffed and arrested at the vigil She discovered that she had been convicted behind closed doors under the Single Justice Procedure SJP only after being contacted by the media

They have both overcome significant adversities in their attempts to hold the Met police accountable and in full public view I hope other women particularly survivors of physical and sexual violence will feel strengthened in their efforts to do the same said Rachel Harger a solicitor at Bindmans LLP who represented Stevenson and AlObeid

But after President Bashar alAssad cut fuel subsidies driving up the cost of living people took to the streets to denounce his policies in a country where the economy was already battered by high inflation and the civil war

As protests spread across the south of Syria demonstrators in Suwayda and surrounding areas have become bolder in calling for Assad to go Some have been seen pulling down posters of the president on the streets of their city Others in the town of Melh in the east of Suwayda province welded shut the doors of the ruling Baath party

Assad has been enjoying renewed international diplomatic support and is keen to be recognised as the victor in the conflict In May he was seen attending an Arab League summit in Jeddah for the first time since Syria was suspended over a crackdown on antigovernment protests in 2011 which helped spark the countrys civil war

In this video Asmaa alOmar a journalist based in Istanbul argues Assads problems are far from over if frustration over his handling of the country and economy continues to grow

Mexicos supreme court has decriminalized abortion across the country two years after ruling that abortion was not a crime in one northern state

That earlier ruling had set off a grinding process of decriminalizing abortion state by state Last week the central state of Aguascalientes became the 12th state to decriminalize the procedure

The courts decision is part of a growing trend across Latin America and is in stark contrast to the nationwide rollback of reproductive rights currently underway in the US

Mexico City was the first Mexican jurisdiction to decriminalize abortion 15 years ago

An undercover police officer used his fake identity to deceive a woman into a 19year relationship in which they became partners and had a child together the Guardian can reveal The officer concealed his real identity from the woman for the duration of that period never telling her his real occupation and using his fictitious identity on the birth certificate of their son

In 2020 after the couple were engaged to be married the woman discovered that her fiance whom she believed to be a businessman was in fact a police officer who had subjected her to a sophisticated deception lasting almost two decades

The Independent Office for Police Conduct IOPC is investigating senior officers at Avon and Somerset police who knew about the undercover officers relationship with the woman as far back as 2013

They appear to have waited at least seven years before informing the woman that the person she knew as her fiance had been using a fake identity given to him for use in covert police operations In a statement the IOPC confirmed it was investigating the case

Mary and her family have for the last three years wrestled with how to respond to such devastating news Her siblings say that Avon and Somerset police have consistently put pressure on them not to speak publicly about the relationship warning of the risk of social unrest if the news got out

Avon and Somerset police did not respond to repeated requests for comment prior to publication However on Wednesday the force issued an apology
 
A spokesperson said  We fully recognise for those involved it has been deeply upsetting over a number of years and remains so today We are sorry We recognise and understand the devastating and appalling impact this has had on all those affected and we have taken and continue to take our duty of care to them extremely seriously

We are in a moment of generational change

Alexandria OcasioCortez who at 29 became the youngest woman and youngest Latina to serve in the House of Representatives is now 33 twice reelected and comfortable in her political skin

She could hardly be described as an old hand but nor does she channel the shock of the new

She deploys social media with enviable authenticity she grills congressional witnesses like a seasoned interrogator she is an object of perverse fascination for Fox News and rightwing trolls she has been around Washington long enough to draw charges of cooption and selling out

OcasioCortez who recently sat down for an interview with the Guardian is clearly aware of this eternal dilemma that can beset the left  purity versus pragmatism  and is determined to navigate it with care

She makes clear that Biden cannot take progressives for granted next year but urges Democrats to unite against the bigger threat facing America

We are not in 2020 and seeing what that turnout may look like is something that Im sure keeps many of us up at night she says But that being said I know that this is why to me support of President Biden has been very important because this question is larger than any policy differences This is truly about having a strong front against fascism in the United States

She also sees hope in how people have responded to the allout attack on reproductive rights by Republicans and the supreme court Young women especially I think have been very animated and organised in this moment I think we are in a moment of generational change

Overtourism has long been a problem across the worlds travel hotspots  but now besieged cities are starting to fight back

In the 20 years running up to Covid international tourism doubled to 24 billion arrivals in 2019 Overall tourism last year was at 63 of its preCovid levels Numbers this year are expected to be almost exactly as they were four years ago 385 million

Every location has a different challenge with tourists On Catalan beaches it may be that they are wearing too many clothes in Barcelona there are simply too many people Whether that turns the entire place into a giant hotel or a human trafficjam it is impossible to imagine that being a pleasant livable experience for the host citizens

Jon Henley the Guardians Europe correspondent based in Paris says wherever youve got a medieval city centre those become unbearable

Meanwhile Amsterdam is at the vanguard of the growing stayaway movement The city council decided this summer to close the cruise ship terminal in the city centre specifically citing its sustainability goals and has actively discouraged young British men who want a messy weekend from visiting

This is how Olivia Rodrigo described her feelings towards the expectations and double standards that she feels bound by

In an interview with our deputy music editor Laura Snapes oliviarodrigo said she was proud that when her album Sour was released it contained the kind of messy emotions that young women arent meant to exhibit

Ive experienced a lot of emotional turmoil over having all these feelings  that I felt like I couldnt express especially in my job Rodrigo said

Ive always felt like you can never admit it be so grateful all the time so many people want this position And that causes a lot of repressed feelings

Now on her second album Rodrigo is trying to make sense of her extraordinary young life but when asked about the highlights she says that moment at Glastonbury 2022 with Lily Allen still stands out

The Spanish football federations regional presidents have demanded that Luis Rubiales immediately resign pulling support for the football chief days after its members heartily applauded his vow to stay on

More than a week after Spanish footballs most powerful executive grabbed forward Jenni Hermoso by the head and planted a kiss on her lips the federations regional presidents were summoned to an extraordinary and urgent meeting in Madrid on Monday to assess the impact of the crisis

Six hours later they emerged publishing a unanimous joint statement After the latest events and the unacceptable behaviours that have seriously damaged the image of Spanish football we request that Mr Luis Rubiales immediately present his resignation as president of the Spanish football federation

The demand was a seeming reversal from the scene that had played out at the federations meeting on Friday where Rubiales 46 repeated I will not resign five times to vigorous applause from the members in attendance His speech which railed at fake feminism was met with a standing ovation

Rubiales has sought to portray the kiss as consensual claiming he had asked Hermoso if he could give her a peck and that she had replied OK jennihermoso later rejected any suggestion that the kiss was consensual She described Rubialess words as categorically false

She said the situation had left her feeling vulnerable and a victim of aggression In her statement she described the kiss as an impulsive act sexist out of place and without any type of consent from my part In short I wasnt respected

In the fallout from the incident all 23 players who won the World Cup have agreed that they would not play for Spain until there was change  and here are three ways their fellow footballers and their supporters have stood behind them To read more  including former England international neetz2s latest sportsblog on why Rubiales is a sad symbol of much bigger problems for womens football  tap the link in bio

If I am destined to sacrifice myself for the love of my homeland I will gladly accept it

In July Finn Lau a prodemocracy activist from Hong Kong living in exile in London woke up to urgent messages from friends

Finn was told that he and seven other overseas activists had HK1m bounties out for their arrest Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said these dissidents would be pursued to the ends of the Earth 

Just days after the announcement officers began showing up at the homes of many of the activists families in Hong Kong taking away parents siblings children and inlaws for questioning

Finn said he was not surprised

In 2019 he was a leading figure in Hong Kongs mass protests where an estimated quarter of the regions population took to the streets against what they described as an erosion of Hong Kongs freedom from Beijing control 

For years he has been wanted by Hong Kong police

Now faced with what he says is increased international oppression from China even in the UK Finn no longer feels safe

Ivy Snitzer was Gwyneth Paltrows body double for the role of Rosemary in 2001s Shallow Hal

At the time 20yearold Snitzer was a Los Angelesbased acting student with aspirations to become an actor or comedian Mostly I just wanted to be funny she says

Snitzer has zero negative memories of shooting the movie The cast and crew treated me like I really mattered she says like they couldnt make the movie without me Snitzer was made to feel really comfortable when her body was being filmed

However as she promoted the movies release with TV and magazine interviews she soon realized that strangers took her moment in the spotlight as an open invitation to approach her on the street

Many were angry that Snitzer had said It is not the worst thing in the world to be fat some claimed she was promoting obesity 

One person found her address and sent her diet pills There were love letters too  someone mailed her a symphony they had composed especially for her

I got really scared she says I was like maybe Im done with the concept of fame maybe I dont want to be an actor Maybe Ill do something else

Less than two years after Shallow Hal was released Snitzer says she was technically starving to death In 2003 she had gastric band surgery which reduced the size of her stomach and restricted what she could eat But shortly after the procedure the band slipped

I was so thin you could see my teeth through my face and my skin was all grey she says Humans shouldnt have to experience how very bleak that particular time in my life was

However 22 years after appearing in Shallow Hal Snitzer is still coming to terms with its impact on her life

How bad it gets is still up to us

These are the words Dr Jeremy Wilkinson a sea ice physicist at the British Antarctic Survey after new research was published on the catastrophic dieoff of emperor penguin chicks in Antarctica

Thousands of the small animals across four colonies in the region are believed to have died because of recordlow sea ice levels that caused a breeding failure in late 2022

Analysis of satellite images showed the breakup of usually stable sea ice and the disappearance of the colonies at a time when chicks had not yet grown their waterproof feathers

The breeding failures in the Bellingshausen Sea were without precedent the research said as it was the first time multiple colonies across a large region had all failed in a single season

About 30 of the known 62 emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica have been affected by partial or total sea ice loss since 2018

Emperor penguins are unusual in that they have not come under pressure from hunting fishing or loss of habitat

Global heating is considered their main longterm threat with projections that by 2100 about 90 of colonies could be so small that they are essentially extinct

Yevgeny Prigozhin the Wagner paramilitary chief who launched an armed mutiny in June was on a private jet that crashed in the Tver region near Moscow killing all 10 onboard Russian officials have said

Rosaviatsia the Russian aviation authority said Prigozhin was one of the passengers listed in the manifest as being onboard the Embraer business jet that crashed on Wednesday evening

The cause of the crash was not immediately clear but Prigozhins longstanding feud with the military and the armed uprising he led in June would give the Russian state ample motive for revenge 

Media channels linked to Wagner quickly suggested that a Russian air defence missile had shot down the plane

The Embraer jet crashed in the Tver region while flying between Moscow and St Petersburg 

Video posted to the internet apparently showed the small jet trailing a plume of smoke before slamming into the ground and erupting in flames

Several Russian news agencies including Baza which is close to Russian law enforcement said the seven passengers and three crew onboard the jet were all killed Officials later confirmed 10 people had died in the crash

Prigozhin released a video earlier this week in which he claimed to be in Africa where his mercenaries have relocated since the abortive uprising 

But it was unclear when it was taken and if he had returned to Russia since it was shot

Transatlantic chattel slavery is  without parallel for its brutality without parallel for its length over 400 years without parallel for its profitability

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian Patrick Robinson a leading judge at the international court of justice has said the UK will no longer be able to ignore the growing calls for reparation for transatlantic slavery

In April the prime minister Rishi Sunak refused to apologise for Britains role in the slave trade or to commit to paying reparations

They cannot continue to ignore the greatest atrocity signifying mans inhumanity to man Robinson said ahead of Unescos Day for Remembering the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Abolition

Robinson who was born in Sheffield Jamaica in 1944 was involved in compiling what has been described as the most comprehensive statetostate reparations analysis ever conducted

It concluded that the UK alone is required to pay a sum of 24tn 188tn as reparations for transatlantic slavery in 14 countries Of that sum about 96tn is due to Jamaica

Reparations have never been paid So the calculations begin from day one of transatlantic chattel slavery that is hundreds of years and that alone explains the high figures Robinson when asked if they came as a surprise

Robinson who presided over the trial of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Miloevi said the international tide on slavery reparations was quickly shifting and urged the UK to change its position on the issue

I see it as a kind of service for the descendants of the enslaved not only in Jamaica and the Caribbean but wherever transatlantic chattel slavery was carried out

On each of the worlds tallest animals there is a unique pattern of patches which researchers believe are inherited from their mother  They act as a form of camouflage in the wild and the skin under the spots also has a system of blood vessels that allows them to release heat through the center of each patch  a form of thermal regulation

Except with this Tennessee newcomer 

The female giraffe born on 31 July is a uniform brown color and is thought to be the worlds only singularly colored and spotless giraffe
And now Brights zoo have announced a contest for the public to name the almost onemonthold animal who is already 6ft tall

This was what was said in one victim impact statement before Lucy Letby the countrys most prolific child serial killer in modern history was told she will spend the rest of her life in prison

Letby a neonatal nurse was sentenced on Monday for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six more at the Countess of Chester hospital She is only the third woman in the UK to be given a wholelife term

This was a cruel calculated and cynical campaign of child murder involving the smallest and most vulnerable of children said the judge Justice James Goss KC as he delivered the sentence at Manchester crown court

Letby refused to return to court to hear her sentence passed leading to calls to begin legally requiring convicts to face their sentencing hearings in person

The court in Letbys absence heard heartrending impact statements from the many victims of Letbys crimes before the sentence was pronounced

It was a living nightmare said the mother of twin boys one of whom was murdered and one survived insulin poisoning the following day Our world shattered when we encountered evil disguised as a caring nurse

We wanted justice and that day has come said the mother of a twodayold girl who was murdered by Letby

If you look across the world Maui is literally on fire  I dont know if my ancestral land will still be there if I have children

This is what author and climate activist Mikaela Loach said as she staged a walkout of her own book talk alongside two authors at this years Edinburgh International Book Festival

Why They were protesting the festivals sponsors links to fossil fuel companies specifically their main sponsor investment company Baillie Gifford

The festival has already come under fire for their sponsors with more than 100 authors sending an open letter this week calling on the event to drop any backers that invest in fossil fuels Climate activist Greta Thunberg also said that she was cancelling her scheduled appearance at the festival accusing Baillie Gifford of greenwashing

The Guardian has contacted Baillie Gifford and the festival for comment

A representative from Baillie Gifford previously said that the firm has nothing further to add to the statement that it issued in response to Thunbergs withdrawal In that statement Nick Thomas a partner at Baillie Gifford said the company is not a significant fossil fuel investor

The company said in a previous briefing that only 2 of its clients money is invested in companies with more than 5 of their revenue coming from fossil fuel activities compared with the market average of 11 It also noted that it invested more than double the proportion of clients money in companies dedicated to clean energy solutions It also disputes that 5bn has been invested in fossil fuel companies

In response to the letter last week the festivals director Nick Barley thanked the authors and asked for time to consider their points He said they had looked carefully at the firm before using them and concluded that they were investing more in green energy

In the video mikaelaloach and mtonsy explain why they staged their protest

Good people of Georgia it was never our intention to offend anyone the group later wrote in a statement We have a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play drums and it seemed from the stage that the initial response from the crowd indicated that they were okay with tonights audience participation member

As fires rage in the west fueled by fossil fuel pollution todays ruling in Montana is a gamechanger that marks a turning point in this generations efforts to save the planet from the devastating effects of humancaused climate chaos

This is what Julia Olson founder of nonprofit law firm Our Childrens Trust said on Monday after youth activists won the first constitutional climate trial in US history in what leading US environmental lawyer Michael Gerrard called the strongest decision on climate change ever issued by any court

Im so speechless right now Eva a plaintiff who was 14 when the suit was filed said in a statement Im really just excited and elated and thrilled

Sixteen young people aged five to 22 sued the state of Montana earlier this year in the first youthled climate case to make it to trial accusing the state governments profossil fuel policies of contributing to climate change and violating their right to a healthy environment

This is a huge win for Montana for youth for democracy and for our climate said Olson whose nonprofit law firm Our Childrens Trust brought the suit alongside Western Environmental Law Center and McGarvey Law

Youthled constitutional climate lawsuits brought by Our Childrens Trust are also pending in four other states One of those cases brought by Hawaii youth plaintiffs is set to go to trial in June 2024 attorneys announced last week

The case in Montana is a clear sign that seeking climate justice through the courts is a viable and powerful strategy said Delta Merner lead scientist at the Science Hub for Climate Litigation at the Union of Concerned Scientists

To house any human being in a quasi floating prison like the Bibby Stockholm is inhumane To try to do so to this group of people is unbelievably cruel said Steve Smith chief executive of the refugee charity Care4Calais

The Green partys spokesperson on migration and refugees Benali Hamdache told LBC radio the decision was an expensive way to be cruel as the first 15 asylum seekers were moved on to the Bibby Stockholm barge

Lawyers say they are intervening to halt the transfer of dozens more onto the floating accommodation claiming the vessel is unsafe and unsuitable for traumatised people

The Bibby Stockholms use comes as the Home Office fulfilled Rishi Sunaks promise to use barges and former military bases to accommodate some asylum seekers after the cost of housing them in hotels rose to 19bn last year

However the move has been condemned by refugee organisations as costly cruel and inhumane

An asylum seeker who was jailed in Iran for his human rights campaigning told the Guardian he has not been able to sleep since receiving a notice that he is being moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge and said it would be another jail for him

Sarah Dines the minister for safeguarding told BBC Radio 4s Today programme that while only a small number of asylum seekers were expected to be housed on the barge which has 222 cabins at first it could increase rapidly to its capacity

Pressed on whether all of them could be onboard by the end of the week Dines said Yes quite possibly it will be 500 We are hoping

She said the increase in the number of people on the ship would be gradual despite concerns from the Fire Brigades Union that the vessel was a deathtrap

In Brazil there are at least glimmers of hope writes our global environment editor Jonathan Watts

In June the government celebrated a 34 fall in Amazon deforestation rates since Luiz Incio Lula da Silva was elected president at the start of the year Now the figures for July are on course to be even better the environment minister Marina Silva has told the Guardian there has been decrease of more than 60 compared with the same month last year

The exact figure which is based on the Deter satellite alert system will be released in the coming days But independent analysts described the preliminary data as incredible and said the improvement compared with the same month last year could be the best since 2005

The rapid progress highlights the importance of political change A year ago under the farright then president Jair Bolsonaro the Amazon was suffering one of the worst cutting and burning seasons in recent history

Bolsonaro has been accused of annihilating environmental policy which has had a severe impact on Brazils indigenous population like the Yanomami people

Since a new administration led by Luiz Incio Lula da Silva took power at the start of the year the government has penalised land grabbers mounted paramilitary operations to drive out illegal miners demarcated more indigenous land and created more conservation areas

However as Watts explains Brazils agribusinessdominated Congress has undermined the chances of future gains by gutting the authority of the environment ministry and the lower house passed a bill to limit recognition of Indigenous lands These contradictory signals are not conducive to growth  ecological or economic

Unlike Donald Trumps first two indictments the former presidents third set of criminal charges stands out as the first major legal effort to hold him accountable for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election

Prosecutors said that for two months after his election loss Trump spread lies to create an intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger and erode public faith in the administration of the election

They cited an example in Georgia where Trump claimed more than 10000 dead people voted in four days even after the states top elections official told him that was not true

Trump is bidding to regain the White House in 2024 and currently leads in polling for the Republican presidential nomination by a substantial majority He called the case ridiculous

Niger which was considered a stable country in an unstable region has been grappling with the fallout of a military coup that has been widely condemned by the international community

Last Wednesday the west African countrys presidential guard a group that is supposed to protect the democratically elected leader blockaded the presidential palace Soldiers appeared on state TV to announce they had removed President Mohamed Bazoum from power seized control of the government and suspended the constitution

Bazoums election in 2021 was the first democratic transition of power in a country that has witnessed four military coups since independence from France in 1960

Anticoup and counter protests erupted in the normally peaceful capital Niamey but the military acted quickly and violently to quell dissent A nationwide curfew was announced and the borders were closed

France has said it will begin evacuating its citizens and other Europeans from the country Tensions between Niger and its former colonial power have escalated since the coup Bazoum was one of the last prowestern leaders in Africas Sahel region which has faced jihadist insurgencies

These latest developments have been a bitter blow for western countries particularly France and the US who for a decade have viewed Niger as a reliable partner because of the relative stability it held in a region marred by terrorism violence and coups

The situation is further complicated by Nigers geopolitical importance to the west and Russias looming presence in the surrounding region

Queer artist bones tan jones has criticised the 1975s frontman Matty Healy for kissing his male bandmate on stage at Good Vibes festival in Malaysia

Authorities cancelled the remainder of the threeday festival with many people fearing a festival of this size wont be allowed in the country for a while

Queer people in Malaysia cant kiss someone of the same sex without risking being fined or flogged so why can Matty Healy says jones

The musicians and workers involved in the festival are now preparing a lawsuit against Matty Healy and the 1975 to seek damages from the cancellation

And yayabones believes that Matty Healys actions has made the situation worse for the Malaysian LGBTQ community rather than better

In Malaysia there are no LGBTQ rights with a penalty of up to 20 years in prison for sodomy and Global Trans Rights Index ranks Malaysia as the second worst country in the world for transgender rights

jones says they wish Healy had donated to the grassroots organisations that fight for LGBTQ rights in Malaysia like Justice for Sisters who raise awareness about violence and persecution towards Mak Nyah transgender women in Malaysia

To Healy and his fans if you want to actually help LGBTQ people in Malaysia please consider funding the aforementioned organisations

The air is unbreathable the heat is unbearable and the level of fossil fuel profits and climate inaction is unacceptable Leaders must lead No more hesitancy no more excuses no more waiting for others to move first There is simply no more time for that

These are the words of the UN secretary general Antnio Guterres after scientists confirmed July was on track to be the worlds hottest month on record

Humanity is in the hot seat Guterres told a press conference on Thursday For vast parts of North America Asia Africa and Europe it is a cruel summer For the entire planet it is a disaster And for scientists it is unequivocal  humans are to blame

All this is entirely consistent with predictions and repeated warnings The only surprise is the speed of the change Climate change is here it is terrifying and it is just the beginning The era of global warming has ended the era of global boiling has arrived

The steady rise in global average temperatures driven by pollution that traps sunlight and acts like a greenhouse around the Earth has made weather extremes worse

Guterres urged politicians to take swift action adding that It is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 15C and avoid the very worst of climate change but only with dramatic immediate climate action We have seen some progress  a robust rollout of renewables and some positive steps from sectors such as shipping  but none of this is going far enough or fast enough Accelerating temperatures demand accelerated action

It is just so heartbreaking that so many whales have beached themselves says local volunteer Kaysanne Knucke as rescuers try to save a pod of longfinned pilot whales after a mass beaching in Western Australia

Drone footage showed the moment the pod of almost 100 whales moved tightly together before becoming stranding at Cheynes beach about 60km 37 miles east of Albany on Tuesday evening

Knunckey along with other volunteers were waistdeep in the ocean from 730am until after 11am pulling the live mammals back into the water and supporting them with the help of a sling It was freezing and hard to stand still just holding the whales she says The atmosphere was fairly positive and everyone is just trying to think of the bright side

Researchers from across Australia are baffled by the neverbeforeseen behaviour of the whales who were grouped together in a heart shape in the hours leading up to the beaching

The fact they were in one area very huddled and doing really interesting behaviours and looking around at times suggests something else is going on that we just dont know says Dr Vanessa Pirotta a wildlife scientist at Macquarie University

Analysing the clip Pirotta says a whale may have been sick or the pod may have become disorientated  but it was unlikely they were trying to avoid predators

Dr Olaf Meynecke a whale researcher at Griffith University says of all whales dolphins and porpoises pilot whales are most prone to mass strandings because of their strong emotional ties

They are so closely bonded its almost like they are stressing each other out  It kind of makes sense given their strong emotional bonding to their peers he says

Have you been to puppy yoga 

This wellness trend is on the rise and is exactly what it sounds like  a yoga sessions with puppies

But Esme Wheeler the RSPCAs dog welfare expert is very concerned about the activity because it is an overwhelmingly negative experience for the dogs

To strip a puppy of their choice and control at a formative stage of their development creates a basis for future problems which are common reasons for animals to be given to rehoming centres she says

If you love dogs and want to spend more time with them Wheeler recommends volunteering at an animal shelter or helping a friend with walking their pet over taking part in puppy yoga

Kerr is set to return after two games but this is not the case for many big names who have suffered anterior cruciate ligament ACL injuries

Its a real challenge for players due to the particularly long recovery time which means its not only careerchanging but also why weve seen so many tweaks to World Cup squads

The reigning champions the USA are without a host of key players while England are missing their Euro 2022 Golden Bootwinning forward Beth Mead captain Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby

While ACL injuries are not preventable there is consensus that more needs to be done to improve research around the multifaceted causes and to find ways to reduce the risks associated with them

Female athletes are far more susceptible to cruciate damage and Dr Katrine Okholm Kryger a medical researcher who specialises in womens football says it relates back to inequality between mens and womens football

We asked katokholmkryger to explain the main reasons why women are getting injured while playing football

Speaking publicly for the first time after his rescue an Australian sailor who was found adrift in the Pacific Ocean after three months has said he is grateful to be alive

Timothy Lyndsay Shaddock 54 set sail in April from the Mexican coastal city of La Paz bound for French Polynesia about 6000 km away but became stranded after a rough storm damaged his catamaran and knocked out the communications equipment

He was accompanied by a dog Bella who sort of found me in the middle of Mexico  I tried to find a home for her maybe three times and she just kept following me into the water Shaddock said

Shes a beautiful animal and Im just grateful shes alive

They survived the ordeal by eating raw fish and drinking rain water until they were found by a Mexican fishing ship

Touching dry land for the first time on Tuesday in the Mexican port city of Manzanillo after being examined onboard the boat that rescued him Shaddock said The captain and this fishing company that saved my life Im just so grateful

He added that he would be returning to Australia soon and was looking forward to seeing his family Bella was adopted by Genaro Rosales a member of the crew that rescued them
Their pledges were deployed for cynical political purposes

It was likely the Earths hottest week in history earlier this month according to preliminary data and top scientists agree that the planet will get even hotter unless we phase out fossil fuels

Yet leading energy companies are intent on pushing the world in the opposite direction expanding fossil fuel production and insisting that there is no alternative

It is evidence that they are motivated not by record warming but by record profits experts say

Amid recordshattering warmth this February BP scaled back an earlier goal of lowering its emissions by 35 by 2030 saying it will aim for a 20 to 30 cut instead

ExxonMobil quietly withdrew funding for a heavily publicized effort to use algae to create lowcarbon fuel And Shell announced that it would not increase its investments in renewable energy this year despite earlier promises to dramatically slash its emissions

They have left no doubt that their pledges were deployed for cynical political purposes only to be ditched when they no longer suited the industrys strategic position said Dan Cohn a global energy transition researcher at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis

These are not isolated heat events this is what the turbocharged climate change world looks like says Brenda Ekwurzel the director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US as millions of people across the world are hit by extreme heat

While the world endured the hottest week ever recorded between 310 July this year meteorologists say there is more to come  a lot more

July could be the hottest month for the last 120000 years according to Karsten Haustein a research fellow in atmospheric radiation at Leipzig University

In the last 24 hours alone wildfires have raged in the Canary Islands and Turkey with villagers in the southeast of Athens ordered to leave their homes on Monday as a wildfire burned nearby

Red weather alerts have been issued across Europe while China recorded its hottest day ever  a record temperature of 525C in the northwest of the country  over the weekend and Californias Death Valley among the hottest places on Earth reached a nearrecord 52C on Sunday

We are in uncharted territory and that is worrying news for the planet said Prof Christopher Hewitt the director of climate services at the World Meteorological Organization

The heatwaves that have battered the world recently show that climate change is out of control said UN secretary general Antnio Guterres as he warned that if the world delayed key measures needed to limit fossil fuel emissions it would move into a catastrophic situation

The Sun has distanced itself from a key part of its own story about a prominent BBC presenter

On Saturday the tabloid claimed a wellknown presenter gave a 20yearold crack cocaine user more than 35000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images

The most powerful of the newspapers allegations was that the young person was under 18 when they allegedly began selling pictures to the BBC presenter  raising the possibility that a serious criminal offence may have been committed 

Now the Sun is insisting it never alleged any illegal behaviour took place The person at the centre of the story now aged 20 and legally an adult has also insisted the newspapers claims of underage activity are rubbish

Disastrous floods have hit countries around the world this summer including China India Japan and the US after torrential rain in July that has left communities facing the loss of their homes loved ones and livelihoods

With scenes emerging of miles of devastation these extreme weather events are triggering warnings of the climate crisis intensifying

Its not surprising to see these events happening said Brian Soden professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami As the climate gets warmer we expect intense rain events to become more common

Atmospheric scientists in the US have warned that while these flooding disasters may be thousands of miles apart they all have one thing in common As the global average temperature increases  with the worlds temperature records broken on two days in a row this month while global sea surface temperatures were at record highs for the time of the year in May and June according to WMO   storms are forming in a warmer atmosphere making extreme rainfall a reality right now

A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture which results in storms dumping more precipitation that can have deadly outcomes And the additional global heating that scientists predict is coming will only make it worse

I need justice says a survivor of the migrant shipwreck in Greece 

They have been working with Forensis a research agency founded by Forensic Architecture who  along with the Guardian and media partners  have been investigating the incident on 14 June which left an estimated 500 people missing and presumed dead 

They have found that attempts by the Greek coastguard to tow a fishing trawler carrying hundreds of migrants may have caused the vessel to sink

The coastguard has strenuously denied that it attempted to tow the trawler and has said it would not comment on operational issues or the ongoing investigation which is confidential according to a Supreme Court Order

The joint investigation by the Guardian German public broadcaster ARDNDRFunk and Greek investigative outlet Solomon in collaboration with Forensis has given one of the fullest accounts to date of the trawlers course up to its sinking  read their full findings by clicking the link in bio
The public have the right to know what role money plays in our politics

This is what Steve Goodrich the head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK said about the Guardians recent investigation into shares held in secret by several dozen MPs or their close family members

The shareholdings identified by our reporter Henry Dyer are all within companies that could be affected by legislation or new policy introduced by parliament

The companies include for example the likes of oil and gas company BP our investigation found that six MPs or their close family members have shares that in total are worth nearly a combined 120000

Almost all of the holdings found are not strictly required to be publicly declared under parliamentary transparency rules requiring the disclosure of a shareholding in any single company worth more than 70000 or more than 15 of the companys stock In comparison members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have to declare within 45 days any trade in stocks over 1000

This means an MP could trade 6999999 in shares in a single company and not strictly be required to disclose the financial dealing They could hold stakes of this level in several companies operating in the same sector and still not be strictly required to declare the holdings

The difficulty in uncovering who owns shares in publicly listed companies in this country renders them in effect secret  which is very concerning says Susan Hawley the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption

If an MP has shares in a company affected by legislation going through parliament theres invariably a tension between them protecting their financial affairs and advancing the public good says Goodrich

Understanding who has skin in what game is essential to unpicking policy inertia be it on housing climate change or the cost of living

Why didnt they save the people first If they dont want illegal migrants let them deport us but dont let us drown

These were the words of Ahmed Farouq who lost his son in the Pylos shipwreck last month which left more than 500 people missing and presumed dead in one of the Mediterraneans worst boat disasters

Now according to a new investigation by the Guardian and media partners attempts by the Greek coastguard to tow the fishing trawler may have caused the vessel to sink

The overcrowded vessel carrying migrants from Libya to Italy sank off the coast of Greece on 14 June There were 104 survivors

Reporters and researchers conducted more than 20 interviews with survivors and drew on court documents and coastguard sources to build a picture of missed rescue opportunities and offers of assistance that were ignored

Multiple survivors said that attempts by the Greek coastguard to tow the vessel had ultimately caused the sinking Allegations have also been made that survivors statements were tampered with

The coastguard has strenuously denied that it attempted to tow the trawler and has said it would not comment on operational issues or the ongoing investigation which is confidential according to a Supreme Court Order

Have you downloaded the muchtalked about Threads app yet

When Metas new Twitterrival launched on Wednesday a battle between two billionaires began

The move from Mark Zuckerberg is a bold attempt to lure users away from its floundering competitor with a nearclone of the platform

Elon Musk has responded by threatening to sue Meta and saying Twitter had serious concerns that Meta Platforms Meta has engaged in systematic willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitters trade secrets and other intellectual property

Competition is fine cheating is not he later tweeted

Our media editior Jim Waterson tested it out and said After a day using Threads one thing is pretty clear it is not Twitter 

Instead Threads has the potential to be something different and powerful Twitter with fewer rough edges more corporate sheen and enough potential to suck the remaining life  and advertising revenue  out of Musks struggling network

Zuckerberg told a user on the app that The goal is to keep it friendly as it expands  Thats one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have and we want to do it differently

But many say its early days yet and Threads are reminiscent of what Twitter once was

Others are also keen to point out the potential issues of an even greater dominance of Meta on social media  it already owns Facebook WhatsApp and Instagram to which Threads is linked  and about the huge amount of personal data the app freely acknowledges it is collecting about users

Which of these doppelgngers do you think look the most alike

Photographed by francoisbrunelledoubles these lookalikes are not related but look strikingly like each other

But why are they so captivating and also confusing to look at

Its the differences that destabilise you  the same but different variations of nostril and ear which cause that familiar psychic wobble writes the Observers Eva Wiseman You really feel it when looking at the work of the Canadian artist

He was inspired to find and photograph more than 200 pairs of unrelated doppelgngers after being regularly told he looked like Rowan Atkinson  you can swipe to the last slide to see if you agree

The picture series Im Not a Lookalike which took 12 years to put together features men and women who stare out of the frame in the same way

When the project went viral it was brought to the attention of Dr Manel Esteller a researcher at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona who recruited 32 pairs of Brunelles lookalikes to take DNA tests and complete questionnaires about their lives What was the explanation for these doppelgngers he wondered What were we seeing He found that the 16 pairs who were true lookalikes according to facialrecognition software shared significantly more genes than the others that the software deemed less similar

Now there are so many people in the world Dr Esteller explained to the New York Times the system is repeating itself

Not only are apps that can find our doppelgngers multiplying the population is multiplying too at a pace which means we are all more likely to have one I just dont want to meet her writes Wiseman

Onsite drug testing facilities at music festivals encourage people to not play Russian roulette with their lives argues journalist Daisy Jones who says it helps some festivalgoers make safe informed choices

With hundreds of thousands of people descending on events this summer the Home Office has been accused by leading festival organisers artists and MPs of endangering the lives of festivalgoers after effectively blocking onsite drug testing this month by requiring festivals to apply for a special licence

Volunteerrun drugtesting facilities such as The Loop operate from festivals to provide a safe space for advice test drugs to check for substances that may put people at a greater level of risk and put out warnings if dangerous substances are found

Blocking these organisations from festival sites is risky and just another example of the UK governments puritanical approach to drug safety which isnt prioritising the facts says Jones

After a record 13 deaths from police shootings in France during traffic stops last year this was the second fatal incident in such circumstances in 2023

Three people were killed by police gunfire after refusing to comply with a traffic stop in 2021 and two in 2020 A Reuters tally of fatal shootings in 2021 and 2022 shows the majority of victims were black or Arabic origin

Something has to change

This is what Chloe Partridge a 22yearold from Arizona  a state which passed a law last year banning abortions after 15 weeks  said to the Guardian USs Poppy Noor

Chloe was forced to carry her pregnancy to term after the supreme court voted to overturn Roe v Wade despite having been told her baby had an unsurvivable medical condition She watched her baby die in distress after two days

To have to go fullterm and watch her die slowly over two days was so horrible I was forced to do that says Chloe Nobody should be able to choose what I do with my body

The US supreme court ruled one year ago that abortion is not protected under the constitution which means states now have the power to regulate the procedure as they see fit

Twelve months on the reality for many is grim

Since the ruling the legal landscape of the US has changed creating a patchwork of vastly unequal access to reproductive care

Abortion bans invalidated by Roe v Wade in some states were resurrected Elsewhere trigger laws designed to ban abortion if federal protections were overturned went into effect In other states new bans were passed

Now a year after the Dobbs decision abortion is banned in 14 states and severely restricted in five others affecting the lives of more than 27 million women

With the politicians we have now I dont see anything changing But this is bullshit says Chloe

However Chloe believes there are small reasons for hope People are becoming more aware of situations like hers she says and realise this is a disgusting way to treat women

I was used as a political pawn

Nazanin ZaghariRatcliffe has spoken about her experience being incarcerated in Iran at a talk at Glastonbury on Friday afternoon

The Iranian government would sacrifice their own citizens to feed their own agenda to the point that they dont even care about a young mother and her young child she said I was used as a political pawn for something that predated me The debt the British government owed the Iranian government was before I was even born

After spending six years in jail in Iran Nazanin ZaghariRatcliffe last year returned home to her family in Britain she was accused of spying by Iranian authorities an accusation she denied

During the talk she spoke about how seeing a supportive banner at the festival four years ago gave her hope

While I was in prison I had very little access to the outside world So I dont actually know what was happening I knew there was a campaign going on but I didnt exactly know the details or what was happening

She added But my parents did take one copy of a very low quality picture smuggled into Evin which was a banner from Glastonbury 2019 were all going to cry now that showed Free Nazanin  that shows how far your story can get if people care about you

Today a packed crowd at the Left Field tent on Worthy Farm stood and applauded Ms ZaghariRatcliffe for around 40 seconds after a speech she made in the middle of a debate by an allfemale panel to discuss the rights of women in Iran

In 1948 from Kingston Jamaica to Tilsbury Docks the ship brought over 492 West Indian passengers  a postwar generation that helped rebuild the UK and paved the way for others to follow

Five years ago the Windrush scandal revealed how decades after arriving in Britain Caribbeanborn UK residents have been wrongly detained deported and denied legal rights When the whole world was against them the did this amazing thing despite of that said Kellie Brothwood whose grandfather was Trinidadian and thats the reason why were here today

Kamau and Kellie were joined by Bianca Judd whose Trinidadian grandfather served in the British airforce and Dane Gardner whose grandad was a passenger on Empire the Windrush from Jamaica This is why they want their families to be remembered

Is Ozempic really a miracle drug or the latest sign of how unwell our societys relationship to size and weight is

In a new personal essay Rachel Pick looks at the rise of Ozempic and how quickly it has erased the modest gains of the body positivity movement which was by no means perfect itself

When you go to such absurd lengths just to winnow yourself down a little you are actively trying to put as much distance between yourself and fat people as you possibly can Pick writes It tells us that a part of you is disgusted by us that a part of you has contempt for the way we are and the way we look

When a mass drowning such as this one hits the headlines governments squirm as their own culpability is probed says journalist Diane Taylor who writes on human rights racism and civil liberties

About 80 people are confirmed to have died and up to 500 people are still missing including many children after a crowded fishing vessel sank off the coast of Greece last week in one of the Mediterraneans deadliest boat disasters in recent years

Nine suspected people smugglers appeared in court this week accused of piloting the vessel But Taylor argues no matter that kingpins of smuggling operations generally dont pilot overloaded leaky boats across dangerous expanses of water  governments should look to their policies and rhetoric instead of diverting blame in order to stop the deaths

While many smugglers may be greedy and ruthless they are responding to human demand  the decision to escape is made first and the smuggler is sought second she adds in her latest Guardian opinion article

About 27000 people have died or disappeared while trying to cross the Mediterranean since 2014 according to the International Organization for Migration IoM

Greek authorities have also been criticised for their failure to act more quickly to stop this disaster and have rejected claims that the boat capsized after the coastguard attempted to tow it This disaster also comes nearly a month after the EU called for an independent inquiry into video footage brought to light by the New York Times that purports to show the illegal deportation of refugees out of the countrys border

Were living a nightmare

This was Leshie Chandrapalas reaction to watching a newly released video appearing to show a Christmas party at Conservative party headquarters during coronavirus restrictions Her father Ranjith Chandrapala 64 was a bus driver on the Ealing hospital route from the beginning of the coronavirus crisis he died in May 2020 

Leshie says she felt a physical sickness the first time she saw the footage She is one of hundreds of members of the Covid19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK who have expressed their anger and frustration over the video

The footage which was obtained by the Mirror newspaper appears to show members of staff drinking alcohol and dancing on 14 December 2020 at a gathering held by the campaign team of the unsuccessful London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey who has since been given a peerage in Johnsons resignation honours list At least 24 people were reportedly in attendance On the day the party reportedly took place then health secretary Matt Hancock announced that London would enter tier 3 restrictions in order to contain a surging number of Covid infections 232 people lost their lives to the pandemic that day

The levelling up secretary Michael Gove apologised for the video describing the actions of those involved as terrible and indefensible but said it would not be right for him to say whether the Metropolitan police should reopen it investigation into the lockdownbreaking event 

A photograph of the party formed part of a Met police investigation last year Police found insufficient evidence of law breaking and no fines were issued as the force said the photo by itself is not sufficient evidence on which to assess that an offence had been committed

The force has said it is assessing video footage that was not previously provided to officers when investigating an event in Matthew Parker Street on 14 December 2020

These are the words of 27yearold forest defender Daman Matis He helps to police a riverside government protection base in the Amazon on one of the waterways that illegal gold miners use to invade protected Indigenous lands

One year after the killings of Bruno Pereira a renowned defender of the rights of Brazils Indigenous peoples and Dom Phillips a British journalist and longtime Guardian contributor the battle to protect the worlds greatest rainforest is intensifying

Activists are defiant in the face of the many dangers of confronting the environmental criminals and organised crime groups who have tightened their grip on the Amazon region and are increasingly threatening the Indigenous peoples who have lived there since long before European explorers arrived in the 16th century

So what now

From ramping up international support to building intelligent infrastructure the Guardians global environment editor Jonathan Watts has set out seven steps that would help reverse the Amazons destruction

Abortion is healthcare it is a fundamental right for women to have control over their own bodies and over their own lives says lawyer Charlotte Proudman 
This week a 44yearold woman was sentenced to more than two years in prison for procuring drugs to induce an abortion after the legal limit 
She was convicted under Offences against the Person Act an archaic Victorian law which dates back to a time before women had the vote 
Under this 162yearold legislation the decision to terminate an unplanned pregnancy using pills in the privacy of a home is punishable by prison and the maximum sentence is life imprisonment

The news has been met with real horror from people says drproudman who has found that most people thought that abortion was decriminalised in the UK 
The woman believed she was 28 weeks pregnant but doctors later concluded the foetus was from 32 to 34 weeks gestation at the time of termination

In England Scotland and Wales abortion is partially decriminalised up to 24 weeks so long as strict conditions were in place such as a confirmation from two medical practitioners that the pregnancy had not exceeded 24 weeks or that the termination was necessary to prevent injury or mental harm Any abortion outside these criteria is still a criminal offence 
We cant access reproductive healthcare without giving reasons and meeting stringent legal conditions says Dr Proudman 
The recent sentencing has led to calls from campaigners for legal reform and concern from health experts that the sentencing could open the door to more prosecutions 
The number of women and girls facing police investigations and the threat of life imprisonment under current abortion laws has risen over the past three years according to BPAS In 2022 a woman who used abortion medication in a failed attempt to end her own pregnancy was reported to the police by her medical team 
Watch to find out why Dr Proudman thinks abortion should be fully decriminalised

Scientists have created synthetic human embryos using stem cells in a groundbreaking advance that sidesteps the need for eggs or sperm

Scientists say these model embryos which resemble those in the earliest stages of human development could provide a crucial window on the impact of genetic disorders and the biological causes of recurrent miscarriage

However the work also raises serious ethical and legal issues as the labgrown entities fall outside current legislation in most countries

The structures do not have a beating heart or the beginnings of a brain but include cells that would typically go on to form the placenta yolk sac and the embryo itself

The development highlights how rapidly the science in this field has outpaced the law and scientists iare already moving to draw up voluntary guidelines to govern work on synthetic embryos

If the whole intention is that these models are very much like normal embryos then in a way they should be treated the same Robin LovellBadge the head of stem cell biology and developmental genetics at the Francis Crick Institute in London said Currently in legislation theyre not People are worried about this

Tens of thousands of dead fish washed up on the Gulf coast of Texas over the weekend covering the shoreline with rotting carcasses and leading local officials to warn visitors to keep away

Low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water made it difficult for the fish to breathe Texas parks and wildlife department officials said The phenomenon  known as a fish kill  is common as temperatures rise in the summer the state department said

While no one has connected this specific incident to climate change researchers have said such kills may become more prevalent as temperatures warm and oxygen levels in lakes across the United States and Europe drop

Dissolved oxygen levels increase with photosynthesis the process by which plants transform sunlight water and carbon dioxide into oxygen When there is less sunlight photosynthesis slows and at night it stops But plants and animals in the water continue to consume oxygen at the same rate decreasing the concentration Texas parks and wildlife officials said

Gulf menhaden which fishers commonly use for bait was the species most affected in the kill parks and wildlife officials said

Katie St Clair the manager of the sea life facility Texas AM University at Galveston told NPR that gulf menhaden is a popular snack for sea animals and with this dieoff of fish there is a huge nutrient pulse into our environment

Its kind of a circle of life she added

Campaigners and MPs have reacted with outrage to a woman being sentenced to more than two years in prison for procuring drugs to induce an abortion after the legal limit

The mother of three received the medication under the pills by post scheme which was introduced during the Covid pandemic for unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks after a remote consultation

Prosecutors said the woman had knowingly misled the British Pregnancy Advisory Service BPAS by saying she was below the 10week cutoff when she believed she was about 28 weeks pregnant

Doctors later concluded the foetus was from 32 to 34 weeks gestation between seven and eight months at the time of termination In England Scotland and Wales abortion is generally legal up to 24 weeks but is carried out in a hospital or clinic after 10 weeks

The woman 44 pleaded guilty in March under the Offences against the Person Act legislation that dates back to 1861 and will serve half of her 28month sentence in custody and the remaining under licence Originally she had pleaded not guilty to a charge of an offence of child destruction

The judge in the case said the woman felt very deep and genuine remorse and was racked with guilt and plagued by nightmares over her actions

The judge said there were no sentencing guidelines for the offence but that the maximum sentence was life imprisonment

Mandu Reid the leader of the Womens Equality party said This conviction serves no one not her not her children not the public interest All it does is punish a woman for seeking healthcare in the middle of a pandemic and risk deterring women who want or need an abortion from seeking that care in future No one deserves to be criminalised for seeking healthcare which is a human right

For Manchester City it was the crowning glory the trophy that they have craved to complete the ultimate set It is often said that clubs must suffer before they win the Champions League and how City have done so especially during the Pep Guardiola years when domestic dominance has brought no guarantees in Europes elite and most capricious competition

They suffered some more here Internazionale pushing them all the way much further than many had expected The team that finished third in Serie A were the equal of City for much of a highstress night here in Istanbul

There was a moment just before the hour when Guardiola sank to his knees as Lautaro Martnez rushed up the left only to shoot too close to Ederson It was a long way from being the kind of crushing City performance that Premier League supporters have grown used to

It was only about the result and City found a way to it through the force of their personality It had become increasingly clear that one moment could be all that either side needed and City made it happen when Manuel Akanji played in Bernardo Silva up the right and when his pullback deflected there was Rodri running on to the loose ball to send a low shot fizzing home

Boris Johnson is standing down immediately as a Conservative MP after an investigation into the Partygate scandal found he misled parliament and recommended a lengthy suspension from the House of Commons

The former prime minister angrily accused the investigation of trying to drive him out and claimed there was a witchhunt under way to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result

In a bitter 1000word statement he attacked Rishi Sunaks government blaming the current prime minister for rising taxes not being Conservative enough and failing to make the most of Brexit

Johnson added It is very sad to be leaving parliament  at least for now  but above all I am bewildered and appalled that I can be forced out antidemocratically by a committee chaired and managed by the Labour MP Harriet Harman with such egregious bias

The resignation will trigger an immediate byelection in Johnsons Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency It was the second in a day for Sunak after Nadine Dorries resigned as MP for Mid Bedfordshire after her inclusion on Johnsons peerage list was blocked Labour sources view both the seats as potentially winnable

Johnsons dramatic move came on the day Sunak cleared a resignation honours list for him including more than 40 peerages and other rewards for some of his closest allies from the time of the Partygate scandal

It took me a sporting lifetime to say I was proud to be a swimmer says former professional athlete Michael Gunning

The swimmer who has competed for Great Britain and Jamaica grew up hearing racist negative stereotypes like Black people dont swim and Black people sink in water and knows first hand how these comments can stop people especially people of colour from participating in sport

Last year michaelgunning1 decided to step away from competitive sport and now has made it his mission to provide opportunities for the disadvantaged and underprivileged children and further eliminate the negative stereotypes around Black boys and girls swimming

Hes become a Speedo ambassador on their Swim United campaign which aims to unite different communities all over the world to support pupils taking up swimming He says I want to work on diversifying sport as a whole and eliminate these barriers to get more representation of all children in grassroots sport

Gunning thinks positive representation is one way we can encourage young people of colour to take up swimming He hopes Disneys remake of The Little Mermaid with Black actor and singer hallebailey will provide inspire young viewers

I see a glow in the young childrens eyes when they watch the trailer of The Little Mermaid for the first time  they can finally see themselves in roles like this says Gunning

He say he wants others to learn from the racism he has had to content with throughout his career watch the video to hear what he has to say

Federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump with violating the Espionage Act and conspiring to obstruct the criminal investigation among other counts according to a person familiar with the matter a historic development marking the most significant legal peril yet for the former president

The exact nature of the sevencount indictment filed by the office of special counsel Jack Smith in federal district court in Miami remains unclear At least some of the counts include willful retention of national security materials obstruction scheme to conceal false statements and conspiracy the person said

Trump and his legal team were told of the charges on Thursday afternoon Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm the person said confirming what the former president posted on his Truth Social platform

For more than a year prosecutors have examined whether Trump knowingly retained classified documents at his MaraLago resort in Florida after he left office and took steps to conceal the materials after the justice department issued a subpoena for their return

Criminal charges against Trump in the MaraLago documents investigation means the former president is now a defendant in a second case after he was indicted on state charges in New York by the Manhattan district attorney over his role in hushmoney payments to an adult film star in 2016

The indictment by the special counsel Jack Smith appointed by the US attorney general Merrick Garland to lead the documents investigation also means the country must grapple with the unprecedented situation of a twiceimpeached twicecharged former president running for reelection

Prince Harry appeared to fight back tears as he finished giving evidence in the phonehacking trial at the high court saying there was hard evidence that he had been illegally targeted by Mirror Group Newspapers

The prince spent eight hours in the witness box across two days breaking with protocol as he became the first royal to be crossexamined in a court since 1891 He told the court that British newspapers had illegally targeted him all his life and then gone to extreme lengths to cover their tracks

Asked how he felt as he finished giving evidence the prince replied quietly Its a lot Harry said he had decided to accuse the Mirror Sunday Mirror and People of hacking and illegal informationgathering after being disgusted by the way tabloids reported on his wife Meghan

The Mirror accepts its reporters hacked the phones of many celebrities in the 2000s but says it did not use these tactics on Harry
Andrew Green KC the Mirrors barrister previously told the court that Harry had indulged in total speculation about how news articles were obtained He told Harry there was no evidence his phone had been hacked by journalists working for Mirror Group Newspapers There is not a single item of call data at any time to your mobile phone

This angered Harry who appealed directly to the judge My lord my whole life the press have misled me covered up their wrongdoing To be sitting here in court knowing that the defence has the evidence in front of them and Mr Green saying Im speculating  Im not entirely sure what to say about that

Before you read on  can you guess what percentage of sea ice melting in the Arctic is the result of humancaused global heating 

Its 90 with natural factors accounting for the rest according to new research that has found it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice

The scientists who carried out the study are warning preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result

Analysis shows that even if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced the Arctic will be icefree in September in coming decades The study also shows that if emissions decline slowly or continue to rise the first icefree summer could be in the 2030s a decade earlier than previous projections

As scientists weve been warning about the loss of Arctic summer sea ice for decades This is now the first major component of the Earth system that we are going to lose because of global warming People didnt listen to our warnings said Prof Dirk Notz of the University of Hamburg Germany who was part of the research team

Since satellite records began in 1979 summer Arctic ice has shrunk by 13 a decade in one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis Arctic sea ice reaches its annual minimum at the end of summer in September and in 2021 it was at its second lowest extent on record

Thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate after a dam in southern Ukraine was badly damaged triggering potentially deadly flooding

In the early hours on Tuesday footage began to emerge on social media showing most of the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River washed away and a massive surge of water heading downstream The Ukrainian government has accused Russian occupation troops of blowing up the dam

The dam lies about 20 miles 30km east of the city of Kherson which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022 Its reservoir holds an estimated 18 cubic km of water  about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah  and supplies cooling water to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant Destroying the dam would add to Ukraines ongoing energy problems after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure

Occupying Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling with the local Russianinstalled mayor calling it a terrorist act

This was a disaster

A groundbreaking analysis reveals how police in Portland Oregon blanketed the city with toxic chemicals during a 2020 protest against the murder of George Floyd raising concerns about global teargas use

Forensic Architecture FA a research agency that investigates human rights violations created a 3D simulation of the Portland police bureaus extraordinary use of teargas during the protest on 2 June 2020

FA worked with weapons experts to analyze hundreds of videos from that evening along with internal police files invoice records manufacturer data and photos of teargas canisters

The analysis reveals that the citys downtown was blanketed with gas at more than 50 times the level federal regulators consider immediately dangerous to life or health

The research renews pressure on the scandalridden police department and raises significant public health and civil rights concerns at a time when law enforcement agencies in the US and across the globe are escalating their use of teargas on crowds including against protesters for abortion rights and police accountability

Protesters in at least 100 US cities were met with teargas attacks in 2020 and in the three years since law enforcement agencies have continued to deploy the chemical munition against crowds

I hope at some point we as a society can see there isnt a need for this type of policing that allows for this violence to happen to people and that we dismantle it Teressa Raiford executive director of Dont Shoot said

There was a lot of emotional physical and mental trauma from that summer said Dr Brianna da Silva Bhatia a Portlandbased health strategist with Physicians for Human Rights This was a disaster that fractured the community and accountability would be law enforcement owning that

I wanted to make trans people feel loved supported and safe Thats all I was trying to do says Riz Possnett after protesting the gendercritical academic Kathleen Stocks talk at the University of Oxford

This week footage of the trans activist glueing themself to the debating chamber close to the speakers chair was shared across social media

The demonstration temporarily halted Stocks speech as the police removed the activist  but Possnett says they didnt want to stop the talk only disrupt it

I respect Kathleens right to free speech but Im also painfully aware of the consequences her speeches have on trans people in the UK says Possnett

Stock who argues that transgender people cannot expect all the rights afforded by biological sex had been speaking over the sound of up to 200 people protesting outside about her invitation when a group of activists stormed the debating chamber on Tuesday During the event Stock insisted she was not antitrans despite what her critics said

According to Possnett many students didnt want Stock speaking at their university  with the student union and elected committee voting to condemn the Unions invitation of the academic

Students had organised a trans pride to take place on campus to protest Stocks speech and celebrate trans lives but Possnett felt like they needed to do something more

While questioning the witness Cheryl Morman a childcare expert Mullin shot back at her call for realism saying I dont want reality

The remark prompted laughter in the hearing room

Mullin is an election denier former cage fighter and plumbing company owner who sat in the US House before being elected to the Senate last year

His confrontational style has made headlines before In March for example he told a Teamsters leader to shut your mouth during a fiery exchange

If Indigenous communities are not supported and able to protect their rainforests all of us will suffer

One year ago Bruno Pereira a renowned defender of the rights of Brazils Indigenous peoples and Dom Phillips a British journalist and longtime Guardian contributor were killed on the frontline of the battle to protect the planet

They were ambushed on the Amazons Itaqua River while returning from a reporting trip to the remote Javari valley region

The attack prompted international outcry and cast a spotlight on the growing threat to the Amazon posed by extractive industries both legal and illegal such as logging poaching mining and cattle ranching which continue to make billions off the rainforests raw materials  with disastrous consequences

Today we launch the Bruno and Dom project a yearlong collaborative investigation coordinated by Forbidden Stories that involves more than 50 journalists from 16 media organisations in 10 countries around the world

The goal is to honour and pursue their work to foreground the importance of the Amazon and its people and to suggest possible ways to save the Amazon In this video the Guardians Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips looks at their lives and legacies

Human activity has pushed the world into the danger zone in seven out of eight new indicators of planetary safety and justice according to a groundbreaking analysis of the Earths wellbeing

Going beyond climate disruption the report by the Earth Commission group of scientists presents disturbing evidence that our planet faces growing crises of water availability nutrient loading ecosystem maintenance and aerosol pollution

These pose threats to the stability of lifesupport systems and worsen social equality

The study is the most ambitious attempt yet to combine vital signs of planetary health with indicators of human welfare It sets out a series of safe and just benchmarks for the planet that can be compared to the vital signs for the human body

Instead of pulse temperature and blood pressure the eight indicators it looks at are climate functional integrity natural ecosystem area water flow groundwater nitrogen phosphorus and aerosols

The authors say the planetary diagnosis is grim but not yet beyond hope though the time for a remedy is running out

Joyeeta Gupta the Earth Commission cochair said Our doctor would say the Earth is really quite sick right now in many areas And this is affecting the people living on Earth We must not just address symptoms but also the causes

Its taught me more about what I enjoy

More and more people are choosing to go without sex And in many cases theyve never been happier

Take Caitlin She didnt set out to become celibate  at least not in the beginning Three years ago she was coming out of an abusive relationship and wasnt ready to meet someone else

I thought during that time I needed space to heal and reflect on what Id been through she says

Caitlins celibacy three years in now became intentional Its taught me more about what I enjoy in sex which I wasnt expecting I thought it was going to put me at a disadvantage but I feel a lot more confident in my own sexuality she says

How does your body respond to alcohol

There is evidence that humans were brewing their own booze even before the wheel caught on but how much do we know about how it works on our brains and bodies

Well quite a bit Recent decades have seen dozens of studies validate some old sayings debunk others and give the medical establishment a much clearer understanding of how alcohol affects us and how much it is really OK to drink

In 2015 Tom Turcich left his hometown in New Jersey with one destination the world

Pushed to consider the meaning of life after his close friends death when he was 17 and inspired by the film Dead Poets Society Turcich started to make plans for his travels He would endlessly study maps working out the best routes Much of it depended on practicalities such as which countries insisted on a visa

At his sendoff his father couldnt have been more excited I was like hey go for it Aw gee just be careful have a good time he says But his mother cried for months when he left

Eleven months of the first year was spent walking and sleeping out  typically behind churches and in woods He came across tarantulas and snakes particularly on the palm plantations where he slept in Costa Rica

Turcich says he met so many wonderful people along the way He was already an optimist when he set off but by the time he returned he had even more faith in humankind if less in some of the systems we live under

The first two years were about me and the mind After that it became much more about the world I started to understand it more I became more interested in what influences people and why countries are the way they are Turcich said

Turcich walked 2124 miles a day for roughly half of the seven years he was away In total he walked 28000 miles and his dog Savannah 25000 miles He is the 10th person to have walked the world and he assumes Savannah is the first dog to have done so

When Mohammad Hashemi woke up this time last week he was told that his cousin Majid Kazemi had been executed  along with Saleh Mirhashemi and Saeed Yaqoubi The Iranian regime had claimed three men were responsible for the deaths of three members of the security forces during antigovernment protests in November

Immediately after their execution state media reran video posts of what were presented as the mens confessions which Amnesty International said had been extracted by torture
Speaking to the Guardian from Sydney mohammadhashemii said his cousin was tormented by interrogators

Kazemi was also allegedly subjected to mock executions at least 15 times and reportedly shown a video of one of his brothers being tortured

In an audio message recorded inside Dastgerd prison Kazemi said I swear to God I am innocent I didnt have any weapons on me Security forces kept beating me and ordering me to say this weapon is mine  I told them I would say whatever they wanted just please leave my family alone

Tina Turner has died at the age of 83 after a long illness

The pioneering rocknroll star who became a pop behemoth in the 1980s affirmed and amplified Black womens formative stake in rocknroll She defined that era of music to the extent that Mick Jagger admitted to taking inspiration from her highkicking energetic live performances for his stage persona

After two decades of working with her abusive husband Ike Turner she struck out alone and  after a few false starts  became one of the defining pop icons of the 1980s with the album Private Dancer

Turner had suffered ill health in recent years being diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and having a kidney transplant in 2017

In a statement a representative said Tina Turner the Queen of Rockn Roll has died peacefully today at the age of 83 after a long illness in her home in Kusnacht near Zurich Switzerland With her the world loses a music legend and a role model

Turners musical character has always been a charged combination of mystery as well as light melancholy mixed with a ferocious vitality that often flirted with danger scholar Daphne A Brooks wrote for the Guardian in 2018

Olivia Watson has always been hotheaded

For many years she was an aid worker caught in events that were worth being angry about the civil war in Syria the 2014 Gaza war Hurricane Matthew in Haiti In those contexts it was weird if you werent furious or an alcoholic or maybe both she writes

But it wasnt until after the pandemic and one particularly bad blowup that she decided to enroll in a 10week anger management course

She thought it might help  after all such sessions have been seen as the definitive solution for anger issues for decades now

But Olivia didnt find the easy cure she was looking for While she found the basic techniques of the course and the support system it offered to be helpful it also neglected the root causes of some anger

In the onedimensional world of anger management it turns out there is no big picture and there is no room for broader questions about the society we all live in  or to put it another way reality she writes

From the word go within clinical placement I always felt very heavily sexualised by patients she said One time when I had to get close up to a patients face to examine his eyes the patient started licking his lips and rubbing himself I was 19 or 20 at the time and the consultant had left the room  I was completely terrified

This is the experience of Katie not her real name a junior doctor in the southeast of England She said she did not feel she could tell anyone as she found most of the consultants intimidating

Katie is one of thousands of hospital staff who are reporting claims of sexual assaults and harassment by patients an investigation has found prompting calls for ministers to address the daily threat of abuse faced by doctors and nurses

More than 20000 alleged incidents of sexual violence and sexual misconduct by patients on hospital staff were recorded in the five years to 2022 by 212 NHS trusts in England freedom of information FoI requests by the Guardian and the British Medical Journal BMJ found

The 20928 cases accounted for just under 60 of the total alleged incidents trusts disclosed Allegations included claims of rape sexual assault harassment stalking and sexualised remarks

Experts cautioned that the figures were likely to be a serious underestimate as staff are often deterred from making complaints when patients abuse them

Deeba Syed a senior legal officer at the Rights of Women helpline said Women tell us they are expected to continue to care for patients who are abusive or harassing without efforts to adequately safeguard them from further harassment

We hear worrying reports of women feeling pressured into not raising formal grievances and instead being transferred to different departments or locations They tell us it is argued that this is more expedient than moving the harassing patient despite victims feeling this is unsafe to others and a punishment on them

Cover someone elses story follow someone else says presenter and journalist Chant Joseph responding to the BBCs latest Panorama episode Private ADHD Clinics Exposed

In the film that came out last Monday night the documentary aimed to show people that patients are being offered powerful drugs and are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD after unreliable online assessments

After watching the episode however a number of people who have ADHD criticised the piece including chantayyjayy She said The main problem with the documentary is that it makes ADHD diagnosis look very trivial and easy and accessible  and for her that wasnt the case

In the video we talk to Chant and Dr Samantha Hiew adhdgirls about the need for better intersectional representation of the ADHD community and why its much easier for white men to get diagnosed

A BBC spokesperson said Panorama made clear that ADHD is a recognised condition affecting many adults and highlighted the long waits for assessment and treatment on the NHS in some areas

This was an investigation into the way some private clinics diagnose and prescribe ADHD medication following assessments conducted over online video calls

We recognise the profound impact the condition can have on peoples lives and have taken great care to ensure the programme doesnt stigmatise people who have ADHD We encourage people to watch the documentary

If only the scientists whod warned the world decades ago had been listened to But no that wouldnt have won votes or made the rich richer My heart is broken

This is what one of our readers wrote in response to this cartoon by the Guardians Steve Bell

He created this piece after scientists issued a warning that our overheating world is now 66 likely to breach the 15 C climate threshold in the next five years

Hitting this point would break the key temperature limit that countries pledged to under the 2015 Paris climate agreement

Experts say this could have dire consequences and might unleash a cascade of increasingly catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts according to research from the World Meteorological Organisation WMO

New record temperatures have been set in many areas around the world in the heatwaves of the past year but those highs may only be the beginning according to the report as climate breakdown and the impact of a developing El Nio weather system combine to create heatwaves across the globe

El Nio is part of an oscillating weather system that develops in the Pacific For the past three years the world has been in the opposing phase known as La Nia which has had a dampening effect on temperature increases around the world

If the world passes the limit scientists stress the breach while worrying will likely be temporary

In response to this report Antnio Guterres the secretary general of the UN tweeted The climate crisis can feel overwhelming But I urge you to remember one vital fact limiting global temperature rise to 15 degrees is still possible We have all the tools we need to get the job done Lets accelerate ClimateAction  now

Saltier than seawater 

New research has revealed that half the pizzas eaten in Britain contain all of the salt that government scientists say we should be eating in a day

Nutritional analysis of 1387 different pizzas bought in shops supermarkets takeaways and restaurants shows that one of the Dominos range has more than three days worth of salt in it

The brands sizzler standard mozzarella stuffed crust medium pizza emerged as the UKs saltiest pizza in the research It contains 214 grams of salt which makes it saltier than seawater In contrast the maximum daily intake as recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition SACN is just six grams

Action on Salt found that Zizzi Franco Manca and Crosta  Mollica are the retailers and manufacturers with the saltiest pizzas per 100g while Dominos Papa Johns and Caprinos are the worst offenders in the restaurant and takeaway sector

However it also identified the brands with the smallest amounts of salt per 100g Goodfellas Morrisons and the Coop are the retailers and manufacturers whose pizzas contain the lowest amounts of salt with Bella Italia Pizza Express and Fireaway among the restaurant and takeaway operators offering the least salty pizzas

Health experts said the high levels of salt in one of the countrys favourite foods is worrying because it leads to high blood pressure which is the leading cause of heart attacks and strokes

A Department of Health and Social Care DHSC spokesperson said Thanks to our salt reduction programme the amount of salt in food has fallen by about 20  helping to prevent nearly 70000 heart attacks and strokes while reducing pressure on the NHS

We will continue to work closely with industry to make it easier for people to make healthier choices

The bill doesnt allow for queer survival whatsoever says DeLovie Kwagala

The queer photographer and activist from Uganda says they felt force to flee to South Africa as their home country began implementing the hardline antiLGBTQ bill known as the kill the gays bill

Despite four amendments the bill retains most of the harshest measures of the legislation adopted in March Those include the death penalty for certain samesex acts and a 20year sentence for promoting homosexuality which activists say could criminalise any advocacy for the rights of lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer citizens

President Yoweri Museveni a vocal opponent of LGBTQ rights applauded lawmakers for having rejected the pressure from the imperialists Museveni now has until the end of the month to either sign the legislation into law return it to parliament for another revision or veto it and inform the parliamentary speaker The bill will however pass into law without the presidents assent if he returns it to parliament for a second time

While in South Africa Kwagala  who is nonbinary  was notified by the Ugandan authorities that they would be arrested on their return due to their work photographing queer people and fundraising to support Ugandas LGTBQ community through their charity hashtagwhatnext Because fundraising and visible activism are seen as aiding the promotion of homosexuality aconstantbecoming told the Guardian

Their South African study visa expires on 24 May and they cannot change their conditions from within the country meaning they are forced to return to Uganda

Speaking about the situation for queer people in Uganda Kwagala said We are now starting to get a backlog of requests because the capacity we have cant hold all the needs so we still need your help and support as folks continue to be fired from jobs chased out of houses and villages threatened to be burned alive upon the bills signature

This is what Reggie Mcgoon  or Nana Reggie  remembers when she first started expressing her identity as a trans woman freely after taking inspiration from the celebration of a third gender in traditional Fijian culture

The iTaukei term vakasalewalewa refers to people assigned male at birth but who have a feminine gender expression and whose identity as both is celebrated  something that changed after Britain colonised Fiji in 1874

Mcgoon remembers at school she was told off by teachers for always playing with the girls and there was no discussion of alternative gender identities

People wouldnt talk about it because it was a big taboo because its instilled into young peoples minds because this is a Christian country and we shouldnt talk about these things

Vakasalewalewa is a term that we are continuously reclaiming unapologetically in recognition of our rich history traditions and our right to exist says Sulique Waqa founder of Haus of Khameleon a Fijibased movement advocating for transgender equality in the Pacific

After 18 rounds of chemotherapy Samuel Castleberry pictured above on slide one says he is tired

If it were up to him hed still be working his trucking job The 59yearold was making a decent living and felt fit But in June 2020 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer which has already spread to his liver Now he gets out of breath wheeling his garbage can to the curb at his home in Alabama

Thirteen years ago he helped clean up BPs Deepwater Horizon oil spill just off the coast of Louisiana the largest ever in US waters  and he was not alone

More than 33000 others rushed toward the toxic oil to save the place they loved joining forces to clean up our coastlines

According to the Alaska toxicologist Riki Ott the valor they displayed was comparable to the heroism of first responders during the 911 terror attacks who ran to the World Trade Center to save people and breathed in toxic dust and fumes

What resident and professional oil spill responders do is exactly what professional firefighters and emergency responders everywhere do put their lives on the line to protect ours she says

However since the cleanup thousands of Deep Horizons first responders have become chronically and in some cases fatally sick

They have experienced chronic respiratory issues rashes and diarrhea  a problem known among local residents as BP syndrome or Gulf coast syndrome Many have also developed debilitating longterm illnesses including cancer

Yet despite recently posting 5bn in quarterly profit BP has denied compensation to thousands of workers suffering from longterm health damages

Its by far the most gutwrenching public health disaster that Ive ever been exposed to Whats particularly frustrating is BP doesnt care said Tom Devine the legal director for the Government Accountability Project

The Guardian interviewed dozens of those former cleanup workers  many had never spoken publicly before

BP declined to comment on a series of detailed questions from the Guardian citing the ongoing litigation

We left everything behind says Alejandro Rangel Gonzlez who was trying to cross into the US after 11pm local time last night Why 11pm

Thats when the US lifted a coronavirusrelated immigration restriction called Title 42
Its an arcane public health law that has allowed the US to quickly expel migrants at the USMexico border since 2020 which it said was aimed at protecting Americans from disease

Since the start of the pandemic the right to claim asylum in the US has been blocked for many fleeing political and economic crises especially from Central and South American countries the Caribbean and parts of Africa

For 21 years Abu Zubaydah has been in US custody without charge tortured and sexually humiliated with no prospect for release

Zubaydah 52 was captured in Pakistan in March 2002 taken to several CIA dark sites and transferred to Guantnamo in 2006 where he has been held ever since He was the first victim of what was to become the widespread use of torture by the US against terror suspects

The drawings are a powerful depiction of what happened to him and are remarkable given that he has not been able to communicate directly with the outside world Zubaydahs international legal representative Helen Duffy said

Videotapes of Zubaydah being tortured were filmed by the CIA but then destroyed in violation of a court order while a 6700page torture report by the Senate intelligence committee remains secret almost a decade after it was completed

Though the full Senate report has never been made public its conclusion is known that the abuse of Zubaydah and other detainees failed to elicit any new intelligence In other words torture does not work

Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the blockaded Gaza Strip have continued fighting despite reports of ceasefire negotiations in a bloody episode of violence that has left 28 people in Gaza dead and one person in Israel dead

Palestinian militant groups launched a volley of rockets into Israel on Wednesday bringing daily life in Tel Aviv to a standstill after Israel carried out airstrikes targeting the leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza on Tuesday

Tensions have been running high since Khader Adnan a prominent political figure affiliated with Islamic Jihad died on hunger strike in Israeli custody

Among the victims of the strike on Tuesday Dania Adas and her 16yearold sister Iman Adas The sisters were both killed when Israeli jets hit the building next door where an alleged senior Islamic Jihad leader Khalil AalBahtini lived with his wife and daughter all of whom were also killed

Israeli officials said Bahtini was one of three senior leaders from Islamic Jihad targeted in the strikes accusing him of being the commander responsible for a barrage of rocket attacks on Israel last week

Tensions in the IsraeliPalestinian conflict have soared over the past year more than 100 Palestinians and at least 19 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in 2023 so far across Israel the West Bank and the Gaza Strip leading to worries that a return to fullscale conflict is on the horizon

The first UK baby created with DNA from three people has been born after doctors performed a groundbreaking IVF procedure that aims to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases the Guardians science editor Ian Sample has revealed in his exclusive

The technique known as mitochondrial donation treatment MDT uses tissue from the eggs of healthy female donors to create IVF embryos that are free from harmful mutations their mothers carry  as people inherit all their mitochondria from their mother  and are likely to pass on to their children

Because the embryos combine sperm and egg from the biological parents with tiny batterylike structures called mitochondria from the donors egg the resulting baby has DNA from the mother and father as usual plus a small amount of genetic material  about 37 genes  from the donor

The process has led to the phrase threeparent babies though more than 998 of the DNA in the babies comes from the mother and father

The UK is not the first country to use the MDT technique In 2016 a US doctor announced the worlds first MDT birth after treating a Jordanian woman who carried mitochondrial mutations that cause a fatal condition called Leigh syndrome

Progress with MDT led parliament to change the law in 2015 to permit the procedure Two years later Newcastle Fertility Centre became the first and only national centre licensed to perform it with the first cases approved in 2018 Approval is given on a casebycase basis by the UKs Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority HFEA which has given the green light for at least 30 cases

Mindboggling and infuriating  this is how experts have described the methane leaks a potent greenhouse gas from Turkmenistans major fossil fuel fields

However these leaks can be easily fixed experts say in a move that would rapidly reduce global heating

The western fossil fuel field in the oil and gasrich country of Turkmenistan leaked 26m tonnes of methane in 2022 while the eastern field emitted 18m tonnes according to data produced by Kayrros for the Guardian

Together the two fields released emissions equivalent to 366m tonnes of CO2 more than the UKs annual emissions which are the 17thbiggest in the world

Methane emissions have surged alarmingly since 2007 This acceleration may be the biggest threat to keeping below 15C of global heating and also seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points according to scientists

However tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions and therefore global heating

Have you been watching the coronation of King Charles III 

Depending on your point of view the ceremony can either be viewed as a sacred moment when God confers authority on a new monarch to reign over the people or as a very expensive way to put a big hat on someone who got the position because of who their parents were

After more than seven decades in waiting King Charles III has been crowned in Westminster Abbey by the archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby The St Edwards Crown was placed on the Kings head after a small struggle Its the only time Charles will wear it in his life

In the lavish and archaic ritual not seen in Britain since 1953 the king was anointed with holy oil and swore the oath of kings before his wife Queen Camilla was then presented with the royal sceptre and the rod of equity and mercy and also enthroned

Protest is a fundamental right not a gift from the state

This was the reaction from the Liberty Human Rights group after the head of the UKs leading republican movement and other organisers of an antimonarchist protest at the coronation were arrested on King Charles IIIs procession route

Graham Smith the chief executive of Republic pictured on the last slide had been collecting drinks and placards for demonstrators at the main site of the protest on Trafalgar Square when he was stopped with five others by police on St Martins Lane in central London

Scotland Yard later said several arrests had been made for breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause public disorder adding that lockon devices used by protesters to attach themselves to street furniture had been found The allegation was denied by Republic

It is hard to defend the existence of the Commonwealth in 2023 argues Kenneth Mohammed a writer and Caribbean analyst with a focus on corruption in his last Guardian column before the coronation of King Charles III and in response to the UK PMs shockingly dismissive words on Britains barbaric role in slavery

Citing Philip Murphy a former director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London who called it an irrelevant institution wallowing in imperial amnesia Mohammed writes Its legacy of colonialism and now neocolonialism has undermined its legitimacy and relevance

And with Caribbean countries such as Barbados and Jamaica beginning to break away from the UK Mohammed asks Would a better alternative be for the Caribbean to join Africa and Asia in an economic union or  controversially  the Bric nations Brazil Russia India China and South Africa

Its been a really terrible night for us

This is what Conservative minister Johnny Mercer said to the BBC while Plymouth Council was called for Labour in the background live on air

I think locally it has been very difficult  and we have seen that reflected in the results tonight but you know we take it on the chin said the MP

The local elections have seen a disappointing night for Tories as Labour which is course to take the lead in the total number of councillors for the first time in 20 years make big gains in key England councils  though the Liberal Democrats are also playing a key role in the Conservative decline

These results have been a disaster for Rishi Sunak as voters punish him for the Tories failure said Shabana Mahmood Labours campaign chief

Greg Hands the Conservative party chair told GB News that it has been a disappointing night for his party

Labour claims its English local election gains put it on course for winning the next general election although the party is currently projected to fall short of the 10point lead experts said the Labour leader Keir Starmer would need to feel confident of becoming the next prime minister

So secretive so full of scandal  And yet were supposed to say God save the King

This is what teacher and antimonarchy activist Danni says about why hes been out on the streets drumming up support for a vote on the future of the royal family

As the country gears up for the coronation of King Charles III the scandals and cost of the monarchy has come under greater scrutiny and antimonarchist groups believe that this is their opportunity to get the public on their side

British public support for monarchy at historic low with only three in 10 Britons believing the monarchy is very important  the lowest proportion on record according to a survey by the National Centre for Social Research

But while peaceful protests are planned for coronation day many antimonarchists report having received intimidatory letters by the Home Office saying that new criminal offences to prevent disruption which came into place merely days before King Charles III is crowned including a possible 12 months behind bars for protesters blocking roads and six months for locking onto buildings  have been rushed into law

You cannot kill democracy that easily

In a defiant speech on Wednesday trans politician Zooey Zephyr told Montana Republicans that they would have blood on your hands if they voted to ban genderaffirming medical care for trans children

Zephyr said she was taking a stand for the LGBTQ community her constituents in Missoula and democracy itself

The Montana House Republicans responded by barring Zephyr  a Democratic representative   from the statehouse floor for the rest of the session

Under the terms of the punishment Zephyr will still be able to vote remotely but will be unable to participate in debates on the floor for the remainder of the 90day legislative session

Zephyr had been forbidden from speaking for the past week over her comments which Republicans said violated decorum

If you use decorum to silence people who hold you accountable then all youre doing is using decorum as a tool of oppression Zephyr said

The punishment marks the first time in nearly 50 years that Montana lawmakers have sought such disciplinary action against a colleague

The decision to silence Zephyr had already drawn protests that brought the statehouse to a halt on Monday as demonstrators demanded Zephyr be allowed to speak

The royal links to slavery are more than just institutional they are in the Windsor family heritage

Direct ancestors of King Charles III and the royal family bought and exploited enslaved people on tobacco plantations in Virginia according to new research shared with the Guardian

A document discovered in archives reveals that a direct ancestor of the king was involved in buying at least 200 enslaved people from the Royal African Company RAC in 1686

The RAC which traded almost 180000 enslaved people was granted royal charters by successive English kings In the newly published document senior RAC officials describing themselves as your loving friends instructed the captain of a ship to deliver negroes to Edward Porteus a tobacco plantation owner in Virginia and two other men 

Porteuss son Robert inherited his fathers estate before moving his family to England in 1720 Later a direct descendant Frances Smith married the aristocrat Claude BowesLyon Their granddaughter was Elizabeth BowesLyon the late queen mother

The documents establishing these royal roots were found by the researcher Desire Baptiste while investigating links between the Church of England and enslavers in Virginia for a play she has written This means the royal links to slavery are more than just institutional they are in the Windsor family heritage Baptiste said

A palace spokesperson said that they were unable to comment until after the coronation  adding that the media operation was under intense pressure dealing with global interest in the coronation

Earlier this month in response to the Guardians reporting as part of our new series Cost of the crown Charles signalled for the first time his support for research into the links between the British monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade

We need some more humanity in this debate said Scottish MP Stephen Flynn to Rishi Sunak during prime ministers questions

The SNPs Westminster leader was pressing the PM on whether there were any safe or legal routes to the UK for children fleeing the war in Sudan  and whether his government intends to detain and deport Sudanese child refugees who come to the UK

Sunak said that the government had spent 250m on aid to Sudan in the past five years

The UN refugee agency estimates that around 270000 refugees will try to flee over Sudans borders to escape from the escalating violence between the Sudanese army and Rapid Support Force RSF which UN SecretaryGeneral Antnio Guterres warns could cause immense suffering for years

A temporary and fragile truce between the two sides is expected to hold until Thursday night providing civilians a chance to escape the conflict But there are many questions Sudanese people are having to ask themselves as they weigh up whether to leave their homes  and what awaits them if they do To read our new explainer click the link in bio

Rupert Murdochs media business secretly paid Prince William a very large sum of money to quietly settle a phonehacking claim according to new court filings

The Prince of Wales is said to have received the previously undisclosed payment in 2020 after bringing a legal claim against the owner of the Sun and the News of the World

The claim was made in legal documents submitted by his brother Prince Harry as part of his own legal battle with the publisher which returned to the high court today

Harry told the court his attempts to seek an apology from Murdochs company over phone hacking were carried out with the approval of his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II

The royal claims there was a secret agreement struck between royal family and senior executives at Murdochs company at some point before 2012 As part of this supposed deal the princes would delay legal proceedings against the newspaper group in return for receiving an apology at a later date

Harry said the royal family did this after being scarred by the Tampongate incident when the Sun obtained a recorded phone call between Prince Charles and Camilla while the couple were having an affair in the 1980s

A spokesperson for the company said the Sun does not accept liability or make any admissions to the allegations emphasising that many of Harrys claims dated back 20 years

Countries around the world have ramped up efforts to evacuate their citizens staff and diplomats from Sudan while thousands of people remain trapped amid deadly fighting in the northeastern African nation

The UK Germany Italy Jordan and Canada were among those to begin evacuations as fighting continues between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group with a series of ceasefires failing to hold

The death toll in Sudan has passed 420 including 264 civilians and more than 3700 have been wounded according to local and international NGOs However most analysts believe the true total of fatalities and injuries after more than nine days of fighting is much higher

There was anger on the battered streets of the capital Khartoum where thousands remain trapped in the escalating conflict

They evacuated their people  the Americans do not care about Sudan  The safety of their people is a priority for them we should not concentrate on that we should think of ways to stop the war said Madji Ebaid 61 a businessman

Alaa Mustafa a 33yearold hospital lab assistant in Omdurman said the evacuation by western countries showed that at least politicians in London or Washington cared about their citizens

Our leader might stop fighting but imagine only allowing the westerners to leave the country What about us who are still here There are so many humanitarian cases and people who need emergency care Their bodies are thrown on the streets

On Monday afternoon the UN secretary general Antnio Guterres warned that the situation could engulf the whole region He called for a ceasefire and said that humanitarian aid workers should be allowed in by both sides

We hoped Stephens death would be the catalyst for real change but the assurances proved hollow That explains the policing crisis today writes Imran Khan the lawyer for Stephen Lawrences family

It has been 30 years since Stephen Lawrence was killed in a racist attack as he made his way home with a friend in southeast London

The response from the police was found to have been marred by institutional racism and a failure of leadership

The campaigning led by Lawrences family and activists led to a profound and lasting impact on attitudes towards race in Britain

Why are Americans being shot for knocking on the wrong door

Within a week there have been four unrelated shooting incidents where the victims made simple mistakes such as knocking on the wrong door or trying to get into the wrong car

Its hard to pinpoint the reasons why things have taken such a dire turn writes Guardian US columnist Francine Prose 

The increase in gun violence has put us all on edge An uptick in impulsive explosive triggerhappy rage ramps up the fear and paranoia that has us warily eyeing our fellow passengers and shoppers

These cases have also revived concerns about stand your ground and other expanding selfdefense laws Castle doctrine laws in the US have long allowed people to kill intruders threatening their homes but standyourground policies extended that selfdefense concept to the wider public sphere  with deadly consequences

By 2012 24 states had versions of stand your ground And now 38 states have similar statutes or equivalent legal precedents according to a 2022 Reveal investigation

Robin Buller was just under six weeks pregnant when she began to have heavy bleeding and agonizing stabs of pain on her right side After rushing to the emergency department an ultrasound confirmed her pregnancy had been ectopic meaning it had implanted outside the uterus

In simpler terms I was going to have an abortion and it was going to save my life Buller writes

She was relieved that she didnt live in one of the 13 states that have banned abortion since Roe v Wade was overturned last year However living in California didnt shield her from other brutal features of American healthcare

I was not exempt from the fact that in the US receiving abortion care  or any medical care  can be extremely expensive she writes

At the end of it all I was billed over 55000 a number that felt unfathomable for someone who grew up in Canada where under a publicly funded health system an emergency abortion or any abortion for that matter would yield no cost to an insured patient

After her private health insurance plan paid its part she owed over 8000 for a procedure without which she might have died

And as it turns out Im not alone One New York woman was charged 80000 for services related to the termination of an ectopic pregnancy  again in a state with liberal abortion laws

Even in nonemergency situations abortions in the US are expensive Typically where abortion care is legal it costs between several hundred and several thousand dollars At a nonprofit like Planned Parenthood abortion costs range from 550800 At a hospital or private clinic price tags can be much higher

Truth matters

Fox News and the voting equipment company Dominion have reached a 7875m settlement ending a dispute over whether Fox knowingly broadcast false and outlandish allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election

Though the case was settled Dominion had unearthed a stunning trove of internal communications from Fox laying bare how top talent and hosts knew the outlandish claims about Dominion and a stolen election were false 

The extensive messages offered a remarkable insight into how some of the most powerful hosts in America did not buy the allegations they were broadcasting to their audience each night

Neither party immediately disclosed the terms of the settlement other than the dollar amount and attorneys for Dominion declined to answer questions about whether it requires Fox to issue a retraction or a formal apology

In a press conference outside the courthouse Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said the more than 787m represents vindication and accountability

Truth matters he said Lies have consequences The truth does not know red or blue he continued People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues even of the most profound importance But for our democracy to endure another 250 years and hopefully much longer we must share a commitment to facts

In a statement Fox said the settlement reflects its continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards

We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial allows the country to move forward from these issues the statement said

At least 185 people have been killed and and more than 1800 injured since Saturday when violence erupted between army units loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah alBurhan the head of Sudans transitional governing sovereign council and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as Hemedti who is deputy head of the council

Widespread international outrage has erupted in response to the shooting of 16yearold Black teenager Ralph Yarl in Missouri and the subsequent police response

White homeowner Andrew Lester 84 has been charged with armed assault after he shot Yarl a high school junior who was going to pick up his younger twin brothers from a play date when he went to the wrong address by mistake authorities announced on Monday

Zachary Thompson the prosecuting attorney announced the charges later that day after intense local protests over the polices decision to briefly detain Lester before releasing him without charges

Yarl was recovering at home after being released from hospital on Sunday where he was being treated for gunshot wounds to his head and chest his family said

Lee Merritt an attorney for the family told the Guardian that the teenager suffered a fractured skull a traumatic brain injury involving swelling postconcussive syndrome and injuries to his arm

The family is elated that Ralph didnt succumb to his injuries but now theyre angry about the failure of the justice system to show any value or appreciation of his life Merritt said in an interview before the charges were announced

The prominent civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump is also representing the family and earlier told CNN It is inescapable not to observe the racial dynamics here  We can only imagine if the roles were reversed 

Stacey Graves chief of the Kansas City police defended the release of the unnamed homeowner on Sunday citing Missouri law that states a person can be held for only 24 hours before being formally charged or released She said her department was working quickly to prepare evidence for the Clay county prosecutor as its felony investigation continued

We recognise the frustration this can cause Graves told reporters I want everyone to know that I am listening and I understand the concern we are receiving from the community

He said this was a historic moment as it was the first time an AI image had won a prestigious international photography competition adding How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated Something about this doesnt feel right does it

AI images and photography should not compete with each other in an award like this They are different entities AI is not photography Therefore I will not accept the award

Eldagsen suggested donating the prize to a photo festival hosted in Odesa Ukraine

At least 97 people have been killed and hundreds wounded as clashes spread across Sudan and the World Health Organization WHO said some hospitals were running out of critical supplies to treat the injured

Fighting erupted over the weekend between army units loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah alBurhan the head of Sudans transitional governing Sovereign Council and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces RSF led by Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo known as Hemedti who is deputy head of the council

It was the first such outbreak of fighting since both groups joined forces to oust the veteran Islamist autocrat Omar alBashir in 2019

The violence was sparked by a disagreement over the integration of the RSF into the military as part of a transition towards civilian rule to end the politicaleconomic crisis sparked by a military coup in 2021

The super bloom is back  but not everyone is super excited by it 

After a string of dry years people are once again descending on orangesaturated valleys across California and Arizona for a glimpse of the wild poppies

The flowers are having a strong showing this year following a historically wet winter in the southwest US In some regions you can even see the bright blankets of flowers from space

The spectacle set off a frenzy four years ago when heavy winter rains coated huge swaths of land in the wildflowers leading to a crush of tourists influencers selfies and environmental complaints

The flowers were beautiful the scene was a nightmare said Lake Elsinores mayor Natasha Johnson in a February press conference where she announced the closure of the canyon where the poppies were starting to grow

This year there are calls for a greater awareness around the impact of such tourism

I dont think it has to be this way where we have to cordon off nature from humans We can have a more positive relationship says Dr Naomi Fraga the director of conservation at the California Botanic Garden 

This is a natural ecosystem she adds It is not just for pulling likes and clicks and endorphins If an educational voice can be a louder voice than the influencers that could do a lot of good
Everything that happens on abortion happens in Alabama first

Dr Leah Torres doesnt tell people what she does when she meets them which makes it hard to make friends She removes her name from every piece of trash before she puts it out for recycling in case people walking past see her name and find out where she lives If a package addressed to her arrives on her porch she calls everyone she knows to identify who sent it before she opens it  it could be a bomb

Shes not paranoid Torres is an abortion doctor in the state of Alabama where abortion is now illegal except in lifethreatening situations

How worried should we be about having TikTok on our phones

The app which has more than 1 billion global users has been under increasing scrutiny over its links to China and ability to protect data

TikTok bans on government phones are piling up across the world with Australia the latest country to pull the plug while plans to completely ban the platform in the US are on the horizon The app has also been fined 127m for UK data protection law breaches including the use of the personal data of children under 13 without parental consent

But what does this actually mean for everyday TikTok users Our UK technology editor Alex Hern explains the security fears surrounding TikTok and whether they mean we should all be deleting the app

A TikTok spokesperson said recent government bans were based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics in which the app played no part We remain committed to working with governments and partners to address any security concerns but ask to be judged on facts not fears and treated equally to our competitors they said

Exclusive millions of lives could be saved by a groundbreaking set of new vaccines for a range of conditions including cancer experts have said

A leading pharmaceutical firm said it is confident that jabs for cancer cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases and other conditions will be ready by 2030

Studies into these vaccinations are also showing tremendous promise with some researchers saying 15 years worth of progress has been unspooled in 12 to 18 months thanks to the success of the Covid jab

Dr Paul Burton the chief medical officer of pharmaceutical company Moderna said he believes the firm will be able to offer such treatments for all sorts of disease areas in as little as five years

The firm which created one of the leading coronavirus vaccines is developing cancer vaccines that target different tumour types

Burton said We will have that vaccine and it will be highly effective and it will save many hundreds of thousands if not millions of lives I think we will be able to offer personalised cancer vaccines against multiple different tumour types to people around the world

He also said that multiple respiratory infections could be covered by a single injection  allowing vulnerable people to be protected against Covid flu and respiratory syncytial virus RSV  while mRNA therapies could be available for rare diseases for which there are currently no drugs

Republicans in Tennessee have been accused of overt racism after expelling two Black Democrats from the state legislature 

In an act of unprecedented retaliation Republicans removed the two lawmakers for joining a gun control protest following the Nashville shooting while sparing a white Democrat who also participated

Justin Jones representative for Nashville and Justin Pearson who represented Memphis gave rousing speeches in the chamber before the majoritywhite legislature voted to oust them leaving tens of thousands of mostly Black and Brown Tennessee residents without representation

Justin Jones 27 said he had no regrets and would continue to speak up for Tennesseans who are demanding change

What happened yesterday was an attack on our democracy and overt racism he said The nation got to see clearly whats going on in Tennessee that we dont have democracy especially when it comes to Black and Brown communities This is what we have been challenging all session a very toxic racist work environment

Jones said Republican lawmakers were trying to take Tennessee backwards and pointed to the states history of white supremacy the birthplace of the ultraviolent Ku Klux Klan

Meanwhile Gloria Johnson the white Democrat spared expulsion by a onevote margin was asked by reporters about the split vote as she left the chamber on Thursday

Ill answer your question it might have to do with the color of our skin said Johnson a retired teacher

Republican lawmakers denied allegations of racism and said the expulsions were necessary to avoid setting a precedent that lawmakers disruptions of proceedings through protest would be tolerated

When I found out I was HSP it truly changed and saved my life tweeted comedian Miranda Hart

The term Highly Sensitive Person HSP was coined in 1996 by psychologist Elaine Aron who argued that sensitive brains are uniquely wired to process their environment at a deep level

Her theorys most striking claim is that physical and emotional sensitivity are one and the same An intricate attention to body language heightens empathy responsiveness to subtle physical cues creates rich sensations in HSPs but can also overwhelm Scratchy clothes smells background talk  unable to filter the noise they soak up every drop

These names are a fragment of the whole picture

Attempting to trace all the human beings enslaved and forced to work on the sugar and cotton plantations that lined the pockets of the Manchester Guardians founders is complex and building a full picture of their lives is near impossible

As Dr Cassandra Gooptar who conducted this research writes The historically whitewashed narrative of Britains legacy of slavery and colonialism tended to treat the enslaved as a distant abstract construct or statistic in a distant land

The effort to tell a different story  in an attempt to restore dignity and humanity  involves relying on sources that were not compiled with dignity in mind such as lists of confiscated property or contraband after the US civil war or newspaper ads placed to find runaways with crude descriptions of ethnicity age or characteristics as well as bills of sales The ages are often written as approximate and the names may not have been of their own choosing

This is in memory of them

Would you live in a microapartment 

Our Tokyo correspondent Justin McCurry spent a night in one of the citys microapartments and was quite surprised by how cosy it is

The tiny homes measure just nine square metres  just under half the size of a typical studio apartment in the city  and our growing in popularity in Tokyo but why

They are cheap rents for microapartments can be as low as 50000 376 311 a month rising to 80000 in more fashionable locations

This is why many young people who are unable to afford the capitals high and rising rents are living in these tiny homes

But critics say the microapartments boom highlights the lack of affordable urban housing for young underpaid workers with quality of life sacrificed for convenience and affordability

What do you think of this kissing device

A Chinese startup has invented a longdistance kissing machine that transmits users kiss data collected through motion sensors hidden in silicon lips which simultaneously move when replaying kisses received

MUA  named after the sound people commonly make when blowing a kiss  also captures and replays sound and warms up slightly during kissing making the experience more authentic said Beijingbased Siweifushe

Users can even download kissing data submitted via an accompanying app by other users The invention was inspired by lockdown isolation At their most severe Chinas lockdowns saw authorities forbid residents to leave their apartments for months on end

I was in a relationship back then but I couldnt meet my girlfriend due to lockdowns said inventor Zhao Jianbo

Then a student at the Beijing Film Academy he focused his graduate project on the lack of physical intimacy in video calls He later set up Siweifushe which released MUA its first product on 22 January The device is priced at 260 yuan 38

In the two weeks after its release the firm sold over 3000 kissing machines and received about 20000 orders he said

The MUA resembles a mobile stand with colourless pursed lips protruding from the front To use it lovers must download an app on to their smartphones and pair their kissing machines When they kiss the device it kisses back

It has received mixed reviews with some users saying it was intriguing while others said it made them feel uncomfortable Among the top complaints was its lack of tongue

Some commentators on social media site Weibo also expressed concern that the device could be used for online erotic content which is strictly regulated in China

Zhao said his company complies with regulations but that theres little we can do as for how people use the device

The force has had almost 30 years to put its house in order It has not done so either because it does not want to or it does not know how to

On 22 April 1993 Stephen Lawrence an 18yearold aspiring architect was stabbed to death by a gang of racists in an unprovoked attack in southeast London

In 1999 the Macpherson inquiry concluded that institutional racism contributed to the Metropolitan polices failure to bring Stephens attackers to justice In 2012 two men were jailed for murder but others remain free

Now more than 20 years later a new landmark report by Louise Casey released today has found that the capitals police force has institutional problems with racism misogyny and homophobia

In response to the damning findings Lady Lawrence Stephens mother said It comes as no surprise to me that the report  has found that the Metropolitan police is riddled with deepseated racism sexism and homophobia My suspicion that racism played a critical part in the failure of the Metropolitan police to properly investigate my sons death in 1993 was borne out by the Macpherson report

Since then despite repeated reassurances that the Metropolitan police had learned lessons from its failures discrimination in every form is clearly rampant in its ranks

Lady Caseys report was commissioned after the abduction rape and murder of Sarah Everard in 2021 by serving firearms officer Wayne Couzens

The 363page report leaves no stone unturned addressing the culture of bullying and harassment and senior leaderships inability to adequately address the mounting number of scandals within Britains biggest police force

I am scared of the police I dont trust my own organisation

This is how one openly gay police officer describes being left feeling at the hands of his colleagues after being the target of a sustained campaign of homophobia He says he joined the Metropolitan police  Britains largest force  to be there for the people who need us

His is just one of the alarming stories to emerge from the damning Casey review which has exposed the institutional racism misogyny and homophobia and inside the capitals police force

The 363page report details disturbing testimonies from officers on banter culture humiliation of junior staff being urinated on in the showers to the shocking and deeprooted mistreatment and abuse of LGBTQ female Black Asian and minority ethnic officers

Multiple officers also report their treatment only for their cases to be ignored and dismissed by a system the report describes as having a culture of denial

One female officer who the report says was a victim of domestic and sexual abuse at the hands of a fellow Met officer during a longterm relationship and who was so distraught at the forces handling of the case that she attempted suicide was told days after Sarah Everards murder that her case was not being taken forward

The Met was coming out saying we hate violence against women and girls we stand against this and I was thinking no you dont It made me rage Did I need to die in order for you to take me seriously the officer said in the Casey report

It feels like a lonely place trying to forge this change and a better Met

Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has said that he is embarrassed by the findings and that he accepted Caseys factual findings about racism misogyny and homophobia in his organisation and they were systemic but neither he nor the Met would accept they were institutional claiming it was a political term

This is the final warning from scientists on the climate crisis

The message was delivered as the final part of the UNs sixpart climate report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC and took hundreds of scientists eight years to compile and runs to thousands of pages

The IPCC set out the devastation that has already been inflicted on swathes of the world

Extreme weather caused by climate breakdown has led to increased deaths from intensifying heatwaves in all regions millions of lives and homes destroyed in droughts and floods millions of people facing hunger and increasingly irreversible losses in vital ecosystems

Todays report is almost certain to be the last such assessment while the world still has a chance of limiting global temperature rises to 15C above preindustrial levels the threshold beyond which our damage to the climate will rapidly become irreversible

More than 300 people were arrested across France last night during spontaneous protests against a decision by the president Emmanuel Macron to bypass parliament and force through unpopular pension changes including raising the retirement age from 62 to 64

Macron instructed the prime minister lisabeth Borne to invoke article 493 of the constitution which allows the government to adopt a bill without a parliamentary vote because he said there was too much economic risk to the country if MPs voted against the bill

As opposition politicians accused the government of a brutal and undemocratic approach demonstrators gathered in Paris and other cities About 200 protesters briefly blocked traffic on the Paris ring road early on Friday morning

These protests occurred against a backdrop of two months of coordinated nationwide strikes and some of the biggest protests in decades including a bin collectors strike in Paris during which waste piled high in the streets

Unions immediately called for another day of mass strikes and protests for next Thursday calling the governments move a complete denial of democracy

Opposition parties will call a vote of no confidence in the government on Monday

The international criminal court in The Hague has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and his childrens rights commissioner Maria Alekseyevna LvovaBelova for the unlawful deportation of Ukrainian children

The courts pretrial judges assessed there were reasonable grounds to believe that each suspect bears responsibility for the war crime of unlawful deportation of population and that of unlawful transfer of population from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation in prejudice of Ukrainian children

The judges considered issuing secret warrants but decided that making them public could contribute to the prevention of the further commission of crimes

Hope is our biggest currency right now

The 2023 presidential election in Nigeria saw a marked rise in engagement by young people many of whom rallied around the outsider candidate Peter Obi who stood for the Labour party

The vote was largely peaceful but the turnout was low  just 27 a figure blamed in part on millions of Nigerians being unable to cast a ballot The slow tallying of results angered voters and opposition parties who allege voterigging

Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress was declared the winner The former vicepresident Atiku Abubakar 76 of the opposition Peoples Democratic party came second and Obi third The ruling party denied manipulating results

Last week the electoral commission said it was pushing back polling to elect state governors due to problems with the digital voting system experienced in the presidential vote on 25 February

Obi is now contesting the result in the countrys highest court of appeal The Labour party candidate who for many especially young voters represented hope for change said the election will go down as one of the most controversial elections ever conducted in Nigeria

We spoke to five young Nigerians about how they felt about last months election the results and their hopes for the future

This star is 30 times as big as our sun  and this image captures the rare and fleeting phase of it on the cusp of death

The observation was among the first made by the James Webb space telescope following its launch in late 2021 but the picture was not released until this week

This star in the constellation Sagitta officially known as WR 124 already has shed enough material to account for 10 suns according to Nasa

Webbs infrared eyes observed all the gas and dust flung into space by a huge hot star 15000 light years away A light year is about 58tn miles

Shimmering in purple like a cherry blossom the castoff material once comprised the stars outer layer The Hubble space telescope snapped a shot of the same transitioning star a few decades ago but it appeared more like a fireball without the delicate details

Such a transformation occurs only with some stars and normally is the last step before they explode going supernova according to scientists

It reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday after sweeping through Mozambique Malawis government said at least 190 people were killed with 584 injured and 37 missing while authorities in neighbouring Mozambique reported 20 deaths and 24 injured

Many people died in mudslides that washed away homes in the countrys commercial capital Blantyre

Leaked messages seen by the Guardian show the BBC coming under pressure from No 10 over the corporations political reporting

Emails and messages were shown to the Guardian amid concern among some BBC insiders that the corporation has been too cowed by the government in recent years

The messages seen by the Guardian date from 2020 to 2022 asked their journalists to avoid using the word lockdown at the start of the pandemic and to be more critical of Labour after pressure from Downing Street

These new statistics reveal the staggering scale of violence against women and girls and have deeply worrying implications for womens already low levels of trust in the criminal justice system says Farah Nazeer the chief executive of Womens Aid

According to new data from the National Police Chiefs Council NPCC overall 1483 unique allegations were reported against 1539 police officers  or 07 of the workforce These included 1177 cases of alleged policeperpetrated violence including sexual harassment and assault reported between October 2021 and April 2022

Just over half the cases were conduct matters which are usually raised by a colleague within the force The remaining cases were complaints from the public

The deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth the National Police Chiefs Council coordinator for violence against women and girls said she wanted to see more officers investigated disciplined and sacked for crimes and misconduct against women and girls

She said the figures reinforce the urgency and importance of our current mission to lift the stones and root abusers and corrupt individuals out of policing The vast majority of officers and staff are professional and committed but I know it is shocking to hear about any potential predators in policing and that this can further shake fragile trust

She added that the data was from a year ago and therefore did not reflect work done over the past 18 months to identify wrongdoing strengthen misconduct investigations and toughen sanctions She said she hoped that future iterations would show the impact of those changes including giving more women the confidence to report concerns

Publishing an annual assessment of police performance is a new step taken by the NPCC and College of Policing to improve responses to violence against women and girls and to tackle rampant sexism and misogyny in the force

The moves are part of efforts to tackle misogyny in policing after scandals including the case of David Carrick a former police officer who was found to be a prolific sex offender and the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer

Methane emissions cause 25 of global heating today and there has been a scary surge since 2007 according to scientists This acceleration may be the biggest threat to keeping below 15C of global heating and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points researchers say

What were seeing here is segregation

The worst 10 hotspots for fine particle air pollution in the US have been revealed by the Guardian in an analysis using cuttingedge modelling

The findings show that across the contiguous US the neighborhoods burdened by the worst pollution are overwhelmingly the same places where Black and Hispanic populations live Race is more of a predictor of air pollution exposure than income level researchers have found

What were seeing here is segregation said Julian Marshall one of the researchers who helped create the computer model You have segregation of people and segregation of pollution

The fine particles of air pollution emitted by cars factories wildfires and dusty agricultural activities known to researchers as PM25 are small enough to travel deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream increasing death rates from causes like respiratory disease heart attacks and strokes

New research is showing they are associated with a surprising array of health impacts ranging from miscarriages and Covid19 to kidney damage and blood infections

More than 2m households fell into fuel poverty last year and in one community in northeast England a group of women are pulling together amidst the deepening cost of living crisis to make sure everyone is supported

The Guardian spent a week with volunteers at Shiremoor North Tyneside  a centre which doubles as a warm bank  a space where people can go to heat up for free if they cant afford to turn on the heating in their home 

The team are getting requests for food period products blankets and seeing families forced to choose between heating and eating everyday But it comes at a cost according to the founder Janine who says they are close to breaking point

The picture of us that is being drawn by government and far right is very saddening The world needs to understand that we are human and should be treated like humans

This is what a 20yearold asylum seeker who recently left Home Office accommodation in Kent said about the governments proposed new legislation which will see asylum seekers arriving in the UK via small boats detained and deported

Unveiling the plans to Conservatives Braverman admitted the illegal migration bill was more than 50 likely to break human rights laws

Braverman and Rishi Sunak have claimed the measures will successfully deter people from crossing the Channel However neither the home secretary nor the prime minister have been able to set out details on new detention facilities to accommodate the detained refugees or when people will be able to be deported to Rwanda

Were not breaking the law and no government representative has said that were breaking the law Braverman told Sky News on Wednesday

The UN refugee agency said it was profoundly concerned by the bills provisions which would give the government the right to criminalise detain and deport asylum seekers saying it would be a clear breach of the refugee convention

Rights groups politicians and charities have also been quick to condemn the immigration bill

Seeking asylum is not a crime and those forced to flee their homes deserve compassion dignity and the right to fair treatment Conflict and persecution do not exist only within the confines of countries that the UK government deems worthy of a visa scheme said Katy Chakrabortty head of policy and advocacy at Oxfam GB

In 2022 45755 men women and children crossed the Channel in small boats to reach the UK most of whom then claimed asylum Nearly 3000 people have already made the crossing this year with official estimates expecting more than 80000 this year

It started three months ago when girls in the Iranian city of Qom reported a strange smell of tangerines at their school Some began to experience trouble breathing nausea and numbness Eighteen of them were taken to hospital They appeared to have been poisoned

Today the number of girls with symptoms in similar circumstances stands at more than 1104 in 15 cities across the country

Last week as dozens more schoolgirls were admitted to hospital the Iranian government acknowledged the events for the first time

Many believe that the suspected attacks are part of an extremist response  perhaps with tacit state endorsement  to the protests led by women and girls that have convulsed Iran since the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022

But there are also suggestions that some of the cases may be evidence of mass sociogenic illness  symptoms without a biomedical cause  triggered by the repression of schoolgirls who have played a leading role in that movement

With teenagers systematically targeted by the security services for their part in the protests there were new protests in Tehran over the weekend over a perceived escalation in the threat to the countrys children  and more hospital admissions

23003 people died in England during 2022 after spending at least 12 hours in an AE waiting for care or to be admitted to a bed according to analysis of NHS figures by emergency care doctors

The Royal College of Emergency Medicine RCEM says that equates to roughly one death every 23 minutes 63 every day 442 a week or 1917 each month

The college said its findings while shocking were also unsurprising and reflected the fact that emergency departments are often overwhelmed and unable to find patients a bed in the hospital

NHS England disputed the RCEMs findings but did not indicate how many avoidable deaths it thinks are occurring due to AE delays

The cause of excess deaths is down to a number of different factors and so attributing deaths to one exact thing as the figures quoted by the RCEM attempt to do is very unlikely to give a full or certain picture a spokesperson said

It therefore would not be appropriate for NHSE to recognise these as fact and it is right that the experts at the ONS  as the executive branch of the statistics authority  continue to analyse excess deaths

The data highlighted looks at time in AE rather than waits and covers a year when the NHS experienced four recordbreaking months for attendances in AE

Rosie Cooper the Liberal Democrats health spokesperson said patients are now dying in their droves due to successive Conservative governments neglecting the NHS and added that the lives lost due to AE snarlups constituted a national disaster

It has been warning since last September that up to 500 deaths have been occurring every week in AEs in England because so many patients have spent so long there  a claim the NHS denies

Exceptionally low tides and a lack of rain in Venice has left some of the citys famous canals almost dry

Weeks of dry winter weather have raised concerns that Italy could face another drought after last summers emergency with the Alps having received less than half of their normal snowfall according to scientists and environmental groups

Venice where flooding is normally the primary concern faces unusually low tides that are making it impossible for gondolas water taxis and ambulances to navigate some of its famous canals

The Po Italys longest river which runs from the Alps in the northwest to the Adriatic has 61 less water than normal at this time of year

Latest weather forecasts do however signal the arrival of muchneeded precipitation and snow in the Alps in coming days

In July last year Italy suffered its worst drought for 70 years and declared a state of emergency in the areas surrounding the Po which accounts for roughly a third of the countrys agricultural production

We are in a water deficit situation that has been building up since the winter of 20202021 climate expert Massimiliano Pasqui was quoted as saying by daily Corriere della SeraWe need 50 days of rain

Believe me every time we tie a balloon my heart hurts

Thats what activist Ogun Sever Okur said as his team of volunteers tied red balloons to rubble in the Hatay province of Turkey

Each red balloon is in honour of a child who died in the earthquake that has killed more than 45000 people across Turkey and Syria

It was announced yesterday that Turkey ended rescue efforts in all but two provinces a fortnight on from the deadly earthquake which is the worst disaster in the countrys modern history

Efforts however will continue in the cities of Antakya and Kahmaranmara which were rendered largely uninhabitable by the 78 magnitude quake which killed more than 41000 people in southern Turkey and at least 4000 more in neighbouring Syria

In Antakya rescue teams continued to pore over rubble during the weekend rescuing a man and a woman who had survived for 13 days The couples three children perished

Hopes of finding more survivors are close to zero as officials now turn to how to repair the devastation that has forced millions of people from their homes

Freedom and Death to the Dictator

These were the words protesters in Iran were heard repeating as they marched through the streets of multiple cities in the most widespread demonstrations in weeks online videos appear to show on Friday

The demonstrations overnight on Thursday marked 40 days since Iran executed Mohammad Mahdi Karami and Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini on charges related to protests that began last year

Videos showed demonstrations in Irans capital Tehran as well as in the cities of Arak Isfahan Izeh in Khuzestan province and Karaj the group Human Rights Activists in Iran said

In Irans western Kurdish regions online videos shared by the Hengaw Organisation for Human Rights showed burning roadblocks in Sanandaj which has seen repeated demonstrations since Aminis death

Many of the videos had been blurred or showed grainy nighttime scenes

The initial unrest  which began in September after the death of 22yearold Mahsa Amini three days after her arrest by morality police  morphed into one of the most serious challenges to Irans theocracy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution

What are my parents doing Have they all been rescued

This is what Mustafa Avci said on the phone to his relatives from hospital after being rescued from the rubble in Hatay Turkey more than 260 hours after the deadly earthquake first hit

Avci is one of the survivors who continue to be pulled from the ruins by rescue workers in southern Turkey 10 days after the quake including a 17yearold girl in Antakya and 74yearold woman in Kahramanmara

The death toll from the earthquake has neared 42000 across Syria and Turkey as officials fear thousands of victims are yet to be found

As hopes of finding further survivors dwindle and as sub zero temperatures force some rescue teams to wind down their efforts for many grief has turned to anger

Survivors in Turkey are criticising the countrys lax building standards which they say are as much to blame for the death toll as the tremor itself while local officials in northern Syria say the aid they need dwarfs the amount of relief being received with large numbers of people having no shelter or protection against the winter

You dont know what were going through

A white supremacist who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo New York last year was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday after listening to relatives of his victims express their pain and rage

The sentencing hearing for Payton Gendron was disrupted when he was charged at by a man in the audience who was quickly restrained It resumed after about 10 minutes with more emotional testimony from people who talked about losing loved ones in the attack

The disruption in the sentencing hearing happened as Barbara Massey Mapps excoriated Gendron for killing her 72yearold sister Katherine Massey As Mapps shouted and pointed at Gendron a person in the audience took a few steps toward him before getting held back

You dont know what were going through the man shouted as he was led away by court officers The court said it will not take legal action against the man

19yearold Gendron wore bulletresistant armor and a helmet equipped with a livestreaming camera as he carried out the 14 May attack with a semiautomatic rifle purchased legally but modified so he could load it with illegal highcapacity ammunition magazines

There were only three survivors after he shot 13 people The victims ranged in age from 32 to 86

This is just wild

A Guardian investigation has revealed that AI tools rate photos of women as more sexually suggestive than those of men especially if nipples pregnant bellies or exercise is involved

Gianluca Mauro gianlucamauro and Hilke Schellmann hilkes used AI tools developed by large technology companies including Google and Microsoft to analyze hundreds of photos of men and women

They found evidence that the AI tags photos of women in everyday situations as sexually suggestive They also rate pictures of women as more racy or sexually suggestive than comparable pictures of men

As a result the social media companies that leverage these or similar algorithms have suppressed the reach of countless images featuring womens bodies and hurt femaleled businesses  further amplifying social disparities

Did you choose to watch the footage that was published of Tyre Nichols fatal beating by a group of Memphis police officers

Dr Riana Elyse Anderson decided not to watch the video because she wanted to preserve her mental health

Shes an expert in racial trauma and explains that watching police brutality videos can trigger PTSDlike trauma for Black viewers

Research shows that exposure to frequent violence against people that look like you causes negative stress reactions this is called vicarious trauma Even though you arent directly experiencing the violence watching the disturbing video secondhand can still trigger a trauma response

This was something that Dr Anderson experienced in 2016 after watching a video showing the fatal shooting of Philando Castile a Black Minnesota motorist by a police officer left her so traumatised that she was left in a catatonic state unable to move for 45 minutes

At times like this watching viral violent videos of police brutality might feel unavoidable  but Dr Anderson encourages you to not feel pressured by anyone else to view certain footage

Soaring inflation climatedriven disasters and war  to name a few current crisis  inflicted untold hardship on hundreds of millions of people across the world in 2022

At the same time on an unprecedented scale the year was the most lucrative for the fossil fuel industry the five largest western oil and gas companies alone made a combined 200bn in profits

Shell recently announced a record annual profit of 40bn 33bn driven by the high energy prices resulting from Russias war in Ukraine

As greenpeaceuk pointed out on Twitter even by earning 40000 per day every day for the past 2026 years roughly how long ago Jesus is said to have been born you would earn 296bn

Shell has suffered a flurry of recent legal and regulatory challenges which includes a Dutch court order to cut emissions from its oil and gas by 45 by 2030 Shell is appealing the verdict

Today its been revealed that the directors of the oil giant Shell are being personally sued over their climate strategy which the claimants say is inadequate to meet climate targets and puts the company at risk as the world switches to clean energy

Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have filed the lawsuit against the 11 directors at the high court in England It is the first case in the world seeking to hold corporate directors liable for failing to properly prepare their company for the net zero transition ClientEarth said

Shell may be making record profits now but the writing is on the wall for fossil fuels long term said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson

A Shell spokesperson said We do not accept ClientEarths allegations Our directors have complied with their legal duties and have at all times acted in the best interests of the company We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious 15C goal of the Paris agreement

Because of you 222 children have gone missing from government facilities

This is what activist Alaska Harrison said when immigration minister Robert Jenrick tried to speak at a Conservative party fundraiser in London

The 10 social justice activists from Green New Deal Rising an organisation that campaigns for climate and social justice posed as Tory loyalists and demanded to know what happened to asylumseeking children who have gone missing from hotels

More activists popped up from the audience variously accusing the government of acting inhumanely and also failing victims of the Windrush scandal One activist called on both the home secretary Suella Braverman and Jenrick to resign immediately

Fatima Ibrahim codirector of Green New Deal Rising said Those who stand for justice stand against this government and the rhetoric and actions they use to demonise people who are simply seeking safety We believe it is the responsibility of our government to provide safety for people facing impossible situations

A source close to Jenrick said Last night the minister spoke about and fielded questions on a wide range of issues including the contribution of the Windrush generation and asylumseeking children It is a shame that these individuals refused to engage in a grown up conversation

The serial rapist and former Metropolitan police officer David Carrick has been sentenced to more than 30 years in prison

He used his status as a Metropolitan police officer to commit 48 rapes amid a spree of 85 serious offences against 12 women

Sentencing him at Southwark crown court this afternoon Mrs Justice Cheema Grubb told Carrick he would serve a total of 36 life sentences with 30 years and 209 days to be served before the parole board can consider releasing him She declined to impose a wholelife order saying the threshold had not been met

The 48yearolds offending was so prolific that he is one of the worst sex offenders in modern British legal history and the scandal has rocked the Met which missed the rapist in their ranks despite repeated complaints against him

Most of Carricks crimes took place in Hertfordshire and was against women he met socially or on dating apps or with whom he had a longerterm relationship

In their statements his victims spoke of how they had encountered evil and the court was told Carrick sent one of his victims a photograph of himself with a workissue gun saying Remember I am the boss

The criminal investigation will continue even after he begins his prison sentence with detectives fearing there are more victims who did not come forward to be part of the case they built against Carrick

How many people do you share a Netflix password with

The world of password sharing on the streaming service is soon to be history and the company yesterday accidentally posted guidelines for how they would be cracking down on the practice

Netflix said the mistakenly launched guidelines are being trialled in Chile Peru and Costa Rica had been posted accidentally across its help centre pages including in the US on Wednesday but had since been taken down

Since last year Netflix has been trialling paid sharing in the three countries where an account holder pays for an extra person located outside the account holders home to access the service In Costa Rica the fee is 299 244 a month

To ensure that a Netflix account is not being shared outside of the household where it is registered the trial requires users to connect their viewing device  such as a TV mobile phone or tablet  to the wifi in their home open the Netflix app and watch something on the streaming service at least once every 31 days

Although Netflix has yet to unveil its plans to tackle account sharing worldwide the trial is the closest indication to what a global approach might look like

Netflix which has 230 million subscribers worldwide said last month that account sharing undermines our longterm ability to invest in and improve Netflix

However as one Twitter user pointed out they havent always thought this Netflix tweeted in 2017 that love is sharing a password Swipe for more of what a few users had to say on Twitter

These obscene profits are an insult to working families  as households up and down Britain struggle to pay their bills and make ends meet Shell are enjoying a cash bonanza

This was said by Paul Nowak the general secretary of the TUC after Shell reported one of the largest profits in UK corporate history with the surge in energy prices sparked by Russias invasion of Ukraine pushing the oil companys annual takings to 40bn 32bn

Opposition parties and trade unions described Shells bonanza the biggest in its 115 year history as outrageous and accused Rishi Sunak of letting fossil fuel companies off the hook

On Thursday the UK headquartered company confirmed it had paid just 134m in British windfall taxes during 2022 It paid 520m under the EU solidarity contribution  Europes equivalent of the windfall tax

The company was criticised in October when it said it had paid no UK windfall tax up to that point but on Wednesday said it was likely to contribute 500m in 2023

Shell has benefited from a surge in oil prices caused by embargoes on Russian oil imposed since the invasion of Ukraine and Vladimir Putins decision to cut off gas supplies to continental Europe

Sunaks spokesperson said No 10 was aware the public would view Shells profits as extraordinarily high which was why the government had introduced its windfall tax comparable to those seen in other countries he added

The Labour leader said he couldnt quite believe it and urged Rishi Sunak at prime ministers questions on Wednesday to put his foot down and tell Johnson that as he made the mess he can pick up the bill

The Cabinet Office defended the idea of taxpayers footing Johnsons legal advice costs saying There is an established precedent across multiple administrations that former ministers may be supported with legal representation after they have left office when matters relate to their time and conduct as a minister

In our latest Observer investigation we have spoken to a whistleblower who claims children seeking asylum in the UK were threatened and subjected to racist abuse by staff at a Home Officerun hotel

The source who worked in the Brighton hotel for more than a year said that in such an environment of emotional abuse scores of children who had arrived in the UK without parents or a carer were driven on to the streets and into the hands of criminals

Last week our team revealed dozens of young people have been kidnapped by gangs from the same hotel prompting calls for such places to be closed and for a public inquiry More than 200 children are missing after vanishing from hotels managed by the Home Office

Another whistleblower has now come forward claiming that some children in the Brighton hotel were also threatened that their asylum claims would be harmed if they misbehaved while others were punished by being detained  illegally  in the hotel for days

A Home Office spokesperson said We have not received any complaints in relation to these claims The wellbeing of children in our care is an absolute priority Robust safeguards are in place to ensure they are safe and supported as we seek urgent placements with a local authority

Two hundred asylumseeking children who were placed in hotels run by the Home Office have gone missing a minister has admitted

They include one girl and at least 13 children under the age of 16 Simon Murray told the House of Lords yesterday

It comes after the Observer reported a story that seemed to set a new low for the authorities handling of asylum seekers who come to the UK by small boats dozens of vulnerable children with no parent in the country being abducted from outside Home Officerun hotels and disappearing according to a whistleblower from a Home Office hotel in Brighton

And yet that summary only scratches the surface of the policy mess that has left them so at risk

At one hotel alone 79 children are still unaccounted for

In many cases they may have been picked up by criminal gangs perhaps having been told that they will be sent to Rwanda if they stay

And yet there is no timeline in places for ending the practice of putting children up in hotels a temporary policy created to deal with an emergency that has become the norm

A Home Office spokesperson told us The wellbeing of children in our care is an absolute priority Robust safeguarding procedures are in place to ensure all children and minors in care are as safe and supported as possible as we seek urgent placements with a local authority

Exclusive Nick Markham a Conservative health minister who was given a peerage by Liz Truss has a substantial financial stake in a private health screening and Covid testing firm the Guardian can reveal

Markham a businessman who was appointed to the health department owns about 30 of Cignpost Investments and has done so throughout his first four months in the job raising questions about the potential for a conflict of interest

He was made a health minister in September and declared the Cignpost investment on his register of interests in the House of Lords

The Department of Health and Social Care had no comment when asked what was being done to mitigate the risks of a conflict of interest

However it is understood that Markham has told the department that he is now in the process of divesting his shareholding He resigned as a director when he became a minister in September

Shes been dubbed Toadzilla  this giant cane toad  found by rangers in Queenslands Conway national park on Thursday  is believed to be the largest of her species ever discovered tipping the scales at 27kg

A cane toad that size will eat anything it can fit into its mouth and that includes insects reptiles and small mammals says Kylee Gray the ranger who found her

The Queensland Museum is interested in taking her as she might be the largest on record  She was found at an elevation of 393 metres which isnt unusual but she has created a lot of interest among our ranger staff due to her size she added

We dubbed it Toadzilla and quickly put it into a container so we could remove it from the wild

Cane toads are one of Australias most notorious invasive species and are considered a threat to native wildlife They have colonised a wide variety of habitats across northeastern Australia after they were introduced into Queensland in 1935 to control the cane beetle

The Scottish government is just trying to make it fairer quicker and more humane for trans people to change their legal gender says Harry Nicholas who legally changed his gender in 2022 by applying for a gender recognition certificate GRC 

He decided to get one so he could marry his boyfriend as his true gender  but the reasons why trans people apply for a GRC differ from person to person

Currently to change the gender marker on their birth certificate a trans person in the UK must have a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and proof that theyve lived as their true gender for two years

The Scottish government was trying to pass a law that would simplify and speed up this process by removing the need for a diagnosis and lowering the age limit to 16 as Nicola Sturgeons government believes the current process is too difficult and invasive

But this was stopped by the UK government which has  for the first time ever  blocked a Scottish law change How

Under section 35 of the Scotland Act a UK secretary of state can stop a bill from getting royal assent if they have reasonable grounds to believe the law in question would have an adverse effect on legislation reserved to Westminster

In this case it was the Scottish secretary Alister Jack claiming the gender recognition bill would impede operation of the UK Equality Act

But Sturgeon has argued there are no grounds for the UK government to challenge the legislation as it falls within the powers of the Scottish Parliament

She has said any move to block the reforms would be using trans people as a political weapon

As the worlds elite descend on the small Swiss town of Davos this week for forums aiming to solve the biggest issues facing our world the charity Oxfam have released a report revealing the extreme gap between the worlds wealthiest and poorest people

The charity said the bestoff had pocketed 26tn 21tn in new wealth up from the start 2020 to the end of 2021 That represented 63 of the total new wealth with the rest going to the remaining 99 of people

The report calls for immediate action to tackle widening global inequality after revealing that while poverty has increased for the first time in 25 years the combined fortune of billionaires has increased by 27bn a day

The current economic reality is an affront to basic human values says Danny Sriskandarajah the chief executive of Oxfam GB

How can we accept a system where the poorest people in many countries pay much higher tax rates than the superrich Governments must introduce higher taxes on the superrich now

One of the richest men in history Elon Musk has been shown to pay a true tax rate of 32 while another of the richest billionaires Jeff Bezos pays less than 1 the report says

Oxfam said extreme concentrations of wealth led to weaker growth corrupted politics and the media corroded democracy and led to political polarisation

The superrich were key contributors to the climate crisis the charity added with a billionaire emitting a million times more carbon than the average person

Taxing the wealthiest is no longer an option  its a must said Colombias finance minister Jose Antonio Ocampo in a foreword to the report

We now have the smoking gun showing that they accurately predicted warming years before they started attacking the science said Geoffrey Supran who led the new analysis of the oil company

The oil giant Exxon privately predicted global warming correctly and skilfully only to then spend decades publicly rubbishing such science in order to protect its core business new research has found

A new study has made clear that Exxons scientists were uncannily accurate in their projections from the 1970s onwards predicting an upward curve of global temperatures and carbon dioxide emissions that is close to matching what actually occurred as the world heated up at a pace not seen in millions of years

Armed with this knowledge Exxon embarked upon a lengthy campaign to downplay or discredit what its own scientists had confirmed

What they did was essentially remain silent while doing this work and only when it became strategically necessary to manage the existential threat to their business did they stand up and speak out against the science said Supran

They could have endorsed their science rather than deny it It would have been a much harder case to deny it if the king of big oil was actually backing the science rather than attacking it he continued

A spokesperson for Exxon said This issue has come up several times in recent years and in each case our answer is the same those who talk about how Exxon Knew are wrong in their conclusions In 2019 Judge Barry Ostrager of the NY State Supreme Court listened to all the facts in a related case before him and wrote What the evidence at trial revealed is that ExxonMobil executives and employees were uniformly committed to rigorously discharging their duties in the most comprehensive and meticulous manner possible The testimony of these witnesses demonstrated that ExxonMobil has a culture of disciplined analysis planning accounting and reporting

The Guardian obtained video of both arrests through public records requests with the MiamiDade police department which assisted with executing warrants for both men

The voter fraud charges against them were separately dismissed

The videos add to mounting scrutiny over the arrests of 19 Floridians in August including Miller and Wood who were accused of voter fraud These arrests were part of the first wave brought by the office of election crimes and security a new state agency focused on investigating voter fraud Hours after the men were arrested DeSantis held a press conference saying those accused of voter fraud would pay the price

Millers attorney Robert Barrar described the video of his clients arrest as abominable

I think theyre trying to make an example of him because hes Black Its horrible he said

What we are witnessing is a terrorist attack the news anchor Erick Bang announced on the GloboNews television

Thousands of supporters of Brazils farright former president Jair Bolsonaro invaded the countrys congress presidential palace and supreme court on Sunday in a grim echo of the US Capitol invasion two years ago by backers of former president Donald Trump

Shocking video footage showed proBolsonaro militants sprinting up the ramp into the Palcio do Planalto the presidential offices roaming the buildings corridors and vandalising the nearby supreme court whose windows had been smashed

Videos posted on social media showed fires burning inside the congress building Furniture was broken and tossed around objects were reportedly stolen in the presidential palace and the supreme court and in some places sprinklers appeared to be dousing chambers

They are throwing chairs out of the windows said another bewildered GloboNews commentator Eliane Cantanhde They are destroying public buildings

Lula a veteran leftist was sworn in as Brazils new president last Sunday in celebrations attended by hundreds of thousands of Brazilians

But thousands of proBolsonaro extremists have refused to accept Lulas narrow victory in Octobers election spending recent weeks camping outside army bases across the country and calling for a military coup

Although unbelievably popular and successful while in office Lula was imprisoned on corruption charges in 2017 These charges were later annulled by the Supreme Court and he was free to run for president again in the 2022 election

These two images show Alaskas Northwestern Glacier melting over a 60 to 80 year period The Glacier retreated around six miles from when the first image was taken between the 1920s40s and 2005

This trend is only set to accelerate According to new research half the planets glaciers will have melted by 2100 even if humanity sticks to goals set out in the Paris climate agreement The scale and impacts of glacial loss are greater than previously thought and at least half of that loss will happen in the next 30 years

Researchers found 49 of glaciers would disappear under the most optimistic scenario of 15C of warming However if global heating continued under the current scenario of 27C of warming losses would be more significant with 68 of glaciers disappearing according to the paper published in Science The study looked at all glacial land ice except for Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets

This will significantly contribute to sea level rise threaten the supply of water to up to 2 billion people and increase the risk of natural hazards such as flooding

If temperature increases are limited to 15C of warming average sea levels would increase by 90mm 35in from 2015 to 2100 but with 27C of warming glacial melt would lead to around 115mm of sea level rise These scenarios are up to 23 more than previous models had estimated

Mountain glacier melt is believed to contribute to more than a third of sea level rise A lot of this loss is unavoidable but the magnitude of loss is directly related to temperature increases so acting on the climate crisis is key

The rapidly increasing glacier mass losses as global temperature increases beyond 15C stresses the urgency of establishing more ambitious climate pledges to preserve the glaciers in these mountainous regions researchers wrote

By the time you are reading this the bosses of Britains biggest companies have made more money than the average UK worker will in the entire year according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else in the country

The High Pay Centre a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers said that by 2pm on Thursday the third working day of 2023 a FTSE 100 chief executive will have been paid more on an hourly basis than the UK workers annual salary based on median average remuneration figures for both groups

According to analysis by the GMB trade union it would take a 999 ambulance call handler almost 150 years to match the pay of the average chief executive Its an utter disgrace said Gary Smith the general secretary of the GMB which represents ambulance workers set to go on strike next week NHS workers and others are being forced on to the picket lines just to make ends meet while these fat cats get the cream

FTSE 100 chief executives are paid 34m on average which works out at 103 times the 33000 average salary for fulltime UK workers according to Office for National Statistics figures

The highestpaid FTSE 100 CEO according to the research was Sbastien de Montessus of Endeavour which operates goldmines in Ivory Coast Burkina Faso and Senegal He was paid 169m including an 8m oneoff award when the firm relocated from Toronto to London

The second highestpaid boss was Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca who was paid 139m

Luke Hildyard the director of the High Pay Centre said In the worst economic circumstances that most people can remember it is difficult to believe that a handful of top earners are still raking in such extraordinary amounts of money

The UK economy really cannot afford for such a big share of the wealth that is created by all workers to be captured by such a tiny number of people at the top To address declining living standards for the majority we need measures to balance the distribution of incomes more evenly

Have you heard of Manx Gaelic

Its the rarest language in England and Wales according to the latest census  so youll be forgiven if you havent

But if you take a trip to the Isle of Man which is located in the Irish Sea between England Ireland Scotland and Wales youre far more likely to have heard it because this is where Manx Gaelic originates

For centuries Manx which is part of the Celtic language family like Irish and Scottish Gaelic was how people on the island communicated

By the 19th century however the English language took over  and by 2009 Unesco declared it extinct which was soon corrected to critically endangered after outcry from the Manx language community

Because the Isle of Man is not part of the UK  but is a selfgoverning crown dependency with its own parliament government and laws  it has its own census

And Manx is continuing to grow in popularity year on year with over 120 years of support from the community and residents on the island are using music schooling and the internet to bring back their ancestors mother tongue

We spoke to Ruth Keggin Gell from Culture Vannin She teaches Manx and is a part of the movement keeping Manx alive

Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013 has died aged 95 the Vatican has announced

A statement from Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said With sorrow I inform you that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI passed away today at 934 in the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican Further information will be provided as soon as possible

Benedict will be remembered as the first pope in 600 years to retire rather than die in office His sudden resignation in 2013 left the church reeling and began an unprecedented period in which two popes coexisted

Benedict formerly a German cardinal was a theological conservative holding uncompromising positions on homosexuality and contraception

During his tenure allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its coverup began to surface His critics said he failed to grasp the gravity of the crimes and the scale of the crisis which reached a peak several years after he was elected pope in April 2005

As well as the flood of allegations lawsuits and official reports relating to sexual abuse and the priests complicity in covering it up the Vatican was also rocked by the theft of confidential documents many of which later appeared in an expos of alleged corruption

Upon his retirement Benedict pledged to devote his life to private prayer but he remained a powerful conservative influence and a focus for opponents of successor Pope Francis and his efforts to reform the church

In April 2019 two months after Francis convened a groundbreaking Vatican conference on sexual abuse Benedict published a 6000word letter saying abuse was a product of a culture of sexual freedom dating from the 1960s

His death paves the way for Francis to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point  impossible while the outcome would have been three popes

UPDATE Romanian authorities have confirmed the pizza box featured in Andrew Tates video posted prior to his arrest did not lead police officers to his location

The controversial online influencer and selfdescribed misogynist was detained in Romania on charges of human trafficking rape and forming an organised crime group

After his arrest local media reported that prosecutors mobilised law enforcement only after seeing the Tates were together from social media

This led to online speculation and subsequent news reports that the brand of pizza featured in a video that Tate posted to his Twitter account helped police to confirm his presence in Romania

However the antiorganised crime unit representative said that it was not the case that Tates arrest had been made as a result of the pizza boxes

The former kickboxer and reality TV star was arrested alongside his brother and two other suspects

Over the past week he had been engaged in a Twitter standoff with the climate activist Greta Thunberg attempting to troll her by telling her about his large collection of emissionheavy cars Thunberg responded by implying Tate had smalldick energy

The Taliban has reportedly banned girls in Afghanistan from attending primary school in what would amount to a total ban on female education

On Tuesday the fundamentalist regime announced that women would be banned from university education indefinitely

Yesterday female students who showed up for class wept and consoled each other after they were turned away by security forces forced to reckon with the loss of their imagined futures  and the further tightening of the same extreme misogynist ideology that the Taliban once promised would not return

This news follows a series of recent edicts which suggest that the most fundamentalist voices within the Taliban are now dominant

A number of Afghan civil and womens rights activists abroad have issued a joint statement calling for the Taliban to reverse this medieval crime that will impose absolute isolation on Afghan women and girls and expose women to violence poverty and exploitation

Zahra Joya used to run Rukhshana Media a news agency she founded to report on the lives of women and girls in Afghanistan from a small office in Kabul Forced to flee after the Taliban seized power last year she relocated to London

Yesterday she wrote a piece for the Guardian speaking to women facing the abrupt end of their education  even if they were close to graduating

The quote above was written by student Sakina Sama on Facebook Joya has spoken with more women and girls about their experiences  and its a heartwrenching read

What do you think is behind this disparity

Australian women have poorer health lower incomes and less engagement in the labour force than men a new report has found

A health and wellbeing scorecard published earlier this month has found that womens economic equity and health have deteriorated in the past decade

Led by researchers at the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation the scorecard will annually document progress in health and wellbeing outcomes in Australia over time

Prof Helena Teede the MCHRIs director and a coauthor of the report said the scorecard highlighted the need for urgent structural change

Our workforce productivity is so profoundly affected by the very dramatic impact that childcare has in Australia because we have one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world she said At the moment in Australia having a family has pretty much no impact on a mans income or their career trajectory it has a very profound impact for women

The MCHRI is calling for the establishment of a national institute that focuses on womens health wellbeing and equity

A powerful congressional committee on Tuesday voted to publicly release Donald Trumps tax returns in a move that is sure to ignite a political row as well as anger among some privacy experts in America

The Democraticcontrolled House ways and means committee decided to release the documents which the former US president has long tried to shield after several hours of debate

The New York Times previously released extensive chunks of Trumps tax returns which showed how the real estate mogul and reality TV star had suffered serious losses and engaged in extensive tax avoidance

The decision by the panel comes after a long battle that ultimately resulted in the supreme court clearing the way last month for the treasury department to send the returns to Congress The committee received six years of tax returns for Trump and some of his businesses

Alwadaei confronted the Conservative MP outside a reception hosted by the Bahraini embassy on Wednesday about trips he had taken that were paid for by the Bahraini government ahead of its elections

Breaking The January 6 committee has referred Donald Trump to the justice department for criminal charges accusing the former president of fomenting an insurrection and conspiring against the government over his attempt to subvert the outcome of the 2020 election and the bloody attack on the US Capitol

The committee believes that more than sufficient evidence exists for a criminal referral of former President Trump for assisting or aiding and comforting those at the Capitol who engaged in a violent attack on the United States congressman Jamie Raskin said as the committee held its final public meeting

The committees referrals approved by its members Monday are the first time in American history that Congress has recommended charges against a former president It comes after more than a year of investigation by the bipartisan House of Representatives panel tasked with understanding Trumps plot to stop Joe Biden from taking office

The referrals are largely a recommendation but will arrive at a justice department already busy investigating the former president for crimes he may have committed during and after his time in office

The panel is expected to release a lengthy report into the attack that left five people dead and spawned nearly 1000 criminal cases

As a relatively wealthy country the UK should not have residents facing a choice of whether to feed their families or heat their homes

This is what one Guardian reader told us about why theyre donating to our annual charity appeal

We are raising money for grassroots charities providing muchneeded support services to people struggling at the frontline of the cost of living crisis via our two charity partners Citizens Advice UK and Locality

An incredible 500000 has been donated already to our appeal by generous Guardian and Observer readers with many people telling us that to them donating has been an expression of anger and frustration with the government for not enough being done to support families on low incomes

For some this is also about simple human compassion Times are hard and a little kindness is needed added one of our readers

Donations will go to local voluntary organisations working in some of the UKs most deprived areas which are providing crisis support ranging from food banks and warm rooms to debt and housing advice and mental health help

Eleven days after her father died crossing the Channel sevenyearold Clara Hussain Hasib learned of his passing

Hussein Haseeb Ahmeds wife Afan Talib was told about her husbands death when she received a phone call from the Iraqi consulate in London while they were in their home in Chamchamal in northern Iraq

Ahmed 31 died on 19 November a week after arriving in the UK following a long journey from Kurdistan and being taken to Manston a Home Office site where initial checks are carried out on small boat arrivals

People are only supposed to be held there for 24 hours but Ahmed was there for seven days and is believed to have been held there unlawfully He is confirmed to have had a diphtheria infection but it is not yet known if that was the cause of his death

Talib and Clara told the Guardian they could not believe their beloved husband and father was gone and were hoping against hope there had been a mixup and the man who died was not Ahmed

The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed there have been at least 50 diphtheria cases this year 49 of them relating to asylum seekers in Manston in October and November

Ahmed made the difficult decision to travel to the UK using smugglers because he wanted to go to the best country in the world for human rights something he said was lacking in Kurdistan

The family were not well off They rented their home and Ahmed worked at different jobs including as a hospital cleaner and on a market stall They sold everything to pay the smugglers for Ahmeds journey  even their mattress duvet and pillows Now Afan and Clara are moving between the homes of Afans and Ahmeds parents

For the past 12 weeks revolutionary sentiment has been coursing through the cities and towns of the Persian plateau

The agitation was triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini a young Kurdish woman on 16 September after she was arrested by the morality police in Tehran

From the outset the movement had a feminist character but it has also united citizens of different classes and ethnicities around a shared desire to see the back of the Islamic Republic 

This movement without a name without a leader is diverse and adaptable

It has harnessed a vast and hitherto underexploited resource  the latent dissatisfaction of women at their secondclass status  and turned it into a mighty asset

Will this generation succeed where previous attempts to unseat the Islamic hardliners have been crushed

How would you feel if you were suddenly a year younger

South Korea has passed laws to scrap its traditional method of counting ages  a shift that will make its citizens either one or two years younger on official documents

South Koreans are deemed to be a year old when they are born and a year is added every 1 January The unusual  and increasingly unpopular  custom means a baby born on New Years Eve becomes two years old as soon as the clock strikes midnight

However a separate system also exists for conscription purposes or calculating the legal age to drink alcohol and smoke in which a persons age is calculated from zero at birth and a year is added on 1 January

On top of this for medical and legal documents South Korea uses the international standard of measuring age where someone is zero at their birth and turns a year older on their birthday

The confusing array of systems will disappear from June 2023  at least on official documents

The revision is aimed at reducing unnecessary socioeconomic costs because legal and social disputes as well as confusion persist due to the different ways of calculating age Yoo Sangbum of the ruling People Power party told parliament

Jeong Daeun a 29yearold office worker is happy about the change and says she has always had to think twice when asked overseas about her age

Who wouldnt welcome getting a year or two younger she added

Theyre just twofaced Im just tired of them standing there and saying how wonderful the Capitol police is and they turn around and  go down to MaraLago and kiss Trumps ring

This is how the mother of Brian Sicknick who died after a mob of Donald Trump supporters ransacked the US Capitol building denounced Senior Republicans Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy at an event for the police who defended against the 6 January insurrection  according to a tweet by CNN congressional reporter Daniella Diaz

During the Congressional Gold Medal award ceremony earlier this week the January 6 officers and relatives walked straight past the Republican duo barely looking at them

McConnell the Senate minority leader was caught on video with his hand outstretched waiting in line for handshakes that never came as senior officers and Sicknicks parents warmly greeted the Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer

McCarthy who hopes to become Speaker when Republicans take over the House majority next month was widely condemned for what analysts said was a pilgrimage to Donald Trumps Florida resort in the days after the insurrection

Both McConnell and McCarthy have been criticised for not standing up to Trump

Russia freed the WNBA star Brittney Griner in a dramatic highlevel prisoner exchange with the US releasing the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout American officials said

The swap at a time of heightened tensions over Ukraine achieved a top goal for Joe Biden but carried a heavy price and left behind an American jailed for nearly four years in Russia 

Paul Whelan a Michigan corporate security executive has been jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges his family and the US government say are baseless

The deal the second such exchange in eight months with Russia procured the release of the most prominent American detained abroad Griner is a twotime Olympic gold medalist whose monthslong imprisonment on drug charges brought unprecedented attention to the population of wrongful detainees

Bidens authorization to release a Russian felon once nicknamed the Merchant of Death underscored the escalating pressure that his administration faced to get Griner home particularly after the recent resolution of her criminal case and her subsequent transfer to a penal colony

The swap was confirmed by US officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations who were not authorized to publicly discuss the deal before a White House announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity

The Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock has won the Georgia Senate runoff securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his partys majority in the chamber

The Associated Press called the race about three and a half hours after polls closed in Georgia

The news came a month after the national midterm elections when neither Walker or Warnock secured enough support to win outright thus requiring the runoff race

The result of the runoff did not determine control of the Senate as Democrats have already won enough seats to maintain their hold for the next two years

But Warnocks victory gives Democrats a crucial 51st seat allowing them to abandon their current powersharing agreement with Republicans in the evenly divided chamber A 51seat majority will also provide Democrats with some wriggle room when it comes to close committee votes and nomination fights

Nearly 2 million Georgians cast ballots in the runoff before election day and those early voters appeared to significantly favor Warnock Republicans were counting on a strong election day turnout but Walkers support on Tuesday was not enough to get him across the line
Indonesian democracy is dead

These were the words of lawyer Citra Referandum as she joined a small protest outside the parliament building in Jakarta after Indonesias parliament passed new legislation to overhaul the countrys criminal code to outlaw sex outside marriage and curtail free speech

Newspapers in Australia have labelled the legislation the Bali bonk ban as the law will apply to Indonesians and visiting foreigners

These are six of the most significant parts of the code

 Sex outside marriage will be punishable by up to a year in jail
 Unmarried couples living together could face six months in prison
 In both cases charges can be based only on police reports lodged by a spouse parents or children
 There will also be punishments for insulting the president
 Under the code women can be punished for their dress
 And the promotion of contraception and religious blasphemy will be illegal

There are fears the rules could have a severe impact on LGBTQ communities in Indonesia where gay marriage is not acknowledged

Amidst muted protests this morning Referandum the director of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute said she expected peoples anger will mount over what is seen as a dramatic setback to freedoms in the worlds thirdlargest democracy

Does this term resonate with you

For the first time ever the 2022 Oxford word of the year has been decided by a public vote and the winner is goblin mode

More than 340000 English speakers decided between a choice of three words or phraseshashtags given that word is defined fairly loosely narrowed down by lexicographers from Oxford University Press

Metaverse was the second choice followed by IStandWith Goblin mode was a landslide victory it was selected by 318956 people making up 93 of the overall vote

Given the year weve just experienced goblin mode resonates with all of us who are feeling a little overwhelmed at this point the president of Oxford Languages Casper Grathwohl said Its a relief to acknowledge that were not always the idealised curated selves that were encouraged to present on our Instagram and TikTok feeds

The hashtag goblinmode on TikTok is often used as a rebuff of the that girl trend which is all about being the best version of yourself ie getting up early to exercise performing elaborate skincare routines and drinking organic smoothies  and of course posting about all of this on social media

The winning term was first seen on Twitter in 2009 but went viral in February 2022 after being tweeted in a mockedup headline

Goblin mode embraces the comforts of depravity wrote our technology reporter karipaul in March who attributed the rise in the phrases usage to the pandemics third year and the feared launch of World War Three

What we have here is just a crazy system 

England is one of the few countries in the world where water is fully owned by private companies These companies answer to investors based thousands of miles away from their customers

We are managing our water in the interests of offshore investors said Kate Bayliss from the department of economics at SOAS University of London and author of several papers on Englands privatised water

These offshore investors include private and stateowned international funds banks multinationals and billionaires headquartered outside the UK and they control at least 72 of English water new Guardian research has found

They do not want us to call it protests anymore They tell me this is the Iranian revolution

People across Iran have been protesting for nearly three months defying a deadly crackdown by regime forces The demonstrations are seen as a fierce challenge to four decades of hardline clerical rule 

The protesters cry of Woman Life Freedom has galvanised the movement which has travelled across the world but within Iran there have been more than 18000 arrests violence and a rising death toll 

According to human rights activists Irans security forces have killed at least 448 people in the last 11 weeks including 60 children under the age of 18 and 29 women

This blank piece of paper represents all of their complaints everything thats in their hearts and in their minds

The largest protests in a generation erupted in cities across China over the weekend against the governments zeroCovid policy 

The most widely used symbol in the demonstrations has been a blank sheet of paper It symbolises censorship and may also some Twitter users pointed out be read as a reference to the deaths last week of 10 people in a building fire in Urumqi Xinjiang which was blamed on lockdown restrictions that protesters believe prevented the residents from escaping in time In China white is a colour used at funerals But protesters have found other creative ways to express their anger as Helen Davidson explains

The prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand have taken a swipe at suggestions their first facetoface meeting in New Zealand happened because they are both young female leaders

A journalist has asked Jacinda Ardern if she only met with Finnish leader Sanna Marin due to their similar age and other common stuff

Ardern hit back saying I wonder whether or not anyone ever asked Barack Obama and John Key if they met because they were of similar age Marin said We are meeting because we are prime ministers

Marin is in New Zealand for her first official tour marking the first visit to the country by a Finnish prime minister After a bilateral meeting on Wednesday morning the two leaders affirmed the warm relationship between New Zealand and Finland and their commitment to boosting trade opportunities tackling climate change and deepening ties

For nearly 1300 years no one knew it was there 

The name of a highly educated English woman secretly scratched on to the pages of a rare medieval manuscript in the eighth century but impossible to read  until now

Academics have discovered the Old English female name Eadburg was repeatedly scored into the surface of the religious text using a method that kept it hidden from the naked eye for more than 12 centuries

The covert writing of the womans name was finally revealed when researchers at the Bodleian Library in Oxford used cuttingedge technology to capture the 3D surface of the ancient manuscript a Latin copy of the Acts of the Apostles that was made in England between AD700 and AD750

It is the first time this technology capable of revealing almost invisible markings so shallow they measure about a fifth of the width of a human hair has been used to record annotations on the surface of a manuscript

There are only a limited number of surviving early medieval manuscripts which contain clear internal evidence of a woman having created owned or used them said Jessica Hodgkinson a PhD student at the University of Leicester who made the discovery while researching her thesis on women and early medieval manuscripts

Writing Eadburgs name on the book quietly asserted her power and high status at a time when only a few elite highly educated women were able to write and read both Old English and Latin Its a hugely significant and very powerful text  the word of God conveyed through the apostles And I think that might be at least part of the reason why somebody chose to write Eadburgs name into it so that she was close to that

Still to this day theres this human urge to leave a mark of your presence on something that is meaningful to you or is a record of where youve been said Hodgkinson

We dont know all that much about Eadburg but now because of this amazing technology weve seen her name we know she was there Shes here in this book  and it speaks across the centuries

Growing frustration with Beijings strict zeroCovid policy has sparked a wave of unprecedented protests across China

Groups of people numbering from single digits to about 1000 have gathered for candlelit vigils and peaceful street protests In some places like Wuhan they have pushed over pandemic barriers and in Shanghai clashed with police

Holding candles phone lights and blank pieces of paper demonstrators have called for the end of lockdowns and frequent mass testing

Other protests have heard demands for democracy and press freedom and an end to online censorship

For groups of protesters apparently without central coordination to take to the streets across China and to social media and for some then explicitly to call for Xi and the Communist party to stand aside is a seismic shock writes our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour adding that Xi is unlikely to tolerate dissent for long

Have you heard of neza bazi aka tent pegging

Its an ancient cavalry sport that originated in south Asia centuries ago and its rising in popularity in the UK

Some claim neza bazis origins date back to the time of Alexander the Great or the Persian empire But historical records pinpoint its practice to Indian cavalry during the British Raj when it was used as a military tactic to attack tents

They would send their crack team of tent pegging cavalry in to whip the pegs out collapse the tents create confusion because theyd all be asleep and stuck inside the tents Then the infantry would finish them off and they wouldnt know what hit them said Jem Pearce 44 a spokeswoman for the British Tent Pegging Association

The growing controversy over a PPE company linked to the Tory peer Michelle Mone has sparked an angry reaction in parliament as MPs demanded an investigation into wider concerns over what one called absolutely sickening shameful and unforgivable instances of politically connected firms profiteering from unusable PPE during the pandemic

Parliamentarians on Thursday asked ministers for more information about how PPE Medpro was awarded more than 200m in government contracts after it was referred to ministers by Lady Mone

Millions of pounds of PPE Medpros profits were later transferred to a secret offshore trust fund of which Mone and her family members were beneficiaries The gowns provided by this company were rejected after inspection and never used in the NHS PPE Medpro insists the gowns passed inspection and that the company is entitled to keep the money

Neil OBrien a junior health minister defended the governments actions denying that political connections played a role in the distribution of contracts adding that the referral system connected ministers with members of the public who wanted to help plug shortages

Mones lawyer last year said she did not benefit financially and was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity On Thursday Mone broke a 10month silence on Twitter by sharing an image that said Dont believe everything you read or everything you think

During an urgent question tabled by the deputy leader of the opposition Angela Rayner the Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi said it was absolutely sickening shameful and unforgivable that chums of the Conservative party were profiteering as the country struggled with Covid

The Commons Speaker reminded members that parliamentary procedure meant MPs were not allowed to specifically criticise the conduct of Mone a sitting member of the House of Lords

This getrichquick scheme to fasttrack cronies politically connected pals and colleagues was never going to end well I suspect that todays revelations however shocking are simply the tip of a very large iceberg  an iceberg that could yet sink this ship of fools

This is how the Scottish National Partys Brendan OHara referred to the Guardians recent revelations that Tory peer Michelle Mone secretly received 29m from a VIP lane PPE firm

Lady Mones support helped newly formed company PPE Medpro secure a place in a VIP lane the government used during the coronavirus pandemic to prioritise companies that had political connections The company went on to win two multimillion pound contracts supplying PPE to the NHS during Covids first deadly wave

Now documents seen by the Guardian indicate that Mone and her children secretly received 29m of PPE Medpros profits which were passed on from her husband through a series of offshore accounts trusts and companies

Contacted about the new disclosures a lawyer for Mone said There are a number of reasons why our client cannot comment on these issues and she is under no duty to do so A lawyer who represents both her husband Douglas Barrowman and PPE Medpro said that an ongoing investigation limited what they were able to say on these matters He added For the time being we are also instructed to say that there is much inaccuracy in the portrayal of the alleged facts and a number of them are completely wrong

Human rights are nonnegotiable

Germanys players placed hands over their mouths and wore rainbow stripes on their warmup tops and boots in a show of defiance against Fifa before their World Cup match against Japan

In a powerful statement published shortly after the game started the German Football Association warned footballs governing body Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice We stand by our position 
It wasnt about making a political statement  human rights are nonnegotiable That should be taken for granted but it still isnt the case Thats why this message is so important to us

Their message was reinforced by the German interior minister Nancy Faeser who also wore a OneLove armband which promotes tolerance diversity and LGBTQ rights as she sat next to Fifas president Gianni Infantino at the Khalifa International Stadium in Qatar

Germany are one of seven nations including England and Wales who were banned by Fifa from wearing the armband on Sunday The fear of sporting sanctions  including captains receiving a yellow card at kickoff  had led the teams to backtrack from their promise to wear the OneLove in their World Cup matches

However Danish football federation chief executive Jakob Jensen has confirmed that those nations were now exploring legal options to overturn Fifas decision

Has The Simpsons predicted the future again 

In what looks like it could only have come from the nuclear lake in The Simpsons an angler has caught the worlds largest goldfish

Andy Hackett caught the 30kg leather carpkoi hybrid aptly named the Carrot in Bluewater Lakes in Champagne France

Thats nearly as heavy as five bowling balls

It was put into the lake 20 years ago and has proved to be a slippery customer ever since

Hackett from Kidderminster in Worcestershire reportedly spent 25 minutes bringing the fish in

It is a hybrid species of a leather carp and koi and is thought to be the second largest of its type ever caught

42yearold Hackett said I always knew the Carrot was in there but never thought I would catch it

I knew it was a big fish when it took my bait and went off side to side and up and down with it Then it came to the surface 30 or 40 yards out and I saw that it was orange

It was brilliant to catch it but it was also sheer luck

He posed for a photos afterwards before releasing it back into the water

There are residents trapped said Ridwan Kamil the governor of West Java province after a fatal quake which was centred in the Cianjur region at a depth of 62 miles 10km

Kamil told reporters that he believed the death toll was expected to rise based on the damage he has already seen So many buildings crumbled and shattered he said

Footage from Cianjur showed a school building with a collapsed roof as well as badly damaged homes where brick walls had been torn down At a local hospital overwhelmed by the number of victims the injured were treated outside some lying on mattresses or blankets on the ground as they were given oxygen masks and IV drips

Indonesia is especially vulnerable to earthquakes because of its position on the socalled Pacific Ring of Fire the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world

Joshua Thurman has spoken about the moment he heard gunfire and saw a flash from the muzzle of the gun used in a mass shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs

At least five people were killed and another 25 were injured in a shooting late Saturday officials first said at least 18 people were wounded though that number was increased after an update later in the day

Thurman says the shooting has shattered the local LGBTQ community saying This is the only LGBTQIA space we have in the city of Colorado Springs Where are we going to go We can rebuild we can do things but its not going to bring back the five people that died

There is a history of attacks at LGBTQ venues in the US In 2016 a gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 a gay nightclub in Orlando in one of the deadliest attacks in US history

The attack took place at Club Q a club that had a weekly drag show scheduled on Saturday evenings according to an archived version of its website

The shooting happened amid growing fears of violence and intimidation toward drag queens Those fears were sparked by Republicans who have targeted drag queens with legislation that would ban drag shows entirely prohibit drag story hours at libraries that are meant to familiarise children with them and bar minors from attending drag shows

Did you know that coral is an animal

Each structure that we know of as coral is made up of thousands of tiny creatures which rely on algae for energy

But this makes them incredibly temperature sensitive and the heating of our seas and oceans is causing them to expel their algae leaving behind the white skeletons seen in bleaching events

Many of the worlds reefs now face an existential crisis with 14 lost between 2009 and 2018  and even if the 15C limit on global heating is kept more than 90 will be destroyed by severe aquatic heatwaves

We spoke to Simon Donner simondonner a climate scientist who took a break from the Cop27 talks in Egypt to go snorkeling with us to examine their current state  and explain why coral reefs are so important

Republicans have won back control of the House of Representatives scraping a victory from a midterms election that many had expected to be a red wave of wins but which instead turned into more of a trickle

Nevertheless the party finally won its crucial 218th seat in the lower chamber of Congress wresting away control from the Democrats and setting the stage for a showdown with Joe Biden in the next two years of his presidency

The result means the end of Democrat Nancy Pelosis time as House speaker and is likely to pass the speakers gavel to Republican leader Kevin McCarthy who has announced his intention to take up the post

Control of the House is crucial as it will allow the Republicans to launch an array of congressional investigations ranging from Bidens botched withdrawal from Afghanistan to more obviously politicized probes of government actions during the coronavirus pandemic and Bidens son Hunters business activities

Donald Trump has announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 likely sparking another period of tumult in US politics and especially his own political party

In order to make America great and glorious again I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States Trump said from ballroom of his private MaraLago Club in Palm Beach on Tuesday night

The longexpected announcement by a twiceimpeached president who incited a deadly attack on Congress seems guaranteed to deepen a stark partisan divide that has fueled fears of increased political violence

But it also comes as Trumps standing in the Republican party has suddenly been put into question Trump spoke at MaraLago a week after midterm elections in which his Republican party did not make expected gains losing the Senate and seeming on course for only a narrow majority in the US House

We were lied to

In the leadup to the 2022 midterm elections the punditocracy of commentators pollsters and politicaltypes united behind the threat of a looming red wave of Republican gains

But one dissenting voice stood out that of leftist filmmaker Michael Moore Against all the commonplace predictions he had forecast Democrats would do well He called it a blue tsunami

That proved to be true in his home state of Michigan where Democrats won governor house and senate for the first time in 40 years often by large margins Its been more of a blue wall across the rest of the country where Republican gains mostly failed to materialize with the exception of Florida 

But even so the strong performance by Democrats has stunned people on both sides of the US political divide delighting the left and sparking handwringing on the right

With the Democrats retaining power in the Senate and Republicans poised to take the House by only a handful of seats vastly falling below expectations suddenly Moore is looking like a prognosticator par excellence

Were halfway through Cop27 but will it achieve progress on these three pressing climate issues

 Limit global heating to 15C
At Cop26 countries agreed that this target would help avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis  now they need to meet it

 Climate finance
Wealthier countries have been promising to give more money to poorer countries to help adapt their homes to the extreme weather

 Loss and damage
Activists have called for funding to help with the destruction the climate breakdown has already caused to vulnerable and poor countries These are also the people who have done little to cause the climate crisis

Awardwinning Guardian environment editor Fiona Harvey shares whether the pledges and plans made so far by world leaders at the climate summit in Egypt have been enough

Democrats have kept control of the Senate after the crucial race in Nevada was announced in their favor cementing a midterms election performance for the party that widely beat expectations

Democratic US senator Catherine Cortez Masto has now beaten Republican challenger Adam Laxalt a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former president Donald Trump the Associated Press said

With Mastos victory coming on the heels of Democratic senator Mark Kelly winning reelection in Arizona late on Friday the win takes the Democrats to the crucial number of 50 seats in the Senate with the Republicans at 49 

The race in Georgia is set to go to a runoff in December but even if Republicans win there a 5050 split means the Senate would effectively be controlled by the Democrats because the tying vote falls to the vicepresident Kamala Harris

For the Republicans it was another blow after they steeply underperformed in many races The party had touted hopes of a red wave that could sweep across the US and deliver the upper chamber of Congress into their hands Instead  with a few exceptions such as Florida  the wave was more of a trickle

The Democrat win in the Senate is likely to prompt further recrimination in Republican circles over who is to blame for the poor showing 

Much attention has so far focused on Trump after he backed rightwing or celebrity candidates in several key races who lost such as Dr Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania

The victory is also another boost for president Joe Biden after his party defied immediate fears that his low popularity ratings and an electorate battered by high inflation would translate to punishment at the polls 

The Democrats also defied historical precedent as the party holding the White House often loses heavily in midterm elections

People have described Cop27 as the African Cop  writes Ugandan climate activist vanessanakate1 who has today been protesting for climate justice at the conference in Egypt

But she says the summit can only live up to that name if world leaders are prepared to actually deal with the needs of people suffering from a crisis they have played little role in creating

As 37 million people are facing starvation in the Horn of Africa and while negotiators in Sharm elSheikh hash out plans for how to help those most vulnerable to climate breakdown Nakate explains why she thinks its time for wealthier countries to adopt loss and damage finance  and what exactly that means

Its humiliating

A Kulkalgal activist from the Torres Strait Islands has said the way the world often treats Indigenous people is an insult and that he is here at the Cop27 conference in Egypt fighting for our home

Yessie Mosby who in September was part of a group of claimants who made history during a landmark legal case that found the Australian government should compensate Torres Strait Islanders for their climate crisis failures told the Guardian that we were a race of people that we have hold on to a lot of ancient knowledge which is being neglected and pushed aside

Whether its us in the saltwater people of the Pacific Islands or the people of the plains and the mountains the swamps who are facing climate change and really want our voices to be heard And we really need action

We the Torres Strait saltwater people we are so in tune with nature We are a race that will see birds and they will tell us what the weather is going to be like tomorrow we look at plants which tells us which particular fish are to be eaten or not to be eaten we see plants which tells us that this particular fish in the water is poisonous

The world definitely will have a lot to learn from us

The Guardians Patrick Greenfield asked the World Bank president David Malpass if he was a climate denier at Cop27 This is what he said 

You know that Im not a climate denier So dont misreport it he said when asked following an event 

Malpass a Donald Trump appointee has previously said he did not even know if he accepted climate science Joe Bidens White House condemned his comments Malpass later apologised 

The World Bank has repeatedly failed to adopt a strong action plan on the climate crisis and is under growing pressure to reform to help finance the climate transition in developing countries

The banks president had rejected requests for interviews at Cop27 after he was delayed in South Africa before the climate summit when his plane got caught in lightning

When approached on Wednesday Malpass refused to answer questions about the need for World Bank reform before walking backstage

There were fraught scenes at the Cop 27 climate conference today as the sister of the jailed BritishEgyptian activist Alaa Abd elFattah was harassed by a proregime lawmaker as she spoke at a press conference on the fears she has for her brothers life

Writer Abd elFattah has been on hunger strike for nearly seven months and told his family shortly before the beginning of the UN climate conference in Sharm elSheik that he would begin a water strike

His family are demanding proof of life from the desert prison where he is currently held after failing to receive a letter that would provide information about his condition

Speaking to the Guardian today Seif added that she fears the Egyptian authorities will begin force feeding her brother in order to guarantee nothing happens while the world is watching which would be a form of torture but added that she had no received any updates despite her mother waiting outside the prison for hours and attempts to push the UK government and Rishi Sunak to do more

The midterm elections are here 

As US voters go to the polls today they are voting in what Joe Biden has framed as a vital test for American democracy in the face of a Republican party fielding candidates who buy into the big lie of a stolen 2020 election

Republicans meanwhile have tried to capitalize on widespread economic anxiety in the face of rising inflation as well as stoking culture war themes and fears over crime often spilling over into racism and intolerance

Millions of voters are casting their ballot as both parties fight for control of Congress numerous state governorships as well as many local offices and ballot initiatives on issues like abortion

A handful of general scenarios could play out each having momentous significance for the Biden presidency and the tactics of a resurgent Republican party and its de facto leader Donald Trump

Weve been excluded

When 24yearold Ugandan activist mnyomb1 arrived in Egypt for the Cop27 climate summit today he was turned away from the high level talks because he did not have the right accreditation

Only country delegates and some members of the press were allowed in the event for heads of states and government officials

Why are we here asks Nyombi  adding that the world leaders and negotiators who are currently deciding how far to push climate action need to quickly change the way they work and who they listen to saying right now he doesnt think it is right to truly call this an African Cop

You have to frontline the voices of African youth activists because these are the innovators These are the ones implementing actions not our leaders our leaders are just always in the office but you are excluding us So it is time to understand that this event is in Africa We need to give African voices a chance  We cannot lead without knowledge

Some asylum seekers described the conditions at the airfield which provides tented accommodation as being like a prison with reports of an outbreak of diphtheria

This week began with an astonishing political comeback in Brazil

Brazils leftist former president Luiz Incio Lula da Silva  known as Lula  narrowly defeated far right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro by two percentage points

By choosing Lula Brazil is abandoning Bolsonaros farright vision for the country which has been characterised over the past three years by attacks on democratic institutions the media the left and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest Instead the Brazilian electorate chose Lula and a platform that centred around social justice environmental protection defending democracy and reunifying the country

Four more years of Bolsonaro would have had devastating environmental consequences not just for Brazil but for the whole world Two billion trees have been burned or cut down during his presidency  an area the size of greater London was lost in the first six months of 2022 alone

So is there reason to be hopeful now

Our Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips thinks there definitely is And analysis conducted for Carbon Brief indicates that Lulas victory could cut Amazon deforestation by 89 over the next decade

In the leadup to the Cop27 climate summit many activists have accused the organisers of greenwashing

This is not the first time that the UNs conference of the parties Cop has been accused of this but the event this year has received extra criticism because its taking place in Egypt  a country with a poor human rights record and imprisoning activists

At this very moment Alaa Abd ElFattah one of Egypts most highprofile political prisoners is still behind bars after being imprisoned by the countrys authorities nine years ago Hes currently on hunger strike and will refuse water from 6 November the first day of the climate summit

Many people dont think that climate justice can be debated at Cop27 when its taking place in a country that imprisons activists and bans certain research Unless political freedoms are defended there will be no meaningful climate action says author Naomi Klein

Meanwhile activists have also been making demands from the organisers to try and see Cop27 deliver greater climate action and change to the summit

Whether its throwing soup on Van Goghs Sunflowers or scaling bridges climate activist group Just Stop Oil have made more than a few waves during a month of protests throughout October

Many say these striking protests are even more remarkable in that they have been funded in part by an oil heiress Aileen Getty a philanthropist whose grandfather was the tycoon J Paul Getty cofounded the Climate Emergency Fund and has gifted it 1m to be used by activists

Among thousands of other smaller donors to the fund several other prominent figures have made major contributions  Abigail Disney scion of the Disney family has given 200000 and Adam McKay director of the darkly satirical climate film Dont Look Up has pledged 4m

Theories have even been spread on social media that the stunt was aimed at discrediting climate activists as part of an elaborate ruse concocted by Getty

In an opinion piece from The Guardian last month Aileen Getty wrote
I am the daughter of a famous family who built their fortune on fossil fuels Our family sold that company four decades ago and I instead vowed to use my resources to take every means to protect life on Earth

In what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history thousands of patients were infected with HIV and hepatitis in the 1970s and 80s through contaminated blood products imported from the US

It is thought that to date about 2400 people have died as a result and infected people are dying at a rate of one every four days according to the Terrence Higgins Trust

Campaigners have been fighting for this compensation for around three decades and welcome the payout But they say the fight for justice continues as only those directly infected or their partners are eligible

This means thousands of bereaved parents who lost their children and children who lost their parents to the scandal have not received any compensation

Richard Angell a campaigns director at thtorguk said The government deserves huge plaudits for making this vital first step but momentum cannot be lost and a full compensation scheme for the whole community  parents carers and children included  must be expedited

In 13 US states abortion is banned in the earliest stages of pregnancy But we rarely see what such tissue looks like 

In the earlier stages of the pandemic when some states tried to deem abortion as nonessential medical care the MYA Network a network of clinicians and activists came together to show us what tissue in the first nine weeks of pregnancy actually looks like 

The photos show the early pregnancy tissue removed at four weeks through to whats removed at nine weeks

At four weeks Dr Joan Fleischman part of the MYA Network uses a gentle handheld device that removes the tissue This more delicate type of extraction keeps it intact

The final slide shows the gestational sac of the pregnancy at nine weeks This is everything that would be removed during an abortion and includes the nascent embryo which is not easily discernible to the naked eye

Sometimes patients want to see the tissue after an abortion They are stunned by what it actually looks like says Dr Fleischman Thats when I realized how much the imagery on the internet and on placards  showing humanlike qualities at this early stage of development  has really permeated the culture People almost dont believe this is what comes out

Breaking Rishi Sunak has won the Conservative leadership contest and will become the UKs third prime minister in the space of seven weeks taking over from Liz Truss

The former chancellor who has been an MP for seven years and was in the cabinet for just over two years was confirmed as the winner on Monday after the only other remaining candidate Penny Mordaunt failed to reach the threshold of 100 nominations from her fellow MPs Former prime minister Boris Johnson pulled out of the accelerated leadership contest last night

Sunak whose parents are of Punjabi Indian heritage will be the first person of colour to become UK prime minister as well as the first practising Hindu selected for the job He is not the first minority ethnic PM  Benjamin Disraeli who held the office twice between 1868 and 1880 was of Jewish heritage

Sunak is likely to formally take over as prime minister from Truss in the next day or so If he takes over tomorrow Truss will have served as prime minister for just 50 days the shortest tenure in history She agreed to step down last Thursday after chaos within her cabinet and amid a turbulent reaction to her minibudget in September

In a town in northern Philippines where floods have become a perennial problem motorcycle taxi drivers have modified their vehicles to keep passengers dry and high above the knee to waistdeep floodwaters

Motorcycle taxis a popular form of transport in rural Philippines have had steel tubes added to the forks of the vehicles boosting them by a few extra feet to allow them to operate in the worst kinds of floods

Some streets in Hagonoy just outside the capital Manila have been impassable in recent years with rain levels reaching as high as two metres 65 feet in monsoon season when residents either wade through thighdeep water or travel in small boats

One of the towns problems according to officials is the rapid rise in informal dwellings along a nearby river and lack of adequate waste management solutions

Until things change many of those living in Hagonoy say the modified motorbikes have become a godsend for them to go about their daily lives

Ukraine is using sandbags to try to protect its cultural monuments from Russian bombs

Boxed up muffled veiled and hidden they give Kyiv a strange new look  as if the sculptures have been replaced by contemporary artworks the Guardians Charlotte Higgins writes

For two Mondays in a row Russia has launched missiles at Kyivs city centre in the most intense strikes on the capital since Moscow launched its fullscale invasion of Ukraine

The targets of these missiles are unclear  if they were meant to strike crucial infrastructure the only real clarity is that they have exploded in central residential districts falling close to parks offices and cultural buildings

Two of last weeks explosions were so close to significant national monuments that some speculated that the statues themselves might have been the targets

Russia launched a wave of 28 drones against Ukraines capital this morning killing at least three people

Photos showed the drones swooping low across the skies of Kyiv as police officers fired at them from the ground and residents scurried to shelters Other images showed smoke rising from explosions across the city

Kyivs mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said a woman died from one of the blasts in the citys central Shevchenkiv district and another person was trapped under the rubble of a house

According to Ukrainian military officials kamikaze drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but have proved effective at causing damage to targets on the ground The Shahed136 drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets before being flown into enemy troops armour or buildings and explode on impact

It comes just days after Russias president Vladimir Putin promised there would be no need for more massive strikes on Ukraine

Ten years ago this week Julia Gillard gave her famous speech against misogyny in the workplace as Australias first female prime minister

Gillard stood up in parliament called out the thenopposition leader and demanded a higher standard in her workplace

That was a decade ago but what about sexism in the workplace today

Just this week a damning report leaked to the Guardian revealed that the Royal College of Nursing in the UK the worlds biggest nurses union has exposed bullying misogyny and a sexual culture where women are at risk of alcohol and powerrelated exploitation

Last month on International Equal Pay Day the International Labour ILO Organization revealed that on average women globally are paid about 20 per cent less than men

This pay gap is even bigger for Black and Hispanic women and a study in the US found that last year Black women averagely earnt 639 less than white men and Hispanic or Latina women earn 573 less
A decade later and workplaces continue to prejudice against women workers

Robbie Coltrane whose acting career spanned everything from Bond films to Cracker to Harry Potter has died aged 72

Born Anthony Robert McMillan in the prosperous Glaswegian suburb of Rutherglen Coltrane was educated at Glenalmond College an independent boarding school whose corporal punishment he described as legalised violence before going to the Glasgow School of Art

He had second thoughts about his ability as a painter and switched to live performance acting in radical theatre companies including a troupe from San Quentin State prison and doing standup taking the pseudonym Coltrane as homage to celebrated jazz musician John Coltrane

His first screen credit was Waterloo Sunset the Richard Eyredirected Play for Today in 1979 in which he played opposite Queenie Wattss carehome escapee

Coltranes raised status was confirmed by his casting as the criminal psychologist Fitz Fitzgerald in Jimmy McGoverns TV series Cracker which first aired in 1993 A defiantly noncomic role Fitzgerald was a groundbreaking creation brilliant at his job but a mess in his personal life Coltrane won the best TV actor Bafta in 1994 1995 and 1996 for the role

He found himself at the top of the list for the casting of Hogwarts school groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid in the film adaptation of JK Rowlings Harry Potter series The first in the series Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone was released in 2001 and gained Coltrane a new audience of younger fans

The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay 965m to people who suffered from his false claim that the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax a jury in Connecticut decided

The verdict is the second major judgment against the Infowars host over his relentless promotion of the lie that the 2012 massacre never happened and that the grieving families seen in news coverage were actors hired as part of a plot to take away peoples guns

It came in a lawsuit filed by the relatives of five children and three educators killed in the mass shooting plus an FBI agent who was among the first responders to the scene A Texas jury in August awarded nearly 50m to the parents of another slain child

The Connecticut trial featured tearful testimony from parents and siblings of the victims who told about how they were threatened and harassed for years by people who believed the lies told on Jones show

Strangers showed up at their homes to record them People hurled abusive comments on social media Erica Lafferty the daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung testified that people mailed rape threats to her house Mark Barden told of how conspiracy theorists had urinated on the grave of his sevenyearold son Daniel and threatened to dig up the coffin

Testifying during the trial Jones acknowledged he had been wrong about Sandy Hook The shooting was real he said But both in the courtroom and on his show he was defiant

He called the proceedings a kangaroo court mocked the judge called the plaintiffs lawyer an ambulance chaser and labeled the case an affront to free speech rights He claimed it was a conspiracy by Democrats and the media to silence him and put him out of business

Jones now faces a third trial in Texas around the end of the year in a lawsuit filed by the parents of another child killed in the shooting

It is unclear how much of the verdicts Jones can afford to pay During the trial in Texas he testified he couldnt afford any judgment over 2m Free Speech Systems has filed for bankruptcy protection But an economist testified in the Texas proceeding that Jones and his company were worth as much as 270m
We want to give people living with long Covid a voice

So today were launching a new global series Living with long Covid

Weve asked our reporting teams based around the world to talk to long haulers to document their experiences

Well be sharing their stories over the next two weeks But for now what do we know about long Covid

Scientists still understand little about the condition and studies on it often vary in their results But two and a half years since the Covid pandemic began there are some trends starting to become clear

 Older people appear to be at slightly higher risk of developing long Covid symptoms notably kidney problems and mental health conditions according to CDC research But the risk isnt much lower for younger people

 People who were hospitalized with Covid19 are probably at higher risk of developing long Covid symptoms compared with those who were not according to a meta analysis of dozens of studies But even people who had a mild case of Covid have a pretty good chance of experiencing long Covid symptoms

 Women are more likely to develop long Covid symptoms according to the metaanalysis This is in line with previous studies showing women have a higher risk level

 Being vaccinated may reduce your chances of developing long Covid symptoms according to several studies But its not always completely clearcut with one recent study showing a limited impact

Suella Braverman says she has a dream And what is it that she dreams of

At a fringe event at the Tory party conference last week the new home secretary said it was to see a newspaper front page with a picture of a plane taking off to Rwanda deporting people from the UK

Later the same day in her first major speech in her new job Braverman thanked Priti Patel for the foundations she had laid in toughening the immigration system

In an opinion piece for The Guardian academic and author Maya Goodfellow writes Braverman said her ultimate aspiration was to reduce net migration by only allowing immigration that grows our economy  which means the highskilled not the lowskilled kind

We already have a good idea of what this means barring people from moving just because of their qualifications class or how much money they have while bringing in people deemed economically necessary to exploit them as long as it suits the British economy

Last year it was the second most used drug by 1624 year olds in the UK and the rise in supersized canisters  which are around 80 times bigger than the individual canisters  has sparked more concern

The cheap substance which comes in small silver containers is supposed to be used for whipping cream and sometimes as an anaesthetic But in the past decade it is being increasingly used as a drug being inhaled from balloons for a quick high

It is currently legal to possess nitrous oxide in the UK but is illegal to sell it

Russia has launched a massive wave of strikes targeting cities across Ukraine in response to an attack on the Kerch bridge linking Russia and Crimea

Barely hours after the Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced the bridge attack on Saturday as an act of terrorism that he blamed on Ukraines secret services missiles slammed into the Ukrainian capital Kyiv during morning rushhour

President Zelenskiy urged people to take shelter saying Such a time and such targets were specially chosen to cause as much damage as possible Stay in shelters today Always follow the safety rules

Zelenskiy also said the wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities by Russian forces had targeted energy supplies and people and were chosen to cause as much damage to civilians as possible

According to Ukraines military by midmorning on Monday 75 missiles had been launched of which it claimed over 40 had been intercepted
Explosions also rocked the cities of Lviv Ternopil and Dnipro after overnight strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia for the third night in a row

In the immediate aftermath of the first wave of missiles Ukraines defence ministry said it would seek revenge There is sacrifice amongst people and destruction the ministry said on its Facebook page The enemy will be punished for the pain and death brought upon our land We will get our revenge

The last attack on Kyiv was in June leading to a relative return to normality in the city But unlike previous attacks that mostly hit Kyivs outskirts Mondays strikes targeted several locations in the very centre of the city

Iranian schoolchildren were being arrested inside school premises on Sunday by security forces arriving in vans without licence plates according to reports on social media as protests against the regime entered their fourth week  with young women emerging as powerful voices of dissent against the regime

On Friday reports began to surface of the death of a second teenage girl at the hands of security forces in Iran Sarina Esmailzadeh a 16yearold who posted popular vlogs on YouTube was killed when the security forces beat her with batons at a protest in Gohardasht in Alborz province on 23 September according to Amnesty International

The news came after allegations surrounding the circumstances of another 16yearold Nika Shakaramis death had been circulating on social media She was reported missing on 20 September after joining a protest in Tehran amid claims that she had been beaten raped and her body stolen and buried by the regime in a village away from her family

Although the authorities claimed that Shakarami killed herself her mother has accused the security services of murdering her claiming that they tried to force her to say her daughter had taken her own life

Separately officials had also told Esmailzadehs family that investigations had concluded her death was a result of suicide Citing a primary source a statement by Amnesty claimed that her family had been subjected to intense harassment to coerce them into silence claims denied by Iranian officials

Protests started in Kurdish regions of Iran after the death of 22yearold Mahsa Amini in the custody of the countrys feared morality police who had detained her for being in violation of the dress code for women

Irans leaders have attempted to characterise the protests as a foreign plot and a separatist push by a Kurdish minority However a groundswell of people from all walks of life continues to fuel a movement that is drawn from widespread social grievance

From major portraits of the likes of Naomi Campbell FKA Twigs and Tyler the Creator to cover shoots for leading magazines Campbell Addy has quickly become one of the most indemand photographers of his generation

campbelladdy has now released a new book which features his striking imagery woven between trailblazing Black creatives reflecting on the first time they say they felt seen in their industry

The first time I got in front of the camera lens and looked up to see Campbell Addy I realised something special was happening naomi told the Guardian in a 2019 interview

There was something in that moment that felt sacred It occurred to me that this was the first time a Black photographer had shot me for a mainstream publication in my 33andahalfyear career

Gabriella KarefaJohnson who styled Tyler the Creator in this gallery says I spent a lot of time trying to make myself smaller so I could slip through the cracks or camouflage the parts of me that didnt fit Andre Leon Talley the late creative director of Vogue was the first Black person I became aware of who had a seat at the table  at the very top of the mountain  who insisted on taking up space He represented possibility to me

Addy who is also a filmmaker says he balances his own experiences as a queer Black photographer who left his Jehovahs Witness family home at 16 with broader questions of identity intimacy and art which face many creatives today I thought well where do I fit in as an imagemaker Once you get rid of the queer the Black the male whatever then its just my interests The things I like to explore

 In theory my work is about showcasing Its about putting things within my world under the microscope My book is about feeling seen because every person every object needs to be handled with care Thats kind of where the title came from

Addys new book Feeling Seen is out now through Prestel Publishing

In addition to the 41msquarefoot Amazon facility under construction three other Amazon facilities as well as a sprawl of warehouses for FedEx Nike and other companies dot the landscape

The changes have come quickly but also quietly While neighboring communities have been publicly fighting warehouse projects abutting schools and boxing in homes in Ontario many residents said they hadnt noticed just how many new warehouses had cropped up on fallowed fields and along old country roads  until they were surrounded

Ive seen two warehouses go up along my drive to work just since September said Andrea Galvn who lives in an older residential neighborhood in northern Ontario

Microplastics have been detected in human breast milk for the first time with scientists greatly concerned over the potential health impacts on babies

Infants are especially vulnerable to chemical contaminants and the researchers said further studies were urgently needed However they stressed that breastfeeding remains by far the best way to feed a baby

The Italian scientists recorded the mothers consumption of food and drink in plastic packaging and of seafood as well as the use of plasticcontaining personal hygiene products But they found no correlation with the presence of microplastics

This suggests the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the environment makes human exposure inevitable the researchers said

With huge amounts of plastic waste being dumped in the environment microplastics now contaminate the entire planet from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans People consume the tiny particles via food and water as well as breathing them in and they have been found in the faeces of babies and adults

Previous research has shown toxic effects of microplastics in human cell lines lab animals and marine wildlife but the impact on living humans remains unknown

Prof Dick Vethaak who recently led a team at VU University Amsterdam in discovering microplastics presence in human blood warned We see only the tip of the iceberg with microplastics

The chess world has been rocked to its foundations by a scandal involving allegations of cheating dramatic game forfeits and speculation over vibrating anal beads

A chess match that took place last month between the world champion Magnus Carlsen and 19yearold American Hans Niemann has turned into a part soap opera part whodunnit

Carlsen quit the prestigious 500000 447000 Sinquefield Cup after losing to Niemann and then accused the teenager of cheating
Since then a cloud of suspicion has hung over the sport along with increasingly wild theories about cheating using vibrating anal beads

Niemann denies cheating in this game against Carlsen and responded to the rumours by saying They want me to strip fully naked Ill do it I dont care because I know I know that Im clean and Im willing to subject myself to what you want me to play

But Niemann did confess to violating the rules of fair play at least twice in the past by using the assistance of chess engines first as a 12yearold in an online tournament and then as a 16yearold playing unrated games while streaming

Then this week a Chesscom report has offered compelling datadriven evidence that dramatically contradicts those statements The 72page report made no conclusions regarding Niemanns overtheboard games but did flag contests from six of his stronger inperson events stating they merit further investigation based on the data

This scandal has engulfed chess and left fans of the sport fearful for its future as guardiansports chief reporter seanmarkingle explains

This year will be remembered as a watershed year for the escalating climate crisis Dozens of countries have been hit by extreme weather so far in 2022 Millions have been driven from their homes by flood fire or drought while food and energy shortages are becoming acute in many regions

But what has taken us so long for meaningful action to save our planet

People are saying the climate crisis is real only because it has knocked on the door of the global north says Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate

The 54 countries in Africa combined account for 15 of the worlds population but contribute less than 4 of global greenhouse emissions  in contrast to 23 by China 19 by the US and 13 from the European Union Right now more than 18 million people are facing severe hunger due to extreme droughts in the Horn of Africa

The countries suffering the worst effects of climate change are not the ones who caused the climate crisis Here 25yearold vanessanakate1 speaks about about this extreme climate injustice and what needs to be done about it

Cop27 takes place in November this year in Sharm El Sheikh Egypt Countries from across Africa  and the wider global south  will be looking to secure billions of dollars of climate financing for adaptation and the green energy transition as well as separate funds for loss and damage and reparations

What do you think needs to happen

Handmaids tale or an exciting breakthrough

In a world first  a synthetic embryo with a beating heart has been created without the need for sperm eggs and fertilisation

Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Israel found that stem cells from mice could be made to selfassemble into early embryolike structures

The researchers believe the work could also reduce animal experimentation and ultimately pave the way for new sources of cells and tissues for human transplantation For example skin cells from a leukaemia patient could potentially be transformed into bone marrow stem cells to treat their condition

When compared with natural mouse embryos the synthetic embryos were 95 the same in terms of their internal structure and the genetic profiles of the cells As far as the scientists could tell the organs that formed were functional But crucially these synthetic embryos did not have the potential to develop into live animals or at least they hadnt when they had been transplanted into the wombs of female mice

Speaking to StatNews Prof Paul Tesar a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University said the more scientists pushed stem cellderived embryos further and further along the path of development the more the synthetic and natural embryos begin to merge

There will always be a grey area he said But as scientists and as a society we need to come together to decide where the line is and define what is ethically acceptable

New figures have revealed that 40000 ghost planes  planes that fly with less than 10 of passengers  took off or landed in the UK since 2019 with an average of 130 flights a month having no passengers on at all

Campaigners have called these flights a vast waste of money and a needless source of emissions

Following a summer of recordbreaking runwaymelting heat this wanton waste of carbon by airlines flies in the face of those feeling the full brunt of our warming world says Alethea Warrington at climate charity Possible

Airlines do not publish information about why these flights happen prompting campaigners to call for more transparency to understand why these inefficient polluting practices continue and to hold the main airline culprits to account

Putin has just formally annexed the occupied territories of Ukraine in four regions Donetsk Luhansk Kherson and Zaporizhzhia  marking the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war

How did this happen It started when Russia held fake referendums over the last week in order to claim a mandate for the territorial claims which Ukrainians have described as a vote held at gunpoint

Why is Putin doing this Analysts say that Russia is carrying out these annexations as an attempt to halt Ukraines recent successful counterattack

By declaring these territories to be part of Russia Moscow is threatening an overwhelming response including a possible nuclear attack as a part of a defensive war unless Ukraine halts its successful efforts to liberate its own territories By threatening a massive escalation Russia is seeking to slow its losses until its forces can regroup

How has the rest of the world responded to the news Many world leaders have publicly condemned Putins move and the EU announced they reject and unequivocally condemn annexation

US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink has reiterated her countrys opposition to Russias annexations saying We will never recognise Russias purported annexation of Ukrainian territory

Ukrainians living in the four annexed occupied territories have been trying to flee since it became clear that Russia was trying to take control of these areas A civilian convoy of cars heading to pick up relatives trying to flee Russianoccupied territory in Ukraine was hit earlier this morning by Russian forces near the city of Zaporizhzhia with initial reports suggesting at least 25 people have been killed and at least 50 wounded

No one does political rags to riches stories quite like Brazil but even in a nation where the most celebrated president in decades once shined shoes to survive the story of Erika Hilton takes some beating

As a teenager she came out to her family as transgender and was kicked out of her home aged 14 She spent several years as a sex worker in rural Brazil before reconnecting with her mother and studying teaching and gerontology at university 

Discrimination and violence against LGBTQ communities in Brazil are widespread and the country has the highest levels of violence against trans people in the world 

In the face of this stark reality Hilton moved into student politics joined the leftwing PSOL party and in 2020 became the first transgender person elected to the city council Brazils largest

Now as the country heads to the polls in this Sundays general election the activist and politician hopes the vote will not only mark the end of the farright incumbent Jair Bolsonaros presidency but will also see her elected to a Congress with the leftist Lula da Silva at the helm

This is Zaynab Mohammed Ayoub playing with her toys next to the rubble of her demolished home in the Palestinian village of Fahit in Massafer Yattah

After a twodecade legal battle Israels high court ruled in May that about 1000 Palestinians can be evicted from an area of the West Bank and the land repurposed for Israeli military use  The ruling which contravenes international law was one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began in 1967 

Israel designated the 3000ha 7410 acre area of the barren south Hebron hills as a military training zone  Firing Zone 918  in the 1980s After decades of legal battles however four months ago the supreme court finally agreed with the IDFs argument that the people living in Masafer Yatta could not prove they were residents before the firing zone was established

Now the homes and livelihoods of the entire community are at risk and the army together with illegal Israeli settlers is increasing the pressure to try to get the Palestinians to leave

The Ayoub house was demolished by bulldozers in an operation supervised by the Israel Defence Forces a few weeks after the ruling leaving them living in a tent all summer Now they are preparing to relocate into the cave before winter comes 

We have no choice said Mohammed Ayoub the head of the extended family of 17 We have been sleeping in the village clinic since our home was destroyed but we have to find an alternative

Would you trust a cyborg cockroach to save your life

If an earthquake strikes in the nottoodistant future and survivors are trapped under tonnes of rubble the first responders to locate them could be a swarm of cockroaches with backpacks

Thats a potential application of a recent breakthrough by Japanese researchers who have discovered a way to mount solar electronic batteries on the bugs and direct their movements via remote control

The main purpose we think this could be used for is searching for survivors in places where disasters have occurred says senior research scientist Kenjiro Fukuda Senior research scientist

Fukuda and his team chose Madagascar hissing cockroaches for the experiments because they are big enough to carry the equipment and have no wings that would get in the way Even when the backpack and film are glued to their backs the bugs can traverse small obstacles or right themselves when flipped over

Via guardianus there is a rapid acceleration of book censorship occurring across the US with more than 2500 different book bans taking place over the past school year a new report has found

A total of 1648 individual book titles many of them that mention issues relating to race or sexuality were the subject of bans by school districts in 32 states in the last school year according to the new analysis

More than 5000 schools nationally have had books barred from access by students in libraries and classrooms according to the report by Pen America a nonprofit that supports freedom of expression in literature

There has been a proliferation of organized efforts to advocate for book removals the report states from rightwing politicians in states such as Texas Georgia and Wisconsin to at least 50 groups that have sprung up either inperson or on Facebook

Many of the books have been banned for simply featuring people who identify as LGBTQ with a third of all book bans from April to June including people with such identities often under a spurious justification that the titles are obscene Race and discussion of Americas racist past is also a target of book bans with 40 of titles banned featuring prominent characters of color

While we think of book bans as the work of individual concerned citizens our report demonstrates that todays wave of bans represents a coordinated campaign to banish books being waged by sophisticated ideological and wellresourced advocacy organizations said Suzanne Nossel chief executive officer of Pen America

The clothing thats available on the market assumes a very binary world says Wandia Gichuru CEO of Kenyan fashion brand Vivo

Alongside Bold Network Africa the brand has released a vibrant genderless clothing collection called Zoya X Bold It is one of a new crop of collaborations showcasing androgynous fashion

LGBTQ activist Chris Makena Njeri Muriithi CEO of Bold Network Africa  which describes itself as a queer storytelling platform  says that fashion needs to be more inclusive For the longest time I had to go to the mens section to even buy a shirt says Muriithi who is nonbinary

I was bullied on social media for how I used to dress just because it did not conform with what society has shown people to be the norm says Muriithi

Kenyas queer community has been increasingly visible over the past few years after a number of prominent Kenyans came out publicly Celebrities such as Willis Chimano of Afropop band Sauti Sol challenge traditional gender dressing with crop tops low Vnecks bare backs and bodysuits YouTuber Jayson Wamae also embraces fashion fluidity dressing in anything from sheer tops and silk jumpsuits to neck scarves

Muriithi says People need to be able to be who they are without having to be afraid But LGBTQ people face systemic discrimination and violence in Kenya and gender nonconforming people face heightened threats

In April a 25yearold nonbinary lesbian was murdered in a suspected hate crime The following month a 50yearold intersex person was raped and killed Figures by the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission suggest that these are not isolated incidents

Ashton Laurence  pictured above  who modelled the new line faces harassment daily but does not shy away from growing out his hair wearing eyeliner and mesh vests It is an ode to his younger self who he describes as a feminine boy

This isnt a small island 
This is the village of Gabarun in Nigerias northern Jigawa State  almost entirely surrounded by flood water from the Hedejia River

The country is currently battling its worst floods in a decade with more than 300 people killed this year alone  with authorities saying earlier this week that the situation is beyond our control

The floods in 27 of Nigerias 36 states and capital city have affected half a million people including 100000 displaced and more than 500 injured Nigerias National Emergency Management Agency said on Tuesday

The disaster has also destroyed thousands of hectares of farmland worsening fears of a disruption of food supply in Africas most populous country 

Nigeria sees flooding every year often as a result of nonimplementation of environmental guidelines and inadequate infrastructure Authorities are blaming the floods this year on water overflowing from local rivers unusual rainfalls and the release of excess water from Lagdo dam in neighbouring Cameroons northern region

The floods have also destroyed crops mostly in Nigerias northern region which produces much of what the country eats raising concerns that they could further affect food supplies already disrupted by armed conflict in the countrys northwest and central regions

In the Benue state Aondongu Kwaghbee 30 said he visited his rice farm recently and discovered that a heavy downpour had wiped away everything

Right now there is nothing there Just sand filled up and the rice has been washed away

According to the Russian human rights group OVDInfo more than 1300 people have been arrested across the country

In an anticipated TV address early on Wednesday the Russian president announced a partial mobilisation and also threatened nuclear retaliation saying we will use all the means at our disposal

His speech came after a rapid reversal in the Kharkiv region where Ukraine has pushedback Russian forces claiming to have retaken control of the entire province

Lets have no illusions We are in rough seas A winter of global discontent is on the horizon a costofliving crisis is raging trust is crumbling inequalities are exploding and our planet is burning

In his most urgent and bleakest speech to date on the state of the planet the head of the United Nations Antonio Guterres said it was high time to put fossil fuel producers investors and enablers on notice as he called for a global windfall tax to support countries struggling with climate disasters and rising living costs

Speaking at the UN general assembly on Tuesday the secretary general said that polluters must pay for the escalating damage caused by heatwaves floods drought and other climate impacts and demanded that it was high time to put fossil fuel producers investors and enablers on notice 

Today I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies he said adding that those funds should be redirected in two ways  to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices

Vladimir Putin has announced a partial mobilisation in Russia in a significant escalation that places the countrys people and economy on a wartime footing

The president also threatened nuclear retaliation saying Moscow had lots of weapons to reply to what he called western threats on its territory and added that he was not bluffing

In a highly anticipated televised address Putin said this was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west that wants to destroy our country and claimed the west had tried to turn Ukraines people into cannon fodder

Putins decision has sent shockwaves across Russia Since the start of the invasion the Russian president has sought to shield his population from the grim realities of war with the Kremlin eager to cultivate a sense of normality on the streets of Moscow and other major cities

But with the decision to announce a partial mobilisation and the callup of 300000 mostly young Russian men the war will now enter the household of many families across the country

Will anybody be held accountable for the Champions League chaos

On 28 May 2022 the final between Real Madrid and Liverpool took place at the Stade de France in Paris But the showpiece match between two great clubs was disfigured by chaotic organisation in which Liverpool supporters suffered a near disaster and as riot police teargassed spectators while failing to protect people from violent attacks by local thugs

Yet the French government police and Uefa united instantly to put the blame on Liverpool supporters claiming that the problems were caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets Echoes of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 97 people were unlawfully killed but the South Yorkshire police falsely blamed Liverpool supporters were inescapable

Uefa has issued a sincere apology to spectators who had to experience or witness frightening and distressing events but has not admitted to any failings or retracted its statements blaming Liverpool supporters

Two official reports in France have severely criticised the police operation but not contested the official claims of industrial scale ticket fraud

Our team has put together the fullest visual account yet of a traumatic night based on detail in the official reports testimony given to the French senate extensive video footage and interviews with supporters witnesses and experts Click the link in our bio to see the full interactive piece by guardiansport  and to read David Conns exclusive report on how Uefa preprepared Champions League final statement blaming late fans

Mahsa Amini a 22yearold from Irans Kurdistan province fell into a coma and died following her arrest in Tehran last week by the morality police for unsuitable attire sparking nationwide anger and demonstrations in numerous areas including the capital

In the Kurdish region the rights organisation Hengaw said there were protests in 13 cities on Monday and that 250 people had been arrested Hengaw gave the names of three people who it said had been killed during protests in three different cities including Aminis hometown of Saqez There was not official confirmation of the deaths The reports could not be immediately independently verified

Videos posted on social media have shown demonstrations in numerous cities with women waving their headscarves and protesters facing off with security forces

The news comes weeks after Irans hardline president Ebrahim Raisi ordered a crackdown on womens rights and called for stricter enforcement of the countrys mandatory dress code which has required all women to wear the hijab headcovering since the 1979 Islamic revolution

Iranian media is now rife with debate about the accountability of the morality police

The police deny beating Amini and it was claimed by the interior ministry that she collapsed due to a heart condition But her father has repeatedly said his daughter had no health problems adding that she had suffered bruises to her legs He held the police responsible for her death

On Monday the Tehran police commander described her death as an unfortunate incident while rejecting what he said were cowardly accusations against the police

Prince George nine and Princess Charlotte seven have taken a prominent role at their great grandmothers funeral

The pair could be seen in a car following the procession with the Queen consort and their mother the Princess of Wales  and also walked behind the coffin during the Queens state funeral at Westminster Abbey

Charlottes presence was a reminder of how the Queens reign ended hundreds of years of male primogeniture in the British monarchy

From 2013 a younger son could no longer displace an elder daughter in the line of succession meaning that Charlotte is third in line to the throne and her younger brother Louis who was not at the funeral is fourth

After the funeral a procession travelled behind the Queens coffin to the Wellington Arch After the pomp and almost continual musical accompaniment of earlier the national anthem was played for a final time and a royal salute was given as the hearse departed to Windsor Castle

The committal service will begin at 4pm at St Georges Chapel Windsor before the Queen is lowered into the royal vault where she will lay to rest alongside her husband and parents

I was labelled outrageous because I fell in love with a woman

In a memoir Anne Heche worked on over the past year the late actor shared candid thoughts on her relationship with Ellen DeGeneres in the late 1990s when they were among Hollywoods first openly gay couples

In her lifetime Heche said that she was effectively blacklisted by the industry because of her relationship with DeGeneres who around the same time made television history by having her character in the sitcom Ellen come out as gay The couple dated between 1997 and 2000

I did not personally identify as a lesbian I simply fell in love It was to be clear as odd to me as anyone else There were no words to describe how I felt Heche wrote in her upcoming book which is a sequel to her 2001 memoir Call Me Crazy

Heche whose films included Donnie Brasco and Wag the Dog died in August at 53 a week after crashing her car into a house in Los Angeles Her death was ruled an accident by the coroner

The Queen is to lie in state for four days at Westminster Hall after her coffin was carried there from Buckingham Palace on a horsedrawn gun carriage

As thousands of people queued on Wednesday to pay their last respects Big Ben tolled every minute and King Charles and his siblings the Princess Royal the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex walked directly to the rear of the coffin followed by the Prince of Wales the Duke of Sussex and Peter Phillips the son of the Princess Royal

Unlike his siblings who wore ceremonial military uniforms Prince Andrew who became a nonworking royal after the scandal of his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein the convicted sex offender wore a morning suit adorned with honours including the South Atlantic medal a reminder of his military service in the 1982 Falklands war

The Queens grandsons followed the same route down the Mall and Whitehall 25 years ago when as children they followed their mothers coffin on foot to her funeral after she was killed in a car crash in Paris On that day Prince Harry was 12 and William 15

The Duke of Sussex wore morning dress as a result of protocol that nonworking royals cannot wear military uniforms at such public occasions Reporting of that fact appeared to irk the duke and a spokesperson for him issued a statement late on Tuesday that appeared to ask the press to stop talking about it

His decade of military service is not determined by the uniform he wears and we respectfully ask that focus remain on the life and legacy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II they said The duke served as an army captain and was deployed on two tours of Afghanistan

It was ludicrous

In London Paul Powlesland a barrister and climate activist who had held up a blank piece of paper near parliament said he had been threatened with arrest by a police officer if he added the words Not my King to his sign

Civil liberties campaigners and others have expressed alarm about the response of police to antimonarchy protesters after a number of incidents one of which included the arrest and subsequent dearrest of Symon Hill for shouting Who elected him when the proclamation of King Charles III was read out in Oxford

Powlesland told the Guardian on Monday night that he had had quite a long discussion with the police who had stopped him who were from Norfolks force Normally you can get into trouble for shouting but if you have something written that is superfactual and which is not abusive then you would normally think that you are protected Its pure free speech

I think the idea that he could arrest me and that there could be a conviction under the Public Order Act was ludicrous but interventions like that are having a chilling effect Powlesland added

The Metropolitan police on Monday night appeared to acknowledge the reaction to Powleslands tweets after they had gone viral issuing a statement saying it was was aware of video showing an officer speaking to a member of the public at the Palace of Westminster

The public absolutely have a right to protest and we have been making this clear to all officers involved in the extraordinary policing operation currently in place and we will continue to do so said the deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Cundy

News of Queen Elizabeths death was not wholly unexpected She lived to the great age of 96 After enjoying markedly good health for so long the oldest monarch in British history had recently appeared more fragile She had understandably become a more private woman since the death of Prince Philip last year and had been less publicly visible undertaking lighter duties All of us knew that this moment was approaching

It arrives nevertheless as a national shock but also as a shared moment of reflection and as the start of a new and unwritten chapter for the British monarchy and the country itself The Queens death brings personal loss for those close to her and she had also been a constant presence in millions of lives

As Queen of the UK and 14 other realms and head of the 54nation Commonwealth Elizabeth II was easily the worlds most recognisable head of state during an extraordinarily long reign

Coming to the throne at the age of 25 she successfully steered the monarchy through decades of turbulent change with her personal popularity providing ballast during the institutions more difficult times

Fifteen prime ministers served her attesting to her deep knowledge experience of world affairs and mastery of political neutrality They stretched back to Sir Winston Churchill who was still prime minister when she assumed the throne with resolve and far earlier than she had expected on the premature death of her father George VI in 1952

As many nations today mourn a queen one family is mourning a mother of four a grandmother of eight and a greatgrandmother of 12

On McCurdys photorealistic painting style Obama noted how he captures every wrinkle of your face every crease of your shirt and youll note he refused all of my requests to make my ears smaller he said

He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit by the way Obama added to laughter and applause a nod to the social media firestorm that occurred when he wore such a suit in 2014

Meanwhile Michelle hailed the portraits as a reminder of American opportunity saying theres a place for everyone in this country If the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world she said it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can too

Last week the UN high commissioner for human rights released a longawaited report on abuses in Xinjiang The 45page document was published years after the world first learned of a huge crackdown on Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang including mass detention reeducation and religious and cultural oppression

From the time of receiving the first notifications to publication the report took half a decade to compile It determined that the Chinese government had been committing longrunning human rights abuses against Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minorities likely to the level of crimes against humanity

The report demolished Beijings counterterrorism framework which it used to justify the crackdown in Xinjiang and found credible evidence of torture and assault mass arbitrary detention forced medical procedures and credible indications of coerced family planning including forced sterilisation

Victims and rights groups had feared a watereddown report  and have since criticised UN for failing to label the treatment as genocide

As the report was released Dawut was protesting alongside other Uyghur exiles in Washington DC The report was all we could think about Dawut said via video link We were eager to find out about how reflective it would be about what has happened to our people Any kind of crime you can think of is happening to Uyghurs

The Chinese government has named Dawut in press conferences releasing personal information and photos and calling her a liar She  like many others  has cut off contact with loved ones for their protection

The man of steal

As Chilean president Gabriel Boric gave a speech imploring people to vote in support of major progressive changes to the countrys constitution a young boy dressed as superman stole the show

The boy who is reportedly in the foster care of Borics mother appears to have no idea about the significance of the speech going on 

The viral clip was recorded last week before Chileans voted against the new constitution which had been drafted to replace the 1980 document written under Gen Augusto Pinochets dictatorship

It enshrined gender parity across government and other organs of the state  for the first time anywhere in the world  prioritised environmental protection and recognised Chiles Indigenous peoples for the first time in the countrys history

Many criticised the documents guarantees for Indigenous people which they said would divide Chile Others warned that the shakeup of the political system was unnecessary and experimental

ChileanAmerican novelist Ariel Dorfman writes It was the most ecologically advanced such founding document in world history granting personhood to nature protecting rivers and air and forests 

It extended democracy established gender parity and popular participation granted Indigenous peoples the recognition they had been denied for centuries lovingly answered the need for universal health care decent education and pension funds access to water sovereignty over mineral resources the care for animals and children  things that generations of Chileans have been fighting for

But despite this progress some myths about mental illnesses are still widely shared including false claims about the efficacy of treatments

I remember being soaking wet lying under the tarp as ocean hit us and the rain poured down

New Australian MP daile was met with support after speaking emotionally on her experience as a refugee

Wearing what appeared to be a traditional o di Vietnamese dress made out of the Australian flag Le held back tears as she described fleeing Vietnam with her family in 1975 age seven boarding wooden boats to the Philippines and then Hong Kong

I remember my sister and I hanging on to dear life while my mother held my other sister tightly in her arms with her rosary beads praying I remember how my face almost hit the ocean as our boat rocked so hard from the storm

She also described living for years in refugee camps before being accepted to resettle in Australia

Le went on to speak of her feelings of gratitude and freedom at coming to live in the country

This migration story belongs to all of us Its our story and we can all be proud to share it

Le who represents the culturally diverse but low income area of Fowler went on to criticise that her western Sydney community was subjected to more harsh conditions by the state government than wealthier areas in the citys eastern suburbs during the 2021 lockdowns

She said her community were the forgotten people and yet we are the backbone of Australia

Her speech was greeted with supporters in Parliament Houses public galleries clapping shouting and chanting her name

But the euphoria of victory will quickly give way to the hard reality of the economic challenges ahead with the country gripped by a cost of living crisis leaving families struggling to pay their energy bills this winter

Analysts have been quick to point out that Truss has not offered a great amount of detail on her plans so far  and that she has often flipflopped on her policies and views

In a postRoe America would you trust a period tracker

Nearly a third of American women use period tracking apps according to a 2019 survey published by the Kaiser Family Foundation

They have helped make womens lives easier in many ways from family planning and detecting early signs of health issues to choosing their preferred time for a holiday

However many women in the US have been deleting their apps amid fears of their data being used against them in criminal cases in states where abortion is illegal

Period tracking apps tend to collect all of data from their users Flo one of the most popular period tracking apps in the US has come under fire in the past for sharing its users data after a Wall Street Journal investigation found that the app informed Facebook when a user was on their period or if they intended to get pregnant

That said privacy experts believe that its still possible for these apps to change their ways

They should never have owned so much data in the first place If they adopted practices like storing data locally and minimizing the data to whats strictly necessary we wouldnt be having this debate now Its not too late for them to do the right thing said Eva BlumDumontet a tech policy consultant

Until then experts believe that the risk in using thirdparty period tracking apps remain

According to Jonathan Lord UK medical director for MSI Reproductive Choices the danger will persist until we treat abortion like all other healthcare  regulated like all other medical procedures but not criminalized

Down in the oceans shadowy depths this fish gazes up towards the surface through its transparent head with eyes like mesmerising emerald orbs 

These domes are huge spherical lenses that sit on a pair of long silvery eye tubes  hence its common name the barreleye fish

The green tint of this fishs eyes acts almost like sunglasses helping it track down its prey in the ocean water above it

With nowhere to hide in the open waters of the deep ocean many animals living there have glowing bellies that help erase their shadow  bioluminescent prey are hard to spot against the dim blue sunlight trickling down But barreleyes are one step ahead

Their eye pigment allows the fish to distinguish between sunlight and bioluminescence says Bruce Robison deepsea biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California

While they appear to constantly be looking up barreleye fish can also rotate their eyes to track their prey through the water until theyre right in front of their mouths

So how easy is it to encounter barreleyes in the wild Unsurprisingly not very

Ever thought about eating an insect

While mealworms have until now mostly been used as snacks for pets or as bait while fishing scientists say they have potential as a sustainable and highprotein food source for humans

A new study found that the flavour of insects can be altered depending on the different ways you cook them

Theres even a method for giving insects a meaty taste

Scientists hope the recognisable flavours of meat will encourage people to start eating more insects instead of highly polluting traditional meat diets

When Grace Velez went to work wearing pigtails she expected a typical shift

Instead she received lots of sexualised comments from male customers and unwarranted winks and went home with double the number of tips she usually gets 

Eventually gracevv realised that the new hairstyle might have something to do with it

After sharing her story on TikTok Grace inspired the pigtail experiment in which women shared their experiences of being sexualised while wearing pigtails in the service industry

I think there needs to be more awareness and protection around the fetishisation of women at work says Grace

The world is in the grip of an unprecedented hunger crisis

The United Nations said last month that the number of people going hungry in the world had risen by 150 million since the start of the Covid pandemic

There are growing concerns that the food crisis sparked by Russias invasion of Ukraine will push the worsthit countries into famine

We thought it couldnt get any worse But this war has been devastating says David Beasley director of the UN World Food Programme WFP

The result will be global destabilisation starvation and mass migration on an unprecedented scale he warned We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe

But there are fears that the humanitarian sector wont be able to give enough aid to countries because of the lack of funding from donor countries

WFPs spokesman for east Africa Michael Dunford said he thought there had been learnings from past hunger crises but we havent been able to implement it to the extent required because of the lack of funding

Mikhail Gorbachev who ended the cold war without bloodshed but failed to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union has died at the age of 91 Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday

Gorbachevs office said earlier that he was undergoing treatment at the hospital

Gorbachev the last Soviet president forged arms reduction deals with the United States and partnerships with western powers to remove the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since the second world war and bring about the reunification of Germany

When prodemocracy protests swept across the Soviet bloc nations of communist Eastern Europe in 1989 Gorbachev refrained from using force unlike previous Kremlin leaders who had sent tanks to crush uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 Reuters reports

But the protests fuelled aspirations for autonomy in the 15 republics of the Soviet Union which disintegrated over the next two years in chaotic fashion

On becoming general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in 1985 aged just 54 he had set out to revitalise the system by introducing limited political and economic freedoms but his reforms spun out of control

His policy of glasnost  free speech  allowed previously unthinkable criticism of the party and the state but also emboldened nationalists who began to press for independence in the Baltic republics of Latvia Lithuania Estonia and elsewhere

Gorbachev spent much of the last two decades on the political periphery intermittently calling for the Kremlin and the White House to mend ties as tensions soared to Cold War levels since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and launched an offensive in Ukraine earlier this year AFP reports

He spent the twilight years of his life in and out of hospital with increasingly fragile health and observed selfquarantine during the pandemic as a precaution against coronavirus

The nation is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948  with massive political upheaval widespread protests and shortages of basic necessities including food fuel and medicine

But in the tough months ahead Sri Lankans may draw strength from their ability to grin at tragedies and laugh at their fears writes author Shehan Karunatilaka  adding that it can be an effective way of deposing tyrant and prevent the state from having the last laugh  even if the depressing truth lies beyond the caricatures

The reality is life is going to get a lot more harsh

Even in a year where energy prices have dominated the news agenda this is a significant day Ofgem the UK industry regulator is due to announce a change to the energy price cap  with prices expected to go up from October to an annual maximum of more than 3500 That number could be a staggering 5300 by the new year

For almost anyone those prices will make a difference to their standard of living But for the most vulnerable such exorbitant costs will have a profound impact and in many cases make an already difficult situation impossible

Since June the Guardians weve been hearing from some of those at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis contributors to the Guardians heat or eat diaries about the struggles they are already facing  and their fears for the immediate future

Ancient dinosaur footprints dating back more than 100m years have been revealed in Texas

Multiple tracks belonging to the Acrocanthosaurus dinosaur were discovered recently at Dinosaur Valley state park in northwest Texas as widespread droughts have caused a river running through central Texas to dry up almost entirely

The 15ft seventon creature once inhabited the area over 113m years ago confirmed the state park in an email to NBC News

About 60 prints from the Acroanthosaurus have been revealed with an estimated 149 tracks from the dinosaur in total the BBC reported

Tracks from the Acrocanthosaurus had not been seen since 2000 with the prints hidden under layers of water and sediment though visitors can sometimes see other dinosaur tracks at the state park depending on weather conditions according to the parks website

Prints from the Sauroposeidon a 66ft creature that once weighed about 48 tons when fully matured were also discovered Experts believe that the Acrocanthosaurus preyed on Sauroposeidon explaining why their prints were discovered together

Depleting water levels have uncovered other discoveries besides dinosaur prints In Lake Mead human remains and a ship dating back to the second world war were discovered as water levels fell during the longstanding drought

What happens when we outsource part of our memory to an external device

Does it enable us to squeeze more and more out of life because we arent as reliant on our fallible brains to cue things up for us Are we so reliant on smartphones that they will ultimately change how our memories work sometimes called digital amnesia Or do we just occasionally miss stuff when we dont remember the reminders

Our brains and our smartphones form a complex web of interactions the smartphonification of life has been rising since the mid 2000s but was accelerated by the pandemic as was internet use in general

Prolonged periods of stress isolation and exhaustion  common themes since March 2020  are well known for their impact on memory Of those surveyed by memory researcher Catherine Loveday in 2021 80 felt that their memories were worse than before the pandemic

We are  still  shattered not just by Covid19 but also by the miserable national and global news cycle Many of us selfsoothe with distractions like social media Meanwhile endless scrolling can at times create its own distress and phone notifications and self interrupting to check for them also seem to affect what how and if we remember

I am human And I too sometimes long for joy light and fun amidst these dark clouds

Finlands prime minister Sanna Marin fought back tears today as she gave a forceful defence of her work record and her right to a private life following recent criticisms she has faced over a leaked video of her partying

The clips which were leaked last week showed her dancing exuberantly with friends and drinking at a party at which unsubstantiated reports claimed drugs may have been circulating

Marin 36 who was delivering a speech at her Social Democratic Partys SDP event in Lahti city north of Helsinki also apologised for the second time in a week yesterday after a photograph of two topless women taken at a party inside the Finnish prime ministers official residence last month was published on social media

Following the video leak the prime minister volunteered for a drugs test for my own legal protection and to clear up any doubts She passed But in the fallout of the scandal Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi has called into question the apparent sexist double standards at play

While Boris Johnson having multiple children with numerous women is dismissed as boys will be boys a woman having fun at home with her friends is treated like an untrustworthy hedonist writes Mahdawi

Many travellers trek to remote destinations in search of the perfect picture
But at what cost

When photographer natachademahieu arrived at the edge of Obersee a remote German lake surrounded by lush green mountains and dramatic waterfalls in August last year she was confronted by the idea of Instagram versus reality

It was chilly and rain was pelting down but as tourists came and took photos of themselves against the view De Mahieu noticed how many would shed their layers in defiance of the cold to convey the image of a blissful summer

For a photo series as part of a project for her masters degree in documentary photography De Mahieu went to some of the most geotagged European tourist destinations on Instagram

Instead of trying to get the perfect shot she used Photoshop to produce a timelapse collage that showed the reality of all the people who had visited the area over a period of time

The series which she calls Theatre of Authenticity is a commentary on how social media can transform places into mustsee destinations  and how an influencers Instagram post can open the floodgates

I wanted to show the impact of that kind of invisible tourism on these places When I say invisible I mean that when youre there you have a feeling that you are alone But over an hour or an afternoon there are a lot of people going there she says

For example De Mahieus image of the Pont dArc a large natural bridge in Ardche southeast France was made from photographs taken over a period of 80 minutes at the height of the tourist season The final result made from 100 images took more than a week to complete

Pavel Filatyev knew the consequences of what he was saying

The exparatrooper understood he was risking prison that he would be called a traitor His own mother had urged him to flee Russia while he still could

I simply cant stay quiet any longer even though I know that I probably wont change anything and maybe Ive acted foolishly to get myself in so much trouble Filatyev told the Guardian

Until now there has been no more detailed voluntary account from a Russian soldier participating in the invasion of Ukraine

After spending 45 days writing his memoirs from the conflict Filatyev said I am just terrified of what happens next

The Guardian has not been able to independently verify all the details of his story but he has supplied documents and photographs showing he was a paratrooper with the 56th airborne regiment stationed in Crimea that he was hospitalised with an eye injury sustained while performing special tasks in Ukraine in April and that he had written directly to the Kremlin with his complaints about the war before going public

The worst disaster on Earth

This is how the head of the World Health Organization described the crisis in Ethiopias Tigray region as he wondered aloud if the reason global leaders had not responded was the colour of the skin of the people

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus  himself an ethnic Tigrayan  described the Ukraine conflict as a crisis that had the global community potentially sleepwalking into a nuclear war that could be the mother of all problems but argued the disaster in Tigray was far worse

The conflict in Ethiopia began in November 2020 and little humanitarian aid arrived after Tigray forces retook much of the region in June 2021

What Were You Wearing

This is the title sexual assault survivors have given a powerful new exhibit showcasing the outfits they were wearing when they were attacked

Their aim is to tackle victimblame culture and to shatter the myth that sexual assault can be attributed to a persons choice in wardrobe

I want people to come to a reckoning that it is not the victims fault that it could literally be anyone says amandangocnguyen  one of the survivors behind the exhibit hosted at the UN headquarters in New York which invites viewers to guess which outfits are the real ones worn by survivors and which are not

But the point of it is that you cannot tell she adds

Nguyen CEO and founder of risenowus and 2019 Nobel peace prize nominee has fought for years to make sure survivors are protected and taken seriously  especially in the current climate where rights that have been fought are being rolled back It is a scary time

I want people to know that theyre not alone when they walk through the exhibit Yes on one hand it is terrifying to see that so many of us have experienced this horrific act of violence But on the other hand I also want people to understand that there is solidarity And I know that when we work together we can push for change

Nguyen along with other survivors who decided to wave their anonymity told their stories to world leaders when the exhibition opened in the hopes of passing the worlds first international protections for victims of sexual assault

At midnight on 1415 August 1947 the largest recorded forced migration began Millions of Hindus Muslims and Sikhs were forced to journey hundreds of miles with many experiencing brutal violence as the Indian subcontinent was divided into two independent nation states Hindumajority India and Muslimmajority Pakistan Communities that had coexisted for a thousand years succumbed to an eruption of sectarian violence

And in the five years since the 70th anniversary of partition there has been a quiet awakening to its hidden past among the descendants of those who lived through it writes Kavita Puri

Its not you its your car

The SUV is the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade Its also the new target of a group that calls itself the Tyre Extinguishers

We followed the group on a searingly hot night in New York as its masked members took to the streets of the Upper East Side to take part in the biggest deflation operation yet in the US

The amount of damage from a flat tyre is nothing compared to climate change said one member as they moved away from the first deflation Why do you need an SUV especially in New York Its a vanity thing You have freedom of choice sure but you dont have freedom from consequences

The Tyre Extinguishers movement started in the UK spread to a clutch of other countries and has now landed in the US Since June dozens of SUV and pickup truck owners in New York the San Francisco Bay area and Chicago have discovered their vehicles with flat tyres along with a note on the windshield declaring Your gas guzzler kills

The leaflet complete with a Ghostbustersstyle picture of a crossedout SUV states the vast amounts of planetheating emissions generated by the vehicles are nails in the coffin of our climate adding Youll be angry but dont take it personally Its not you its your car

As you might imagine not everyone is a fan of the activist group We need a larger vehicle because I have two sons that are special needs explained Quanda EllisWalker who had her tyre deflated in California It was terrifying to know that someone would come and do this to you

Meanwhile other critics are less measured with their words Since hitting the streets the Tyre Extinguishers US operation has been flooded with insults and even death threats One message vowed to deflate your lungs

The death threats arent a big concern among the activists however People have emailed if you fuck up my SUV I will kill you which I get a kick out of to be honest says a member called Alex Youre not going to find me Its like why are you so mad

Author Salman Rushdie has been attacked onstage at an event in New York state

Rushdie the author whose writing led to death threats from Iran in the 1980s was attacked on Friday morning as he was about to give a lecture in western New York

An Associated Press reporter witnessed a man storm the stage at the Chautauqua Institution and begin punching or stabbing Rushdie as he was being introduced

The author was taken or fell to the floor and the man was restrained

Photos taken by an Associated Press reporter show Rushdie lying flat with a first responder crouched over him

Rushdies book The Satanic Verses has been banned in Iran since 1988 as many Muslims consider it to be blasphemous

A year later Irans late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa or edict calling for Rushdies death

A bounty of more than 3m has also been offered for anyone who kills Rushdie

Irans government has long since distanced itself from Khomeinis decree but antiRushdie sentiment has lingered

In 2012 a semiofficial Iranian religious foundation raised the bounty for Rushdie from 28m to 33m

That year Rushdie published a memoir Joseph Anton about the fatwa

At first glimpse one would think this is a grey chaotic city But grey defines more than just one colour And So Paulo has many shades of grey

With a lack of public spaces in this crowded Brazilian city conquering new places for pleasure is seen as essential to survive the concrete jungle

Thats perhaps why the Elevado Joo Goulart a twomile viaduct mostly known as the Minhoco  after a legendary monster worm  has become an important meeting point for locals

Due to its proximity to peoples homes many complained about the rising car noise in a city where motor transport domination was and is still booming

But at night and on the weekends the viaduct is opened to pedestrians With no cars rushing in the upper part people can walk run cycle skate or even sunbathe in bikinis a bit closer to the sun  which is likely the reason some call it praia Paulistana  their concrete beach

Photographer Pablo Albarenga who moved to So Paulo  the worlds fourth most populous city  during the pandemic says he was caught by the relationship that people had with that huge mass of concrete surrounded by more concrete shining under the direct sunlight

And now after more than 50 years since being planned and built during the Brazilian dictatorship the viaducts destiny is still uncertain as it is being taken over by pedestrians It could be demolished it could also become a park Swipe across to read some stories of the Paulistanos who have adopted this concrete jungle as their oasis

Serena Williams has confirmed she will retire from tennis after an eradefining career that has seen her win 23 grand slam singles titles

The 40yearold broke the news in an article for Vogue published on Tuesday

I have never liked the word retirement Williams wrote Maybe the best word to describe what Im up to is evolution Im here to tell you that Im evolving away from tennis toward other things that are important to me

Williams said her decision had been influenced by the desire to expand her family She gave birth to her first child Olympia in 2017

I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family I dont think its fair Williams wrote If I were a guy I wouldnt be writing this because Id be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family

In the article Williams suggested her final tournament will be the US Open which starts later this month and runs through to the start of September

Williams and her sister Venus burst on to the tennis scene as teenagers shaking up what had been a traditionally white sport 

Between them they won 30 grand slam singles titles They also combined to win 14 major doubles titles Serena won her last grand slam title at the Australian Open in 2017 She has struggled with injuries in recent years and was beaten in the first round of this summers Wimbledon by Harmony Tan

Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia NewtonJohn Foundation Fund dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer

In 2017 NewtonJohn revealed the breast cancer she had first suffered in 1992 had returned andhad spread to her spine She also revealed shed had a second cancer diagnosis in 2013 but had kept it quiet She said she believed she would win over it and called upon her native Australia to adopt the laws of the US state where she then lived California to allow the medicinal use of marijuana

My dream is that in Australia soon it will be available to all the cancer patients and people going through cancer that causes pain she said adding that though she had moments of despair she had had an incredible career and nothing to complain about

After her first cancer diagnosis NewtonJohn became a prominent campaigner setting up the Olivia NewtonJohn Cancer and Wellness Research Centre in Melbourne Her prominence as an activist for research and better treatment will likely remain as key an element of her legacy as her showbiz career which included four Grammy wins and the sale of more than 100m records

But it was Grease the perky 1978 adaptation of the Broadway musical for which she will be most fondly remembered

All they had given her was a plastic bag with her bra and knickers in that had been cut into pieces where theyd cut the underwear off of her

This was part of an interview one mother gave to the BBCs Today programme about the ordeal her 15yearold daughter faced when stripsearched by Metropolitan police officers

New data has revealed that 650 children were stripsearched by Met police over a twoyear period and the majority were found to be innocent of the suspicions against them

Olivia not her real name was menstruating when she was handcuffed and searched in front of male officers after more than 20 hours in custody

The incident happened in December 2020 the same month that a 15yearold black girl known as Child Q was stripsearched while menstruating by Met officers at her school in Hackney east London

Following widespread outrage the childrens commissioner for England launched an investigation  and her report was published today Dame Rachel de Souza has said she was not convinced that the force was consistently considering childrens welfare and wellbeing after the police data showed that in almost a quarter of cases 23 an appropriate adult was not present during the search despite this being a requirement under statutory guidance

I am also extremely concerned by the ethnic disproportionality shown in these figures particularly given that ethnicity was determined to be such a key factor in the Child Q case De Souza says

A Met police statement said The Metropolitan police is progressing at pace work to ensure children subject to intrusive searches are dealt with appropriately and respectfully We recognise the significant impact such searches can have

Whats the word for when you suddenly become aware of how small you are in comparison with the universe

This is a photo of the Cartwheel Galaxy which is about 500m light years away from our planet and is 15 times the size of our galaxy the Milky Way

The incredible image was captured by Nasas triumphant James Webb space telescope  the most powerful space observatory built to date You can also see two smaller galaxies against a backdrop of many other galaxies

The Cartwheel which has been studied by scientists for decades looks like a wheel because hundreds of millions of years ago two galaxies collided

A smaller galaxy plunged through the heart of a large spiral galaxy creating expanding ripples of star formation

The Cartwheel Galaxy sports two rings  a bright inner ring and a surrounding colourful ring These two rings expand outwards from the centre of the collision like ripples in a pond after a stone is tossed into it Because of these distinctive features astronomers call this a ring galaxy a structure less common than spiral galaxies like our Milky Way says Nasa

The Cartwheel is continually expanding and new stars are being formed inside of it Theres no telling how large it will become

Harun Tulunay a sexual health worker contracted monkeypox in early June

He suffered severe symptoms of the virus including fever aches and blisters but is now fully recovered and back to health

The monkeypox outbreak has hit Europe the hardest with cases rising every day Cases have also been reported in the US Canada Australia Nigeria Israel Brazil Mexico and other countries

While anyone can get monkeypox the virus is largely spreading among men who have sex with men particularly those who report having new or multiple sexual partners

The number of cases around the world is increasing and the World Health Organization has called the outbreak a global health emergency

The science of attribution has delivered a bleak but undeniable picture of how global heating is already bringing death and destruction

But what about the future

The devastating intensification of extreme weather is laid bare today in a Guardian analysis that shows how people across the world are losing their lives and livelihoods due to more deadly and more frequent heatwaves floods wildfires and droughts brought by the humandriven climate crisis

carbonbrief compiled a new database of attribution studies of more than 500 events  every such study available  and shared it exclusively with the Guardian The analysis  the most comprehensive compilation to date  demonstrates beyond any doubt how humanitys vast carbon emissions are forcing the climate into disastrous new realms

At least a dozen of the most serious events from killer heatwaves to broiling seas would have been all but impossible without humancaused global heating our research found

Most worryingly all this is happening with a rise of just 1C in the planets average temperature The role of global heating in supercharging extreme weather is happening at astonishing speed scientists say

The world is currently on track for a rise of at least 25C

From a gummy squirrel to soft coral 

Scientists have discovered more than 30 potentially new species living at the bottom of the sea

Researchers from the UKs Natural History Museum used a remotely operated vehicle to collect specimens from the abyssal plains of the ClarionClipperton Zone that extends between Hawaii and Mexico Previously creatures from this area had been studied only from photographs

The animals found include segmented worms invertebrates from the same family as centipedes marine animals from the same family as jellyfish and different types of coral

The findings have potentially important implications for deepsea mining as humans become more interested in exploiting minerals from the seabed because it seems the activity has the potential to disturb many creatures

The studys lead author Dr Guadalupe BribiescaContreras of the Natural History Museum said This research is important not only due to the number of potentially new species discovered but because these megafauna specimens have previously only been studied from seabed images Without the specimens and the DNA data they hold we cannot properly identify the animals and understand how many different species there are

On Tuesday night scenes of jubilation broke as Kansans secured a huge win for abortion rights in the US when they voted to continue to protect abortion in the state constitution

Kansas  a deeply conservative and usually reliably Republican state  is the first US state to put abortion rights to a vote since the supreme court ruled to overturn constitutional protections for abortion in late June

Were free shouted Mafutari Oneal 56 who was working at a bar in Kansas City hosting a watch party for the victorious No campaign

The state will remain a safe haven for abortion in the midwest as one of the few states in the region where it remains legal to perform the procedure Many other states have undertaken moves to make abortion largely illegal since June

The last time any England football team won a major international tournament was in 1966 That was at a time when women were banned from playing competitively in any form

Last night it was Englands womens team who took the country all the way and brought the silverware home

As Guardian sportswriter Jonathan Liew writes Now against the same opponents in the same stadium English football  all of it not just half  has ascended to the very top step of the podium

He continues As England celebrated the tableau that greeted us at Wembley would have been unthinkable even a few years ago Women commentating on television Women tapping away in the press box Women officiating women coaching on the touchline women bellowing in the stands Over the last few weeks these sights have become normalised because they are in fact normal The crowds will disperse The wall of noise will dissolve But this legacy will remain a nation slowly being rewired to expect different to expect better

Here was a simple and unremarkable vision of what sport can be which also acted as a rueful and wistful vision of what sport could have been all these years had the games administrators and custodians valued women beyond their ability to bear children and serve tea

Drake has attempted to defend his use of a large private plane for a series of flights that lasted less than 20 minutes  by revealing that the aircraft was being moved to a storage location with no passengers on board

It comes after a Guardian report highlighted how many celebrities are taking short flights on private jets when cars and public transport are viable options

Over the past six weeks Drakes personal Boeing 767 has taken a sevenminute flight a 12minute flight and a 14minute flight all between Toronto and nearby Hamilton

The 14minute trip burned through 426 gallons of fuel and caused four tons of carbon emissions which is the same as the total annual carbon footprint of an average person according to Celebrity Jets an automated Twitter account that tracks the private flights of the rich and famous

Responding on Instagram to criticism of these flights Drake wrote This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics  nobody takes that flight

While several of Drakes fans responded with support arguing that celebrities often move their planes for convenience others pointed out the pollution from the flight was even more pointless given it didnt transport anybody

One reply to Drake stated OK but thats worse you dont see how thats worse

Private jets contribute in a relatively small but significant way to the climate crisis emitting more than 33m tonnes of greenhouse gases more than the country of Denmark each year

Because they carry so few people they are five to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes per passenger and 50 times more polluting than trains researchers have found

Drakes empty flights will have been even more carbon intensive given the lack of people on board

I made a promise to myself once I came out That if I ever found myself in a public role that I would be open and proud of who I am

He added that if I can help even one person out there that my life will have been worth it

Guardian columnist Owen Jones has written about why its important we acknowledge and respond to the fact that 98 of those infected with monkeypox by late June were men who have sex with men

The monkeypox outbreak was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization last week and countries in Europe have been hit the hardest

Most patients recover from monkeypox in a few weeks and an effective vaccine  developed for smallpox  is available in the UK

The WHO said the outbreak was largely among men who have sex with men who had reported having sex recently with new or multiple partners

That so many queer men are haunted by a recent traumatic history is understandable but the lesson of HIVAids is that those most at risk should be protected without stigma We have the means to squash this outbreak the greatest enemy is fear owenjones84 writes

He continues Stigma welded itself to the internalised shame that afflicts all too many queer men made throughout history to feel dirty and even sinful  As a result some fear any messaging that emphasises monkeypoxs disproportionate effect on men who have sex with men But the problem with the HIVAids response wasnt that it was targeted its that it was stigmatised

An anguished rendering of Canadas national anthem in Cree by an Indigenous woman with tears streaming down her face marked one of several emotional moments in the first leg of Pope Franciss apology tour in the country

The unscripted moment concluded a ceremony fraught with symbolism for thousands of residential school survivors who sat in sombre silence as Francis said how deeply sorry for the Catholic churchs role in Canadas abusive residential school system

For more than a century the residential school system forcibly separated more than 150000 Indigenous children from their families and subjected many to starvation beatings and sexual abuse in what Canadas Truth and Reconciliation Commission called cultural genocide

During the ceremony Francis lamented the colonising mentality behind the system and catastrophic effects it had on generations of Indigenous people I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the Indigenous peoples he said

This should be a moment of global epiphany

What did you first think when you saw these images

For some they look like they could be an oil painting but the reality is far from that The first photograph shows flames engulfing chairs and a dining table inside a burning home in Mariposa county California on Saturday

A ferocious wildfire in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada raged uncontained over the weekend forcing thousands of residents from their homes in the gateway to Yosemite national park

The Oak fire started on Friday near the town of Midpines California and has exploded in size It remained at 0 containment on Sunday night despite a heavily resourced firefighting effort having consumed more than 6000 hectares 15000 acres

Discussing the brutality and fastgrowing nature of the blaze the former vicepresident Al Gore long a campaigner for action on the climate crisis warned The survival of our civilization is at stake

Burning through dense and dry vegetation on the regions steep and rugged hillsides the blaze was fanned by gusty winds and temperatures that hovered around 100F 38C The extreme nature of the fire meant it turned tall trees into matchsticks and sent black smoke billowing over the quaint historic downtown of Mariposa

The fire is one of dozens burning across the American west as the region braces for peak firerisk months that still lie ahead More than 55m acres have already burned in the US this year roughly 70 more than the 10year average

Its estimated that her 17minute jaunt wouldve resulted in a ton of carbon dioxide emissions which while in itself not a huge amount is about a quarter of the total annual carbon footprint of the average person globally The trip would have taken Jenner about 40 minutes in a car causing just a fraction of the emissions

Im not surprised people are upset they are right to be mad at this said Jack Sweeney creator of the Celebrity Jets account which uses data from a company that tracks aircraft transponders

Emissions from private jets flown in the US have surged since the 1990s and will balloon further as larger and more polluting aircraft come onto the market

The frequent use of aviation is the domain of the worlds wealthy with just 1 of the global population responsible for half of the emissions associated with flying

These startlingly short flights show the immense impact of the wealthy in overall aviation emissions said Scott Hochberg an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversitys Climate Law Institute

The problem starts at the top with Kylie Jenner and other celebrities with private jets  But it also includes many others as the US constitutes the bulk of the wealthy elite that have the luxury of flying

So what do you think the future of private jets should be

This extreme heat is just the beginning says climate scientist Bill McGuire We should be scared  and channel this emotion into action

The UK has already recorded its hottest day ever and the Met Office says temperatures are likely to rise further throughout the day Forecasters say temperatures could reach 41C

The previous UK record was 387C recorded in Cambridge University Botanic Garden on 25 July 2019

Too many of us still think that global heating will just mean that the world will get a bit warmer and that somehow we will muddle through This is plain wrong So be scared but dont let this feed inertia Instead channel the emotion and use it to launch your contribution to tackling the climate emergency McGuire writes

As the UK braces today for the hottest temperatures on record the world faces a wave of extreme heat events that have led to deaths displacement and chaos since the start of July alone

From raging fires to glacier collapses recent scorching weather has caused a range of natural disasters that have wreaked havoc for millions

Abnormal and extreme events like these are likely to become far more normal say experts pointing out that these natural disasters are no natural occurrence  instead they are a dire consequence of a heating world caused or exacerbated by the climate crisis

A study published in May showed that the recent south Asian heatwave was made 30 times more likely to happen by human influence on the climate

Climate change is a real game changer when it comes to heatwaves they have increased in frequency intensity and duration across the world said Friederike Otto senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute Imperial College London

Human activity is adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere every year and only drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will prevent more climate chaos

We cannot adapt our way out of the climate crisis Katharine Hayhoe chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy told the Observer If we continue with businessasusual greenhouse gas emissions there is no adaptation that is possible You just cant

It was absolutely thrilling says Lesley Stevenson senior paintings conservator at the National Galleries of Scotland about the moment she discovered this previously unknown selfportrait of Vincent van Gogh

The artists already famous painting Head of a Peasant Woman was being Xrayed as part of a cataloguing exercise and in preparation for the Royal Scottish Academys summer exhibition of French impressionism

The Xray plates were processed in an oldfashioned darkroom and when Stevenson looked at the images she realised she was staring at the face of Van Gogh himself

Lo and behold We dont see much of the peasant woman but what we have is the lead white the much heavier pigment he used for his face showing up after the Xray goes through the cardboard

Now the conservators will try to separate the selfportrait from the original painting without damaging either work

Its like stepping into the unknown Stevenson said The challenge will be removing the adhesive from the oil paint layers exploiting the difference in solubility of animalbased glue and oilbased paint

They associated my behaviour as a child with words you would use to describe an adult  they saw me as calculating and disrespectful not just a young child struggling

Mumtaz Musa a 20yearold student whose ADHD went undiagnosed at school has spoken about feeling the pernicious and devastating impact of adultification from her teachers

The term adultification bias originated in the US in about 2008 but its usage has grown in the UK in recent months

Safeguarding expert Jahnine Davis says it can mean that children of colour are not seen as innocent as their white peers would be It is a form of racism that has a disproportionate impact on Black children

One example that caused widespread outrage and protest is the case of Child Q Metropolitan police officers performed a stripsearch on a 15yearold Black schoolgirl Child Q while at school after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis by her teacher in 2020 She was searched without another adult present and in the knowledge that she was menstruating Her parents were not contacted

A month after the story of Child Q broke this year adultification was blamed for another case This time an eightyearold Black boy was forced to clean his fiveyearold sister after she soiled herself at an afterschool club in north London The boy said he was forced to do it in front of other people despite toilet facilities being located nearby

A leaked trove of confidential files has revealed the inside story of how Uber flouted laws duped police exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion

The unprecedented leak to the Guardian of more than 124000 documents  known as the Uber files  lays bare the ethically questionable practices that fuelled the companys transformation into one of Silicon Valleys most famous exports

The leaked records cover 201317 when Uber was run by its cofounder Travis Kalanick who tried to force the cabhailing service into cities around the world even if that meant breaching laws and taxi regulations

During the fierce global backlash the data shows how Uber tried to shore up support by discreetly courting powerful figures such as Joe Biden Emmanuel Macron and George Osborne

Leaked messages suggest Uber executives were at the same time under no illusions about the companys lawbreaking with one joking they had become pirates and another conceding Were just fucking illegal

The cache of files includes more than 83000 emails iMessages and WhatsApp messages including often frank and unvarnished communications between Kalanick and his top team of executives

In one exchange Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry I think its worth it he shot back Violence guarantees success

In a statement Kalanicks spokesperson said he never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety and any suggestion he was involved in such activity would be completely false

The Guardian led a global investigation into the leaked Uber files sharing the data with media organisations around the world via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ

More than 180 journalists at 40 media outlets including Le Monde Washington Post and the BBC will in the coming days publish a series of investigative reports about the tech giant

These are the words Nawfat Ibshar 18 has chosen to write on a protest sign  referring to the next major climate summit in Egypt in November

Surrounded by youngsters displaying similar warnings  including one that reads up to my neck in the climate crisis  Ibshar stands halfsubmerged in water caused by catastrophic flash flooding that hit her home

As the climate crisis makes the yearly monsoons that batter her home more deadly and frustrated by the lack of global response Ibshar wants to ensure that the plight of her people is heard

We have a voice and I wanted us to use it she says

Over the past few weeks Bangladesh has been hit by some of the worst floods in a century particularly in northeastern Sylhet where rising waters have washed away entire towns killing at least 68 people and leaving thousands of people without their homes

One victim of the devastation is Rita Akhter 19 who was eight months pregnant with her first child when she woke up one night to find herself waistdeep in water

I was terrified for my unborn child and didnt think that we would make it she said recalling how in 10 minutes the water had reached her neck

With hundreds of thousands displaced and millions affected young volunteers such as Ibshar have been battling the impacts and fighting for change as the climate crisis threatens to worsen global and gender inequalities

These empowering images by photographer Daniel Jack Lyons explore the queerness and trans experience of marginalised communities in the heart of the Amazon

danieljacklyons started his project while working in Casa do Rio a youth centre in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil which celebrates and supports the cultural lives of teenagers and young people

As a member of the LGBTQ community himself Lyons was able to create a safe space for queer and trans youth who were torn between hope and disillusionment bound by tradition and heritage struggling to assert their difference within their community

He offered to take their portraits allowing them to choose the sessions location and their clothing and pose so that the work can be considered as a collaboration

For all the struggles that come with queerness there is also this magical aspect in that I have a builtin family and community wherever I go

I did not set out to only document Indigenous queer and trans people in the Amazon but it was the trans nonbinary and queer people that I developed the most intimate connections with There was also a very intense desire among the queer community to be seen

The former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has died aged 67 after being shot while making a speech in the western city of Nara

Abe the countrys longestserving prime minister until he resigned in 2020 was flown to hospital by helicopter after the attack

Footage and accounts broadcast by Japanese media showed Abes speech interrupted by two loud bangs  possibly from a shotgun  and smoke with Abe stumbling to the ground after the second shot

Moments later members of Abes security detail wrestled a man to the ground metres behind the former prime minister The suspect reportedly did not attempt to flee before being detained at the scene

TBS Television reported that he had been shot on the left side of his chest and apparently also in the neck NHK had initially quoted firefighters as saying Abe showed no vital signs

The conservative politician who had been in Nara to make a campaign speech ahead of this Sundays upper house elections was known for his Abenomics policy to lift the worlds thirdbiggest economy out of deflation and for supporting a more prominent role for Japans military to counter growing threats from North Korea and a more assertive China

Abe was also instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared as the Nintendo video game character Mario during the Olympic handover at Rio 2016

Japan has close to zerotolerance of gun ownership  an approach that experts say contributes to its extremely low rate of gun crime There were six reported gun deaths in 2014 according to the National Police Agency and the number rarely exceeds 10 in a country of 126 million people

Police said the weapon thought to have been used in the attack was homemade according to local media reports You can follow the latest developments  and read more about Abes life  via the link in bio

I can no longer pirouette around our fractured values We can and must be better than this

Thats what Victoria Atkins MP wrote in her letter of resignation from Boris Jonsons government She is among a growing list more than 27 Conservative ministers and aides who have so far left their posts in the past 24 hours as confidence in the prime minister disintegrates

I cannot square Mr Johnsons patronage with my personal sense of decency and honour said Andrew Murrison MP while Saqib Bhatti MP added that his conscience will not allow him to continue

At 6pm on Tuesday the UK prime minister gave an interview he hoped would stem some of the criticism over his handling of the Chris Pincher allegations but within two minutes Sajid Javid had resigned as health secretary Then Rishi Sunak quit as chancellor And the list has since been rapidly increasing

Many of the resignation letters name the prime ministers hiring of Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip as the final straw and accused the prime minister of lying Pincher is understood to have been accused of groping some individuals at a Conservative event in 2019 Johnson was briefed on this before hiring Pincher but denied knowing this information After proof surfaced that he was briefed Johnson said he simply forgot he had been told and apologised for hiring Pincher

Today marks Americas Independence Day but many people are calling for a boycott of the celebration of nationhood after the US supreme courts decision to overturn Roe v Wade ten days ago which had protected womens reproductive rights for nearly half a century and reverses a historic victory of the global womens movement

Now twentysix states are poised to ban or severely restrict abortion immediately which will make it illegal for millions of women across most of the south and midwest

The case of a 10yearold child rape victim in Ohio who was six weeks pregnant ineligible for an abortion in her own state and forced to travel to Indiana for the procedure has spotlighted the shocking impact of the US supreme court ruling on abortion

The story of the girl came to light three days after the court overturned a nationwide right to terminate pregnancy and Ohios sixweek trigger ban came into effect

The case has triggered widespread backlash and has placed prominent antiabortion political figures in the position of balancing the rights of women and girls  including abuse victims  while defending abortion restrictions

The victims of R Kelly spoke with emotion about the impact his crimes had had on them

At the trial several women testified in court against the US singer who was sentenced to  30 years in prison

They described how Kelly real name Robert Sylvester Kelly subjected them to perverse and sadistic sexual abuse when they were underage

In this video we hear from two of the victims Lizzette Martinez and Jovante Cunningham who say they are grateful for their abusers conviction and sentence

After passing sentence judge Ann Donnelly spoke directly to Kelly saying These crimes were calculated and carefully planned and regularly executed for almost 25 years You taught them that love is enslavement and violence

Kellys conviction represents a victory for survivors of sexual violence and attracted attention in light of the MeToo movement in which powerful men have been held to account for their exploitation and sexual assault of women and girls

Over 50 years Dr Jim Taggart created one of Scotlands most magical gardens on the Rosneath peninsula in Argyll and Bute

This portrait of him in his greenhouse was taken by photographer Robbie Lawrence not long before he died in 2019 aged 84

The renowned botanist and climate activist welcomed many visitors to his garden  where he and his late son Jamie collected around 4000 plant species from across the world including rare magnolias and acers 40 kinds of bamboo and 300 different rhododendrons

Taggarts portrait is now just one of a series of stunning images of rural Scotland that Lawrence has included in his first UK solo exhibition Northern Diary

It brings together a selection of work he has produced over the past seven years documenting his relationship with his homeland during a time of political upheaval

One of our darkest days

Outrage and disappointment swept the US after the supreme court decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion upending federal reproductive protections set nearly 50 years ago in the landmark Roe v Wade case

Prochoice democrats activists and celebrities have decried the opinion as a painful blow to rights for millions

Meanwhile Joe Biden denounced the opinion as so extreme emphasizing the widereaching effect it will have on reproductive health nationwide Now with Roe gone lets be very clear the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk said Biden

Biden said his administration will work to protect other means of accessing abortion in restrictive states including abortion pills by mail the ability to obtain outofstate abortions and other ways If any state or local official high or low tries to interfere with a womans exercise of her basic right to travel I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply unAmerican attack said Biden

Protests quickly erupted outside the supreme court after its conservative judges overturned Roe v Wade and ended the constitutional right to an abortion

Protesters young and old joined together to condemn the decision amid scenes of anger and sorrow

This has been a fight 30 years in the making to overturn women and peoples fundamental rights to make decisions about their body There is no coming back from this There is no response other than outrage and action said Sara Kugler of Washington DC who was standing outside the court building

This will not succeed Abortions are still going to happen God forgive them for they know not what they do another Washington area resident who asked to use her first name Cathy said

Theyre dividing our country even more They really are Theyre making it more complicated It could have settled it and stopped with this religious push And this religious push from presidents like Trump who are not even qualified to lead us  its horrible she added

Representative Maxine Waters a senior Democrat from California stopped to speak with the Guardian as she walked in front of the supreme court building

I dont care what that vote is today They can not stop us They cannot control our lives Were going to do everything that we can possibly do  were going to continue to organize she said

When asked what the prochoice side was planning to do in reaction to the courts decision she said Were going to turn out a huge vote of women Were going to see if we can get something on the ballot real soon Were going to do everything we can possibly do

The supreme court just overturned the landmark Roe v Wade case which granted women in the US the right to terminate a pregnancy 

A reversal of this magnitude is almost unprecedented particularly on a case decided nearly 50 years ago

Historically the court has overturned cases to grant more rights The court has done the opposite here and its decision will restrict a constitutional right generations of Americans have grown up taking for granted

The extraordinarily rare move will allow more than half of states to ban abortion with an immediate and enduring impact on tens of millions of Americans

To find out more swipe to read our QA on the ruling
Just in the supreme court has ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion in the United States upending a precedent set nearly 50 years ago in the landmark Roe v Wade case  a rare reversal of longsettled law that will fracture the foundations of modern reproductive rights in America

The courts ruling came in the pivotal case Dobbs v Jackson Womens Health Organization in which the last abortion clinic in Mississippi opposed the states efforts to ban abortion after 15 weeks and overturn Roe in the process

The reversal of the 1973 opinion will again allow individual US states to ban abortion At least 26 states are expected to do so immediately or as soon as practicable

The courts decision in Dobbs is certain to be one of the most consequential in generations It will have profound immediate and enduring consequences for the lives of tens of millions of American women and other people who can become pregnant and unpredictable ripple effects that could play out over decades

The final ruling from the conservativedominated court comes after a draft opinion was leaked in early May In it rightleaning associate justice Samuel Alito laid out a caustic argument for reversing Roe v Wade

Experts believe the coming days and weeks will bring chaotic attempts by conservatives to ban the procedure as soon as possible as a patchwork of some of the most severe abortion restrictions in the world go into effect

Large swaths of the US south and midwest are expected to ban abortion or impose severe restrictions forcing patients who want the procedure to potentially travel hundreds of miles or selfmanage abortions at home

At least one economist has estimated such bans could result in an additional 60000 births a year among women who want an abortion but are unable to obtain one Such bans are likely to affect 41 of women of reproductive age in the US and hit the young poor Black and brown women and people who already have children the hardest

Survivors in Afghanistan have been digging through rubble to find those still missing after a powerful earthquake hit the country killing more than 1000 people

The quake shook southeast Afghanistan in the early hours of Wednesday A combination of rugged terrain and heavy rain is hampering aid efforts

Rescue efforts have been further complicated by the fact that many countries suspended or cut back on aid to Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover last year

The Afghan people are already facing an unprecedented crisis following decades of conflict severe drought and an economic downturn said Gordon Craig from the World Food Programme

We all know how difficult it can be hard to overhaul our diets Old habits die hard and so do our appetites for certain foods

This is often why so many people struggle to become fully vegetarian or vegan overnight even if they want to do more for the environment

But what if there was another option

Certain plantbased diets can be the ideal but even partly shifting your diet away from meat and dairy products can still have a significant impact when it comes to reducing harmful emissions

Its important to note though that its not all about personal responsibility  Many experts argue that the food industry needs to adapt to the climate crisis and start offering us more ecofriendly choices that dont swap sustainability for taste

Its hard for people to change their diets says Caroline Bushnell at the Good Food Institute a nonprofit that advocates for plantbased and cultured meat Its like offering someone the choice between fries and a side salad she says Most people dont pick the side salad  its not really an equivalent option

Thats what Trudy Hale now 73 years old remembers about her abortion at the age of 18 in 1967  a time preRoe v Wade

The landmark US supreme court decision which has given Americans abortion rights since 22 January 1973 was set to turn 50 next year

But as the supreme court approaches summer recess it looks likely that critical precedent will soon be overturned and never reach its milestone birthday

With the regulation of abortion returned to individual states a large swath of the midwest and south  about 20 states housing half of the countrys population  will no longer have access to legal abortion

This is set to see a return to abortion experiences that have many similarities to preRoe v Wade America Pre1973 those with the necessary means travelled across state lines to get the procedures they needed Today like back then campaigners fear that poor Black Latina teenage women and undocumented immigrants will be disproportionately affected

What is different today is that some women will be able to access abortion pills over the internet and selfmanage the procedure

We spoke to five women from across the US about their experiences of abortion in the preRoe v Wade era Some were nervous others defiant But all shared their story in the hope that their past could shape Americas future

We are writing history right now  a new history for Colombia for Latin America and for the world gustavopetrourrego said

Petros election marks a tidal shift for Colombia a country that has never before had a leftist president and follows similar victories for the left in Peru Chile and Honduras

During his victory speech Petro issued a call for unity and extended an olive branch to some of his harshest critics saying all members of the opposition will be welcomed at the presidential palace to discuss the problems of Colombia

From this government that is beginning there will never be political persecution or legal persecution there will only be respect and dialogue he said adding that he will listen to not only those who have raised arms but also to that silent majority of peasants Indigenous people women youth

He added This is no longer time for resentment This government that will begin on 7 August is a government of life is a government that wants to build Colombia as a world life power And if we summarise in three words what the government of life means I would say first peace second social justice and third environmental justice

Petros vicepresident will be Francia Mrquez  a prizewinning defender of human and environmental rights  marking the first time that a black woman fills the post

Struggling to sleep in the current temperatures

Heatwaves around the world  including earlier this year when India and Pakistan reached heights of nearly 50C 122F  have been made more frequent and hotter because of the humanmade climate emergency

And as temperatures soar the amount of sleep we get a night is dropping says researchers  with dangerous consequences

A recent study published in May in the journal One Earth in May revealed that the average global citizen is already losing 44 hours of sleep a year leading to 11 nights with fewer than seven hours sleep a standard benchmark of sufficient sleep Researchers believe this could be the tip of the iceberg

Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira have been killed in an undeclared global war against nature and the people who defend it

The Guardians global environment editor Jonathan Watts has paid tribute to his friend the journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira after the gruelling 10day search for the pair in the Amazon came to an end on Wednesday

Their deaths have horrified Brazil and underlined the growing dangers faced by those defending the countrys environment and Indigenous communities

Watch as Watts shares an insight into their lives their work and their legacy
New data has revealed extraordinary rates of global heating in the Arctic up to seven times faster than the global average

The heating is occurring in the North Barents Sea a region where fast rising temperatures are suspected to trigger increases in extreme weather in North America Europe and Asia

Recent years have seen temperatures far above average recorded in the Arctic with seasoned observers describing the situation as crazy weird and simply shocking Some climate scientists have warned the unprecedented events could signal faster and more abrupt climate breakdown

Sea ice is good at reflecting sunlight but is melting away This allows the darker ocean below to absorb more energy Losing sea ice also means it no longer restricts the ability of warmer sea waters to heat up the Arctic air The more ice is lost the more heat accumulates forming a feedback loop

It was already known that the climate crisis was driving heating across the Arctic three times faster than the global average but the new research shows the situation is even more extreme in places

The figures show annual average temperatures in the area are rising across the year by up to 27C a decade with particularly high rises in the months of autumn of up to 4C a decade This makes the North Barents Sea and its islands the fastest warming place known on Earth

The researchers said the heating in this region was an early warning of what could happen across the rest of the Arctic

The worlds scientists said in April that immediate and deep cuts to carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases are needed to tackle the climate emergency

Now we can bring them home and say goodbye with love
 
Police in the Brazilian Amazon have found the bodies of two men in the area close to where British journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira went missing 10 days ago
 
The announcement brought a sad end to a long search which has horrified the nation and underlined the growing dangers faced by those who dare to defend Brazils environment and Indigenous communities whose rights have been increasingly under attack under the countrys farright president Jair Bolsonaro
 
Phillips and Pereira set off into the forest on 2 June for what was supposed to be a short trip But by Sunday 5 June they had not returned
 
It was supposed to be one of Phillipss last trips to the Amazon the kicker for a book that would reveal all the lush complexity of the worlds largest rainforest Instead it seems to have been a final chapter for Phillips who was a frequent contributor to the Guardian and his friend Pereira a guide and expert on Indigenous people
 
Phillips a 57yearold journalist from Merseyside in the UK and Pereira a 41yearold father of two from Brazils northeast bonded over a shared love of the Amazon
 
For almost two years they travelled together with Pereira accompanying Phillips on his reporting trips Phillips was writing a book about sustainable development in the rainforest and the younger man was an eager companion
 
Pereira believed in the project and opened doors to the jungle and its people
 
In a statement Phillipss wife Alessandra Sampaio said Although we are still awaiting definitive confirmations this tragic outcome puts an end to the anguish of not knowing Dom and Brunos whereabouts Now we can bring them home and say goodbye with love  Today we also begin our quest for justice
 
You can read beautifully written tributes to the two men about how they were brought together by their love of the Amazon and a desire to tell the stories of the Indigenous peoples who live there via the link in our bio

Raging flood waters have pulled houses into rivers and swept away roads and bridges in and around Yellowstone national park

The flooding across parts of southern Montana and northern Wyoming forced the closure of Yellowstone just as a summer tourist season was ramping up

Flooding and slides were triggered by days of torrential showers in the park and steady rains across much of the wider region after one of its wettest springs in many years The park service characterised the levels of rainfall and flooding sweeping the park as unprecedented

A sudden rise in summer temperatures also hastened melting and runoff of snow

Just north of the park hundreds of people remained isolated after the Yellowstone River and its tributaries washed away the only roadways

Photographer Dmitry Kokh travelled to Lake Baikal in Siberia  the worlds deepest and oldest freshwater lake  determined to capture the magical world below the ice

He says taking pictures of Baikal seals  known locally as nerpa  in their natural environment is something few people have done

Newborn pups are covered with white fur are unable to swim and it is impossible to get close without scaring them

But within a few weeks their fur becomes thicker and grey and the pup is ready to explore the depths of the lake and the magical world below the ice

Finding a burrow in the vast expanse of the Baikal ice is no easy job but after a few fruitless dives they struck gold  with the professional help of Pulka a local dog seen on slide eight with years of experience in the job

Sudoku aromatherapy and a haircut are among the suggestions being offered to vulnerable people in the UK who have been threatened with deportation to Rwanda to help them feel better the Guardian has learned

One man who is in his 40s and of east African descent has been detained at an immigration removal centre since arriving in the UK via boat in May He has been served a notice for removal to Rwanda by the Home Office

He has been recognised as being a survivor of torture and at risk of selfharm or suicide due to his current and past trauma He is also suspected to have been a survivor of modernday slavery and human trafficking

He was not offered counselling Instead he received a handout with suggestions on how to feel better

The letter from Central and North West London NHS foundation trust and dated 30 May stated You have been referred to the Psychology Wellbeing Service for support for the trauma that you have experienced in the past Unfortunately at present we are unable to provide onetoone psychology sessions due to unforeseen circumstances

It explained that a trauma handout pack would be provided offering information about trauma techniques and strategies to support yourself while in immigration detention

Speaking of his experience and the prospect of being sent to Rwanda the man said I am unable to think clearly because of the prospect of being sent to a country that is comparable or worse from that I undertook a traumatising and long journey to escape

A Home Office spokesperson said The health and welfare of those in immigration detention is of the utmost importance to us

All immigration removal centres have dedicated health facilities run by doctors and nurses who provide mental health support to NHS England standards while onsite welfare teams work to identify vulnerable individuals and provide support where necessary including taking every step to prevent selfharm or suicide

Summer festivalgoers are being warned that an unprecedented shift in the drug market caused by a combination of Brexit Covid lockdowns and police operations against supply chains has led to a sharp and potentially harmful increase in fake MDMA

Criminologists and chemists have found that 45 of substances sold as MDMA ecstasy at festivals in England last year did not contain any of the drug 

By comparison in 2019  when the research was carried out at the same festivals  only 7 of the pills tested did not contain MDMA

In the first peerreviewed scientific study of the trend experts say many pills bought by partygoers as MDMA were made up of ingredients such as cathinones a new psychoactive substance NPS and caffeine 

Some users reported illeffects such as panic psychosis and prolonged insomnia

The main plank of the research is fieldwork carried out by the drugchecking charity theloopuk whose researchers visited three English music festivals in summer 2021 and tested hundreds of pills that buyers had believed were MDMA in a mobile laboratory

The scientists warn that with the impact of Brexit still being keenly felt on legal and illegal markets suppliers may continue to flood festivals and other events with fake MDMA posing risks to users

An Iranian asylum seeker has spoken to the Guardian after finding out that they were to be among the first in a group of 130 people expected to be flown one way from the UK to Rwanda  and then encouraged to apply for asylum there

The home secretary Priti Patel announced last week that the first deportation flight to the east African country would leave on 14 June a plan politicians have described as evil and inhumane

Those facing removal have had their asylum claims deemed inadmissible by the Home Office because of how they reached the UK  generally crossing the Channel in a dinghy However according to the Refugee Council anyone has the legal right to apply for asylum in the UK under international law no matter how they entered it

Those currently detained for offshoring include Syrian Sudanese Afghan Eritrean Iranian and Iraqi asylum seekers some of whose home countries are active conflict zones

A Home Office spokesperson said Our worldleading partnership with Rwanda is a key part of our strategy to overhaul the broken asylum system and break the evil peoplesmugglers business model

It was confirmed today that Patels plan is facing its first legal challenge under emergency proceedings launched in the high court

What foods do you need to stay healthy at every stage of your life And are you eating enough of them 

Nutrition is one of the hardest sciences to do well says Graham Lawton a science writer whose first book This Book Could Save Your Life aimed to debunk a number of contemporary health fads

And while it is difficult to generalise Lawton says there is some consensus over the sorts of food we might want to prioritise at various life stages

We spoke to him  along with nutrition experts Dr Rachel Ward who is a GP in Oxfordshire and Sophie Medlin London chair of the British Dietetic Association  to find out the ideal ingredients for healthy eating throughout our lives

Swipe to find out what they said

As for all ages this is what they recommended

 Unsurprisingly avoid ultraprocessed foods which are high in sugar salt and artificial trans fats a type of fat so closely linked to heart disease that theyve been banned in Denmark Switzerland Austria and some US states
 Load up on fruit and vegetables  and remember to eat a variety
 Omega3 found in foods like white fleshed and oily fish can keep your heart healthy
 Calcium is not only good for growing children but for adults 30 to ensure bone health

For everything else
Its about moderate doses says Lawton

At about midnight on 1 March 2022 a Russian air force jet dropped a series of 250kg Sovietera explosives over Borodyanka north of Kyiv

They were powerful FAB250 bombs designed to hit military targets such as enemy fortifications and bunkers There were no such structures however in this quiet town of 13000 people

The bombs fell on at least five residential buildings splitting them in two Dozens of bodies were found under the rubble when the Russians withdrew from the Kyiv region in early April leaving in their path a gigantic crime scene Ukrainian prosecutors are now investigating alleged war crimes by Russia and its president Vladimir Putin who began his war 100 days ago today

A war crime is a violation of the laws of war a component of international law established by the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 and further defined by the Geneva conventions of 1949 including the intentional killing of prisoners of war and civilians torture and the use of illegal weapons

Known as that sand girl on TikTok 24yearold Franziska Trautmann is trying to help restore eroding coastlines in America  with glass sand

The idea started as many good ones do  while drinking a bottle of wine with her cofounder Max Steitz in college The pair realised the bottle would end up in a landfill so decided to take action and launch Glass Half Full the only glass recycling facility in Louisiana

The state loses about an American football fields worth of land every 100 minutes due to rising sea levels heavy storms which wash the land away and salt water intrusion where sea water infiltrates fresh water wetlands and kills the native plant life

And this is a truly global issue The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that If the world continued to emit carbon at the rate it was in 2020 sea levels will rise by an estimated 80cm by 2100 If this happens 13 of the planets icefree coastline will go under water

Whats more  is that sand is the most exploited resource in the world after water but its use is largely ungoverned meaning we are consuming it faster than it can be naturally replaced

So far glasshalffullnola has diverted more than 22m lbs of glass from landfills and the team is working with scientists to expand its work to other parts of the world experiencing coastal erosion

And we know what youre thinking  no  the sand wont cut you

Our community will always remember the 72 who died needlessly

As people up and down the UK prepare for street parties to mark the Queens jubilee campaigners held a special event to remember those killed by the fire at the Grenfell Tower in London five years ago

Their jubilee street party was held at the foot of the building but there were 72 empty seats  a place setting was laid for each person who died after the fire broke out in the 24storey tower block in north Kensington

Emma Louise OConnor who escaped from the 20th floor of the tower when it was alight told the BBC The Jubilee celebrations being so close to the fiveyear anniversary its kind of hard to be able to get involved with celebrating

Nabil Choucair who lost six family members in the fire said I miss my family so much we enjoyed many good times together but they were taken from us in the worst of circumstances I can almost picture them seated at the table today joining in the celebration But they are not with us today The pain is indescribable but they are always with us in our hearts

A government review into building regulations after the fire concluded that indifference and ignorance led to a race to the bottom in building safety practices with cost prioritised over safety

In 2019 the then chairman of the Grenfell inquiry panel Sir Martin MooreBick concluded that the principal reason the fire spread at such pace was down to combustible cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a source of fuel

Justice4Grenfell organiser Yvette Williams said Five years on a toothless public inquiry and millions still trapped in their homes by flammable cladding  and still no justice There have been no lessons learned and little action taken

As people up and down the country enjoy street parties as they quite rightly should we want to let the powers that be know that our community will always remember the 72 who died needlessly here that night

From 19501981 every single piece of immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and work in the UK

This is the main conclusion of a 52page historical analysis commissioned and later suppressed by the UK Home Office

The leaked report by an unnamed historian which has been seen by the Guardian describes how the British Empire depended on racist ideology in order to function and sets out how this affected the laws passed in the postwar period

It finds that the scandal was caused by a failure to recognise that changes to British immigration law over the past 70 years had a more negative impact on black people than on other racial and ethnic groups

The report was commissioned by the Home Office as part of a commitment to educating civil servants about the causes of the Windrush scandal which saw thousands of people wrongly classified as illegal immigrants by the department

Named The Historical Roots of the Windrush Scandal the report focuses on the immigration legislation of the 20th century rather than on more recent events such as the effects of the hostile environment policies introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary

A Home Office spokesperson said the department would not name the historian who wrote the history adding that the Home Office was making progress towards becoming a more compassionate and open organisation

You must be the generation that succeeds in addressing the planetary emergency of climate change

The United Nations secretary general Antnio Guterres has told new university graduates not to take up careers with the companies that drive the extraction of fossil fuels  climate wreckers

Addressing thousands of graduates at Seton Hall University in New Jersey US on Tuesday he said Despite mountains of evidence of looming climate catastrophe we still see mountains of funding for coal and fossil fuels that are killing our planet  we must put them on notice accountability is coming for those who liquidate our future

The UN boss added You hold the cards Your talent is in demand from multinational companies and big financial institutions You will have plenty of opportunities to choose from My message to you is simple dont work for climate wreckers Use your talents to drive us towards a renewable future

Guterres has become increasingly outspoken on the climate crisis in recent months telling world leaders in April Our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us He has also recently attacked companies and governments whose climate actions do not match their words

The Guardian recently revealed that the 12 largest oil and gas companies were planning to spend 103m a day to 2030 on projects that cannot go ahead if global temperature rise is to be kept well below 2C as agreed by the worlds governments

Parents of schoolchildren from Robb elementary school in Uvalde a mostly Latino community near the Mexico border had to wait for hours in a parking lot to receive the news that their children were dead after being swabbed for DNA according to reports

David Hogg a survivor of the Parkland 2018 school shooting in Florida tweeted No parent should drop their kid off at school and then need a DNA test to ID which child is their child because they have been blown to pieces by an AR 15

The impact of the shooting has been compounded by its timing just 10 days after another 18yearold gunman opened fire on largely Black grocery shoppers in a supermarket in Buffalo New York killing 10 people

It has prompted passionate calls for tougher gun controls led by the US president Joe Biden matched by equally stringent demands for more armed guards in schools from the powerful gun lobby and Republicans

As a nation we have to ask When in Gods name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby a visibly shaken Biden said When in Gods name are we going to do what has to be done Why are we willing to live with this carnage He was sick and tired of it he said adding We have to act

But Republican leaders  not least in Texas itself  were just as robust in their calls for more guns in schools as a response to the shooting Ted Cruz the US senator from Texas said just a few hours after the school attack that the best way to keep kids safe was to have armed law enforcement officers present on campus

Its pathetic Ive had enough

Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr refused to talk about basketball before his teams game on Tuesday night instead delivering a passionate speech condemning gun violence in the United States

His team were playing against the Dallas Mavericks in Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference final in Texas where earlier in the day at least 21 people including 19 children had been killed in a school shooting

In the last 10 days weve had elderly Black people killed in a supermarket in Buffalo weve had Asian churchgoers killed in Southern California and now we have children murdered at school When are we going to do something Kerr shouted at his pregame press conference

Im tired I am so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out there I am so tired of the excuse me I am sorry I am tired of the moments of silence Enough

Kerr is a longtime advocate of gun control His father was shot dead in a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 He has repeatedly backed a bill that would require tighter background checks on people buying firearms The bill passed the US House of Representatives in 2021 but did not get to the Senate

The NBA coach looked into the camera before addressing the Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell saying I ask you Mitch McConnell I ask all of you senators who refuse to do anything about the violence and school shootings and supermarket shootings

I ask you Are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children and our elderly and our churchgoers Because thats what it looks like Its what we do every week

The sweetest little boy that Ive ever known

Thats how eightyearold Uziyah Garcias grandfather described his grandson He was one of at least 19 children and two adults killed by a teenage gunman who stormed into an elementary school in Texas  the latest bout of gunfueled mass killings in the US and the nations worst school shooting since Sandy Hook attack a decade ago

The massacre took place at Robb elementary school in Uvalde a heavily Latino community west of San Antonio near the Mexico border The school serves about 570 children nearly 90 of them Latino

Lisa Garza 54 of Arlington Texas has also mourned the death of her cousin Xavier Javier Lopez He was just a loving 10yearold little boy just enjoying life not knowing that this tragedy was going to happen she said

Amerie Jo Garza aged 10 as well was identified by family as one of the children killed Her father Angel Garza told ABC News she had just turned 10 on 10 May adding My little love is now flying high with the angels above Please dont take a second for granted Hug your family Tell them you love them I love you Amerie Jo Watch over your baby brother for me

One adult has been confirmed as fourthgrade teacher Eva Mireles Im furious that these shootings continue her aunt said in a statement These children are innocent Rifles should not be easily available to all

The massacre was the 27th school shooting this year in the US according to Education Week And it came a little more than a week after 10 people were killed in a supermarket in a predominantly Black area of Buffalo New York which is being investigated as a racially motivated hate crime and a gunman attacked a Taiwanese Presbyterian church in California killing one and injuring five

How many children have to die before politicians stop caring as much about their political careers as they do about their constituents and the lives of the children These shootings are everywhere Nicole Hockley whose son died in the Sandy Hook attack wrote in USA Today

Understandably after two years of the coronavirus pandemic any mention of a new viral outbreak is going to be quite alarming

So its no surprise that when countries across Europe and North America started detecting cases of monkeypox a disease usually found in central and western Africa there was a bit of a panic

So far over 100 confirmed cases have been identified in at least 12 countries It feels eerily similar to reports of a mystery disease found in Wuhan in 2019  but is it

Did you know the fortunes of the richest 20 billionaires are greater than the entire GDP of subSaharan Africa

And that a total of 573 new billionaires have emerged during the pandemic

Oxfam has said that the coronavirus crisis has been the best time in recorded history for the billionaire class

As the worlds business and political elite meet for the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland the development charity has published a new report revealing that the fortunes of food and energy billionaires have grown by 453bn over the past two years owing to soaring energy and commodity prices during the pandemic and Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine

Oxfam has found that spiralling global food prices had helped create 62 new food billionaires in just 24 months

Cargill which is one of the worlds largest food traders now counts 12 family members as billionaires up from eight before the pandemic The Cargill family along with three other companies controls 70 of the global agricultural market

Meanwhile Nellie Kumambala a primary schoolteacher who lives in Lumbadzi Malawi with her husband two children and her mother says Prices have risen so much even since last month Two litres of cooking oil last month was 2600 kwacha now it is 7500 Imagine Yesterday I went to the shop to buy cooking oil but I failed I did not have the money

Been tempted to buy clothes from a sponsored ad while scrolling Gone on a fashion retail website to buy something then ended up buying 10 because of a flash sale Youre not alone

Fashion especially the cheap kind is addictive says journalist and ethical fashion advocate zainabslowfashion

Now brands like Shein  which recently overtook Amazon as the most downloaded shopping app in the US last year  are speeding up the pace of fast fashion with lowerquality cheaper clothing this new type of ultrafast fashion is making the cycle of buy wear throw away and repeat all the more difficult to escape

Ultrafast fashion is fast fashion but with faster production faster trend cycles and faster disposal says Mahmood

And these shopping habits arent without consequences

This dominant model of fashion is untenable says Dilys Williams director of sustfash While acknowledging that the biggest customer base for this industry are people with substantial disposable income rather than those on low income she calls these clothes environmentally and socially destructive

In response to claims last year that its fashion business is unethical and unsustainable a spokesperson for Shein said the company is one of the only large retailers that orders 100 pieces or less for new products to help eliminate dead stock  which makes up 10 of the carbon emissions across the entire supply chain for the apparel industry Shein is fully committed to upholding high labor standards across the entire supply chain and to improving the lives of workers in the global supply chain by supporting national and international efforts to end forced labor

Mahmood argues that while Gen Z consumers are not to blame for ultrafast fashion where possible they should hold brands accountable for their harmful practices

So how exactly are these companies getting us hooked And what can we do about it

Since 2011 white replacement theory has been the explicit motivation for over 160 murders around the world

Last week a white man armed with a rifle entered a supermarket in Buffalo New York and killed 10 people almost all of whom were Black

He is suspected of having posted a 180page racist diatribe online He repeatedly referenced the racist false and extremist conspiracy theory known as the great replacement or white replacement The first listed goal in his document was kill as many blacks as possible

So what exactly is this theory  and how has it spread

Tymofiy Seidov has not seen another child since 30 April when most of this basement  in a building near the city of Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine  was evacuated

The eightyearold spends much of his time drawing at a little table dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark 40byfivemetre basement that he shares with 23 adults including his mum aunt and grandmother

Tanks feature a lot in his pictures But today in the gloom he is working on some Daleklike monsters that he says he remembers from a cartoon he watched on YouTube before the war He also draws happier scenes sometimes of houses under the sun and rainbows in the sky

I just think about surviving says Tymofiys mum Rita pictured on slide six

The family have been living here below the ruins of a twostorey kindergarten and medical centre in Kutuzivk since the war in Ukraine began on 24 February

Before the war the village had a population of 1500 After Russian troops invaded the village the population dropped to 50 Even when Ukrainian soldiers took Kutuzivk back some in the village had nowhere to go but underground  including Tymofiy and his family

On the first slide of this gallery Tymofiy and his aunt Yana Sotnikova mark off the days on a calendar to remember how long they have been down in the basement The exhausted and tearful people living there know the Russians can just as quickly return to Kutuzivka  or at least the artillery can

The world of sport has united to offer praise and support to Jake Daniels after the 17yearold ended decades of silence within mens football to become the first player in the UK to come out as gay since Justin Fashanu in 1990

Daniels said he has been aware of his sexuality since he was six years old but kept it secret as he pursued his dream of a career in football

But the teenager who made his senior debut for blackpoolfc only this month says he is now ready to act as a role model for others in the game after deciding the time is right to be myself be free and be confident in his identity

For a long time Ive thought I would have to hide my truth because I wanted to be and now I am a professional footballer officialjakedaniels said 

However I knew that would lead to a long time of lying and not being able to be myself or lead the life that I want to Since Ive come out to my family my club and my teammates that period of overthinking everything and the stress it created has gone

Danielss revelation is a striking landmark that comes when mens football is more engaged with social issues than in any recent time but still unable to cite progress in LGBTQ representation within the game

Last year Adelaide Uniteds joshuacavallo became the only male topflight professional footballer in the world to come out as gay but others are yet to follow 

In English football specifically the shadow of the talented and unfulfilled Fashanu still lingers over the game The England international came out at the end of his career and was to take his own life eight years later in 1998

Amal Fashanu Justins niece who runs a charitable foundation in his name said that Danielss decision would come as a huge comfort to the many footballers at all levels of the game still secretly living as gay and who still feel unable to come out

If my Uncle Justin were alive I know he would have been one of the first people to have contacted Jake to offer his support and best wishes she said Justins wish was to create a society where people could simply be kinder to one another and where bigotry doesnt exist

This is the invisible Ukrainian who  with his dog  walked 225km to safety from the hellscape of besieged Mariupol

When Russian soldiers started going from house to house shooting people Igor Pedin escaped by foot with a small trolley of supplies and his nineyearold mongrel terrier Zhu Zhu

The aim was to be the invisible man says Pedin 61 It was to drift as if a ghost out into the badlands of Russianoccupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainianheld city of Zaporizhzhia  a mere 225km walk away

For Pedin walking the equivalent distance from London to Sheffield through the biggest war in Europe since 1945 meant sidestepping mines avoiding nervous triggerhappy Russian soldiers racing towards Mariupol and passing by smouldering homes and weeping civilians with heartbreaking stories of death and suffering

The world is burning  but countries continue to invest in major fossil fuel projects a Guardian investigation has found 

Rather than reducing emissions companies around the world have committed to oil and gas projects which will produce devastating amounts of CO2 and stay within the goal of 15C

These projects are known as carbon bombs

As a result temperatures will rise which increases the risk of extreme heatwaves droughts and floods that are already affecting people worldwide 

But there is still time to turn this around says Damian Carrington the Guardians environment editor who worked on the investigation Its not quite too late but we have a very very very small window of time to act

Its not technicalities or the legal side that are stopping this from changing Its the political will Thats the good news in a way we know what the solution is But that is as far as the good news goes

The bills of death

Those are the words written on a poster Krig Si Kaingang from the Kaingang people in the state of Paran carried as she protested against a series of environmental bills in Brazil which have been condemned by activists as a historic assault on the planet

More than 200 different Indigenous ethnic groups gathered in the countrys capital of Braslia between 414 April to demonstrate against what they say is the antiIndigenous and antienvironment agenda of Brazils president Jair Bolsonaro

Activists fear these bills which include greenlighting mining and other commercial activities on Indigenous lands will exacerbate the already increasing destruction of the Amazon rainforest and hinder many Indigenous peoples from claiming their right to traditional lands

The protests were part of the annual Free Land Camp also known as Acampamento Terra Livre ATL which unites Brazils Indigenous groups in the ongoing fight to save their culture territories and biodiversity

Since Bolsonaro took office in 2019 vast stretches of the rainforest have been destroyed and traditional communities threatened

At least 18 people were murdered in land conflicts in 2020

Aged 39 Debi was surprised when she started experiencing menopausal symptoms hot flushes night sweats brain fog  and worst of all depression

I had to downgrade my entire life as I had no money no motivation and no interest in being any different she says

After six years of suffering Debi was prescribed hormone replacement therapy HRT a medication used to alleviate symptoms caused by the menopause Debi says that starting HRT was lifesaving because it stopped all of her physical symptoms and is improving her mental health

Menopause medication is growing in popularity with the number of prescriptions doubling in England over the past five years In 2022 about 1 million women in the UK are using HRT to treat symptoms

But now Britain is experiencing an acute shortage of HRT with shortfalls being blamed on manufacturing and supply issues

The Guardian revealed last month that shortages have been so severe that some women have been forced to travel hundreds of miles in search of HRT products Debi who experienced an HRT shortage in 2020 says she doesnt blame women for swapping their prescriptions

The oil giant Shell has reported a record quarterly profit of 91bn 73bn for the first three months of 2022

Thats almost three times the 32bn it made in the same quarter a year earlier and 43 higher than in the last quarter of 2021  and even more than analysts had forecast

Now the British government is facing growing pressure to implement a windfall tax on companies benefiting from soaring oil and gas prices  which could in turn be used on initiatives to reduce the burden of rising energy bills and the cost of living crisis

In the UK living standards are set to fall at their fastest rate since records began in the mid1950s with real household incomes falling by 22 this year and energy and food prices increasing

I literally have to choose between food and heat and hot water Ive not felt so desperate in my lifetime says Charlotte Littlefield 47 a motheroffour who relies on food banks

So what is a windfall tax

Governments typically use these oneoff levies as a tax on companies receiving outsized profits as a result of factors beyond their control like high energy prices

Companies that get oil and gas from the Earth are now getting much more money than they were last year because the demand has increased partly as society emerges from the pandemic but also due to supply concerns following Russias invasion of Ukraine

An abomination disgraceful and shocking

Thats how campaigners have described the truly seismic news that has broken in the US overnight the leak of a draft majority opinion which appears to show that the supreme court has privately voted to overturn half a century of protection for abortion rights

The leak to the Politico website was immediately the subject of intense textual and legal analysis by US journalists and experts trying to corroborate its authenticity It would be the worst security breach in the courts history

But while caution is obviously the right approach on such a momentous issue there was every sign  from the documents formatting and footnotes to the distinctive tone of conservative author Justice Samuel Alito  that it is legitimate There was no comment from the supreme court itself

The court could still vote the other way But if the end of Roe v Wade the 1973 ruling which enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion does happen it would be news of generational significance for American women and a huge blow for supporters of reproductive rights around the world

We didnt want to tell another story of poverty says the founder of chessinslums  tundeonakoya We wanted to tell a new story of the children that live in Makoko not because of their background but because of the potential that they wield

What do you think of when you think of chess

For Nigerian chess master Tunde Onakoya the game is a great equaliser He has set up a charity called Chess in Slums Africa to empower young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Lagos  and to change perceptions

Addressing the youthhubafrica DARE conference in Abuja last September Onakoya explained he had started teaching chess to kids in the Makoko slum in Lagos along with providing arithmetic lessons and scholarship opportunities to give them the required education and skills that they need to create the future that they desire for themselves

Widespread poverty has meant education is often not a priority for children in Makoko  an issue that has only been made worse by economic hardship caused by Covid rising food prices and a lack of government support

But the programme which started last February has taught over 200 children and transformed the lives of many students In March chess master and president of the mitpics chess club Tyrone Davis III visited the project and offered to sponsor 13yearold chess prodigy Benjamins education until university

Chess in Slums Africa has now worked across Lagos including teaching chess to homeless children living in the notoriously crimeridden Oshodi underpass and aims to train over 1 million children in the space of five years

The constitutional court in Italy has ruled that children in the country should be given the surnames of both parents

The ruling overturns the tradition of automatically naming all newborns after their fathers a practice the court said was discriminatory and harmful to the identity of the child

Children should be given both parents surnames in the order they decide unless they agree their children should take just one of them the court added in a statement

Any new legislation needs to be approved by parliament to implement the decision but the family minister Elena Bonetti said on Facebook that the government would fully support parliament in this process adding that parents should take equal responsibility for the upbringing of a child

Pope Francis and Italys political leaders have expressed concerns about the impact of a declining birth rate on the country with the cost of raising children seen as one of the factors

Because hes black they just assumed lets pick him and put him in a deportation centre

A mother has described how her 17yearold black British son was found at an immigration detention centre after going missing while being treated for psychosis

The boy  who is nonverbal  disappeared from a hospital in Kent where he had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act on 7 April

Two days later he was arrested by British Transport Police BTP at London Euston station on suspicion of fare evasion before being detained by Immigration Enforcement despite being a British citizen who has never left the UK

When the boy was returned to hospital his clothes contained Home Office documents that incorrectly stated his name and date of birth and recorded his nationality as Nigerian On one document seen by the Guardian it states his removal from the UK was imminent as hed failed to give satisfactory or reliable answers

According to the BTP officers were unable to engage with the male or verify the details provided despite their efforts They added that the male provided a false name and date of birth stating he was 20

This week a BTP commander told the boys mother that when they searched the Kent address the boy had provided they discovered a Nigerian family living there She was told that officers gathered the boy was from a Nigerian background as he had the same accent as the residents She contested this statement describing her sons accent when he does rarely speak as Mancunian and London

This incident has sparked fierce criticism on social media with ayocaesar a contributing editor at Novara Media tweeting that the details of this story are absolutely harrowing

A Home Office spokesperson said We rely on information provided by our policing partners when an individual is referred to Immigration Enforcement In this case the individual declared himself to BTP to be an adult male Police nurses assessed him and raised no physical or mental health issues They added once his true identity had been established he was returned into the care of mental health services

BTP said they were reviewing the incident internally

I just put my head on the table and said Im trans

This was how aged 45 Anya came out to her wife when she says she was at breaking point

For most of her life Anya kept her gender identity a secret which she believes is the result of attending conversion therapy  a practice that attempts to suppress or change a persons sexual orientation or gender identity

Every weekend from the age of 14 to 17 she was forced to go to conversion therapy under the supervision of her mother and the local priest  who hoped to make her more boylike  instead she says it destroyed her confidence

I wasnt brave enough to be myself Instead I played a part I played a lie

Only in 2020 when her wife sat her down over concerns over her mental health did she open up

Both sexuality and gender conversion therapy are legal and happening right now in the UK  and in many other countries around the world

In 2018 the UK government promised to ban all forms of LGBT conversion therapy But earlier this month Boris Johnson announced the ban will only apply to sexuality conversion therapy and not gender

This Uturn has prompted a backlash from some experts who warn of the damage that these practices have on the trans community

Anya says We should have exactly the same rights as everybody else And if its abhorrent for a gay man and its abhorrent for a lesbian woman and its abhorrent for a bisexual person then its abhorrent for a trans person

People need to understand that conversion therapy doesnt work 

I dont want anyone to go through what I went through its not just the socalled therapy but its everything you have to deal with afterwards

The women who are all black and in their late teens or early 20s when they say the incidents happened decided to tell their stories in the aftermath of anonymous allegations of inappropriate behaviour about Westwood circulating on social media in June 2020

In a statement at the time the DJ denied any wrongdoing saying the claims online were fabricated false and without foundation

Speaking to the Guardian and BBC for a new joint investigation Isabel said she wanted to pursue a career in music and that At that moment he was the main gatekeeper for access to what I needed to do

Boris Johnsons cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin They know exactly what they are doing The lies they are telling

Labours deputy leader Angela Rayner has hit out at the sexism and misogyny in politics after a newspaper reported that she crosses and uncrosses her legs during prime ministers questions to distract Boris Johnson

The Mail on Sunday reported that unnamed senior Tories had mischievously suggested that the Labour deputy leader deploys what it called a fully clothed parliamentary equivalent of Sharon Stones infamous scene in the 1992 film Basic Instinct

In the movie Stone  who plays a violent psychopathic killer  briefly flashes a police detective during an interrogation

Cabinet ministers including Johnson himself and scores of MPs condemned the Mail on Sunday report which the chair of the House of Commons women and equalities committee Caroline Nokes a Conservative called a dirty little story

The Mail on Sunday piece quoted a Tory MP saying She knows she cant compete with Boriss Oxford Union debating training but she has other skills which he lacks 

It also contrasted Rayners background as a former care worker who left school at 16 with that of the Old Etonian prime minister Rayner is widely regarded as performing strongly when she stands in for the Labour leader Keir Starmer against the PM

In a series of furious tweets on Sunday Rayner hit back against the anonymous briefing saying I stand accused of a ploy to distract the helpless PM  by being a woman having legs and wearing clothes  I am conspiring to put him off his stride

The potted biography is given  my comprehensive education my experience as a care worker my family my class my background The implication is clear

But it is the PM who is dragging the Conservative Party into the sewer  and the anonymous Tory MPs doing his bidding are complicit 

Johnson tweeted on Sunday As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today

How about this for innovation

In what they claim is a world first researchers have developed chopsticks that artificially create the taste of salt 

The team behind the device hopes the utensils will find an especially receptive audience in Japan where the traditional diet tends to be high in sodium due to the use of ingredients such as miso and soy sauce

The average Japanese adult consumes about 10 grams of salt a day double the amount recommended by the World Health Organization

Homei Miyashita a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo whose laboratory helped to develop the device said they plan to refine the prototype and hope to make the chopsticks available to consumers next year

What does Earth Day mean to you

For many climate campaigners its not a day to celebrate but to rise up and call out governments and companies who they say are putting profit before people

Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate says I think we should be protesting against the inaction of leaders and against empty promises

Many times on such days we see leaders coming out and speaking about what theyre going to do about what they think about the planet But these promises never match with action So we need to mind the gap between their words and their actions

vanessanakate1 is one of many campaigners using Earth Day to help raise awareness about a massive oil project in east Africa  and the dangers it could pose to the environment

The above images show how the same spot in Santiago Chile changed dramatically in just six years As a punishing recordbreaking drought enters its 13th year the country has taken the unprecedented decision to ration water for the capital  a city of nearly six million

A city cant live without water Claudio Orrego the governor of the Santiago metropolitan region said in a press conference last week

This is the first time Santiago in its 491year history has a water rationing plan due to the severity of climate change Orrego added Its important for citizens to understand that climate change is here to stay Its not just global its local

The Aculeo Lake which was for decades one of the main tourist attractions of Santiagos surroundings has disappeared due to a drought and overconsumption of water

The government estimates that the countrys water availability has dropped 10 to 37 over the last 30 years and could drop another 50 in northern and central Chile by 2060

This comes as climate scientists gave what is in effect their final warning for governments on the climate before it is too late This years Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC states the world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a now or never dash to a lowcarbon economy and society

How would you describe this photograph

The jury of the World Press Photo of the Year contest says it is an image that sears itself into your memory it inspires a kind of sensory reaction

Taken by photobracken in June 2021 it shows red dresses hung on crosses along a roadside in Canada to commemorate the children who died at the Kamloops Indian residential school in British Colombia

The institution was part of a crossCanada network of residential schools created to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children by removing them from their homes and communities and forbidding them from speaking their native languages or performing cultural practices

Survivor testimony made it clear that sexual emotional and physical abuse was rife at the schools Thousands died of disease neglect and suicide many were never returned to their families

At least 150000 children attended such schools in what a historic 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission described as a cultural genocide targeting Canadas Indigenous people

Would you consider putting your pet on a vegan diet 

According to a new research they are healthier and safer for dogs than conventional meatbased diets as long as they are nutritionally complete

More than 2500 dogs were followed over a year with their owners completing surveys for the study which has been labelled as the largest of its kind to date

According to the peerreviewed analysis vegan dogs visited the vet less often and required fewer medications

Almost half the dogs fed conventional meatbased diets required nonroutine medication but only a third of the dogs fed vegan diets did so

Prof Andrew Knight at the University of Winchester UK who led the study said It revealed that the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs are nutritionally sound vegan diets

But Knight did add that further research is needed to confirm the findings

The key limitation of our study is that we didnt have a population of animals locked up in a research facility and fed one specific diet without any alteration  we studied what real dogs in normal homes ate and their health outcomes It gives us a good indication as to what the outcomes are for dogs in the real world

An increasing number of pet owners are considering changing their animals diets because of the damaging impact of overconsumption of meat on the environment as well as rising concerns over how farm animals are treated About 9bn 69bn of vegan pet food was sold worldwide in 2020 and the sector is growing fast

Justine Shotton the president of the British Veterinary Association added that There is a lot of ongoing research in the field of vegan dog diets and this paper adds to the body of evidence supporting its benefits However there is currently a lack of robust data mapping the health consequences of feeding a vegan diet to a large number of dogs over many years

Although we would not recommend it it is theoretically possible to feed a dog a vegetarian diet but owners would need to take expert veterinary advice to avoid dietary deficiencies and associated disease

From today  anyone entering the UK illegally  as well as those who have arrived illegally since January 1st  may now be relocated to Rwanda

This is Boris Johnsons latest announcement The British prime minister continued The deal we have done is uncapped and Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead 

The UK government has been floating the prospect of offshore processing for asylum seekers for some time but the assumption had been that people might be flown offshore ie to a country abroad to have their claims for asylum in the UK processed with those found to qualify eventually being allowed to return

Under this plan people would instead only be offered the chance to seek asylum in Rwanda It will be a oneway ticket as BBCs home affairs editor Mark Easton said this morning

Home secretary Priti Patel is currently in Rwanda signing the deal and has said people resettled in Rwanda will be given support for up to five years covering training accommodation and healthcare so they can resettle and thrive She claims the plan fully complies with all international and national law

There were reports today that the plan would only apply to adult males But the Home Office press release implies that any asylum seekers arriving in the UK on small boats could be sent to Rwanda

The plan has sparked fierce criticism with many describing it as evil and inhumane

Ian Blackford the Scottish National partys Westminster leader told BBC Radio 4s Today programme Its just chilling absolutely chilling to think that people who are coming here for a whole host of reasons  vulnerable people  are going to be taken all the way to Africa to be processed

This is not the mark of a civilised society Its evil It just turns my stomach to see that our government acting in our name can behave in such a way and I think a lot of people are going to be quite aghast

Remember partygate

In an unprecedented development the British prime minister and his chancellor are both set to be fined for breaking their own emergency laws brought in to protect the UK during the coronavirus pandemic

Following a police investigation into Downing Street parties during lockdown Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are now believed to be the first people in their positions ever to have broken the law while in office

The Labour leader Keir Starmer has called on Johnson and Sunak to resign saying that they have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public There are also questions over whether Johnson misled parliament as when the partygate allegations were coming to light the prime minister told MPs in the Commons that all Covid rules were followed

Nicola Sturgeon the Scottish first minister and SNP leader has added that Boris Johnson must resign  He broke the law and repeatedly lied to parliament about it The basic values of integrity and decency  essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy  demand that he go And he should take his out of touch chancellor with him

The fines relate to parties held in Downing Street during lockdown and are likely to include a gathering in the cabinet room for Johnsons birthday in June 2020 which was also attended by Sunak

However No 10 gave no details on how many events the prime minister will be fined for attending and would not say whether he would contest the fine  likely to be 20 or 50  or pay them straight away

A No 10 spokesperson said The prime minister and chancellor of the Exchequer have today received notification that the Metropolitan police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices We have no further details but we will update you again when we do

If you look at our necklaces they used to be tight around our necks But now that we have nothing to eat they are loose says Uapona Kapumbu pictured on slide seven She left Angola when drought killed her familys livestock

The threat of famine caused by the countrys worst drought in four decades has forced thousands of people to migrate south to seek help across the border in neighbouring Namibia

Most rural communities rely on growing their own food to eat such as maize and millet but now the harsh weather has destroyed their main source of food  and killed livestock across southern Angola

The Red Cross has reported an increase in people entering Namibia from Angola including breastfeeding women children and older people Nearly all are on foot

Many of the women are staying at the refugee camps on the border with their children and babies But with not enough shelters some are having to sleep on the floor without any protection from the cold

The votes are in Ketanji Brown Jackson is the first Black woman to be appointed to the US supreme court in its 233year history

Jackson who currently serves on the US court of appeals for the DC Circuit will replace Justice Stephen Breyer 83 the most senior member of the courts liberal bloc Breyer for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career said he intends to retire from the court this summer

At 51 Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades Her ascension however will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court dominated by a 63 conservative majority

Her confirmation to the lifetime post represents the fulfillment of a promise Biden made to his supporters during his 2020 campaign for president when he vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court if elected president and a vacancy arose

During her public hearings Jackson vowed to be an independent justice who would seek to ensure that the words inscribed on the marbled supreme court building  Equal Justice Under the Law  were a reality and not just an ideal 

With her parents and daughters present Jackson recounted for the Senate judiciary committee her familys generational journey as the daughter of public school teachers raised in the segregated south who would rise to become a justice on a court that once denied Black Americans citizenship

Were not extremists were extremely tired read a protest sign held up by Surav Harris a young Sri Lankan protester in Colombo last week

The Sri Lankan military have warned of tough action against protesters after hundreds took to the street calling for government accountability and for the president to resign as the country endures its worst economic crisis in decades

Some demonstrators clashed with police and military on Thursday outside president Gotabaya Rajapaksas residence in a suburb of the capital Colombo He then declared a nationwide public emergency and ordered a social media blackout This was rescinded later in the day after the countrys Human Rights Commission ruled that the defence ministry had no power to impose the censorship

The south Asian nation is facing a severe shortages of food fuel and other essentials  along with record inflation and crippling power cuts  in its most painful downturn since independence from Britain in 1948

A critical lack of foreign currency has left Sri Lanka struggling to service its ballooning 51bn foreign debt with the pandemic torpedoing vital revenue from tourism

Many economists also say the crisis has been exacerbated by government mismanagement years of accumulated borrowing and illadvised tax cuts

On Monday Rajapaskas entire cabinet resigned and his ruling government has lost its parliamentary majority after a mass wave of defections

And the countrys most powerful trade union has now declared a national health emergency over a lifethreatening shortage of drugs

How would you describe this object

Some have called it a magnetic turd and others have said its amazing and a tiny bit terrifying

But its cocreator Prof Li Zhang of the Chinese University of Hong Kong says it is a magnetic slime robot that could be used in a medical setting

And while the team have no immediate plans to do so they envisage the slime could be useful in the digestive system for example in reducing the harm from a small swallowed battery

The ultimate goal is to deploy it like a robot Zhang said

The slime has viscoelastic properties she said meaning that sometimes it behaves like a solid sometimes it behaves like a liquid

The magnetic particles in the slime however are toxic themselves The researchers coated the slime in a layer of silica  the main component in sand  to form a hypothetically protective layer

The safety would also strongly depend on how long you would keep them inside of your body Zhang said

Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russias public image is now one of torture and execution after the retreat of Russian forces in the town of Bucha led to the discovery of the killing of hundreds of civilians

Calling Russian soldiers murderers butchers and rapists Zelenskiy said late on Sunday Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women He warned that even worse things may be found in other occupied regions

Witnesses of alleged atrocities in Bucha told the Guardian that Russian soldiers had fired on men fleeing the town and had killed civilians at will

Taras Schevchenko 43 said Russian soldiers had refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor instead shooting at them as they fled across an open field Bodies he said were scattered on the pavements with some of those killed having been squashed by tanks  like animal skin rugs

Russia denied responsibility for the killing of civilians Its defence ministry described the photos and videos from towns such as Bucha as another staged performance by the Kyiv regime echoing a similar claim made after the bombing of a childrens and maternity hospital in Mariupol

Vakarchuk lead singer of okeanelzyofficial was supposed to be playing the rock bands latest album to packed venues across the world from April

However after a visit to a hospital in Zaporizhzhia a city in southeastern Ukraine shortly after the Russian invasion he decided to dramatically change course

Travelling across the country the rock star performed on the frontline in hospitals on underground platforms where civilians shelter from the bombs and a host of recently shelled hotspots all in total secrecy to avoid being targeted by Russian forces

sviatoslavvakarchuk keeps with him as a talisman a toy car left by his ninemonthold son Ivan who was taken to safety three weeks ago

Vakarchuk  whose popularity is such that twothirds of Ukrainians wanted him to stand for president in 2019  says he is doing this to make people feel that I am with them adding though that he is worried about his safety

The US politician Rufus Gifford has posted a moving Twitter thread explaining his disappointment after the Florida governor signed the controversial Dont say gay bill into law yesterday

The policy has drawn intense national scrutiny from critics who argue it risks marginalising LGBTQ people

The bill forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through to third grade

After that these topics must be ageappropriate However the law does not define this term and there are fears it is so vaguely worded that speech could be muzzled in public schools

Parents will be able to sue school districts over any violations

Ron DeSantis a potential 2024 presidential candidate and Republicans say the bill is reasonable They argue that parents not teachers should broach subjects of sexual orientation and gender identity with children

President Joe Biden hit back Our LGBTQI youth deserve to be affirmed and accepted just as they are

Florida is the first US state to pass the bill but others are considering similar laws including Georgia Tennessee Indiana Oklahoma and Kansas

These tweets share a personal account by rufusgifford  the chief of protocol of the US and an openly gay politician The former US ambassador has explained how lifechanging positive LGBTQ representation would have been when he was younger

Both could help our current international oil crisis according to the global energy watchdog

The International Energy Agency IEA has suggested a 10point plan to help reduce global oil demand

The IEAs plan could help cut oil usage by 27m barrels per day bpd of oil within four months

Currently the world uses about 100m bpd of oil which isnt sustainable

Drastically bringing down the worlds oil consumption would help ease skyhigh oil prices that are hurting consumers reduce reliance on Kremlincontrolled resources and be better for the planet

We girls have always fought and we still fight

This video follows an Afghan girl who dreams of becoming a doctor She was studying at school until the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in midAugust 2021

Since then girls have been banned from education beyond middle school in most of the country

Initially the Taliban said they hoped that girls could return to school by the end of March

But this week as many pupils were preparing to return to class after a sixmonth enforced break the Taliban went back on this decision

Lots of excited girls were already waiting outside the school They were here hours before their classes started a schoolteacher in Kabul said

Then we told them about the new order Many of them started arguing I had nothing to tell them

The new Taliban claim to be more moderate and insist that they support every girls right to education but 25 years ago they said the same thing and girls never returned to school under their rule

For the Afghan girls  like the aspiring doctor in this video  its been devastating to see their brothers going to school when they cant

I feel Im not allowed to advance any more I feel I am no longer a member of Afghanistan

This was written by Jamaican politician Lisa Hanna in the Guardian as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge continued their Caribbean tour in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Queens reign

Politicians and protesters in Jamaica Belize and the Bahamas  where William and Catherine have been visiting  are calling on the royals to apologise for their familys historical role in the slave trade They are also calling for the removal of the Queen as their heads of state and on Britain to pay reparations

The Duke of Cambridge gave a speech in Jamaica expressing profound sorrow for the appalling atrocity of slavery but stopped short of the apology activists had demanded

Hanna writes When we in Jamaica say respect we mean it We respect you We respect Prince William and Catherine We respect the British people We respect your leaders When you visit Jamaica we are polite to you We are cordial to you We give you the time of your life on holiday We laugh with you We cry with you All we ask is for reciprocity by taking our advocacy seriously and that together we can right the historical wrongs and reset the political economic and social system for future generations

Where do you buy your flowers

Flowers are a thoughtful gift  whether its Mothers Day Valentines Day or just because

But behind every bouquet theres a significant environmental cost

In 2018 360000 tonnes of CO2 were produced from Valentines Day flowers in the US

Thats roughly equivalent to driving 78000 cars for a whole year

Most florists in the UK and US import their blooms from other countries such as Colombia Ecuador Sri Lanka Kenya and the Netherlands

That means the majority of flowers you see whilst shopping will already have a big carbon footprint  but dont lose hope

There are many ways you can reduce the environmental damage of your bouquet

Two years ago Covid took the life of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab at the age of 13 It also took his familys chance to lay him to rest

Two siblings of Ismail believed at the time to be the first child in the UK to die with the virus began displaying symptoms shortly before his funeral meaning his relatives had to selfisolate

His case was among those to prompt government ministers to rethink the rules around funerals with the then health secretary Matt Hancock saying the sight of his coffin being lowered into a grave without a member of his family present was too awful

Around the world over six million people have tragically lost their lives to the virus In the UK around 164000 people are reported to have died from contracting Covid19

As today marks the second anniversary of the UKs first lockdown our team has collated 24 tributes for people who have died from coronavirus  one for every month since  Ismail being the first tribute

His family described him as a gentle and kind boy with a heartwarming smile the BBC reported His sister later told reporters I think with everything happening so fast it is hard to accept reality especially when you dont see them during their last moments

It wasnt her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself

After spending six years as a silent figure detained in Iran we finally heard Nazanin ZaghariRatcliffe speak publicly yesterday at a press conference in London

Nazanin  dressed in the yellow and blue of Ukraine  began by thanking her family both in the UK and Iran before going on to say that her freedom would never be total until other detainees  such as Morad Tahbaz whose eldest daughter Roxanne was also at the presser  were also released

Then she let rip writes Guardian political sketch writer John Crace A very controlled fury Icy almost steely We had been warned Nazanin wouldnt be making any overtly political remarks and that any such statements would be left to Richard and Siddiq Only no one appeared to have told Nazanin She wasnt going to settle for anything cosy and heartwarming It wasnt her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself he continues

At several points during the conference ZaghariRatcliffe differed from her husband when he thanked the British government for bringing her home

She said she had seen five foreign secretaries over the course of six years adding That is unprecedented given the politics of the UK I love you Richard respect whatever you believe but I was told many many times Oh were going to get you home That never happened

She said this resulted in her finding it difficult to place trust in the words of successive foreign secretaries adding I mean how many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home Five

We all know  how I came home It should have happened exactly six years ago I should not have been in prison for six years

After hearing ZaghariRatcliffe speak some people accused her of being ungrateful  a judgement that was met with a great backlash of people pointing out that she does not owe gratitude but is instead owed an explanation Swipe to read more

Do you think Russian president Vladimir Putins actions in Ukraine should be seen as war crimes

US President Joe Biden and Britains defence minister James Heappey think so In addition the prosecutor of the international criminal court ICC in The Hague Karim Khan has launched an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine

Khan said that although Ukraine was not a member of the ICC it has given the court its approval to examine alleged atrocities on its territory He said that there are grounds to open an investigation based on a previous preliminary investigation on the occupied territories of Crimea and the Donbas published last year and also on current events in Ukraine

Khan said we must insist that there is zero tolerance for any crimes of sexual genderbased violence or crimes against children and that is going to be increasingly important as urban warfare intensifies

No person with a gun or a missile or a plane or a mortar has a licence to target civilians Civilian objects and civilians must be protected Prisoners of war must be treated humanely

But what does it mean to be a war criminal Where do they get tried Who decides And who has been tried in the past

The head of the World Health Organization has urged the world not to forget the humanitarian crisis in Tigray saying that even amid the war in Ukraine there is nowhere on Earth where people are more at risk than in the isolated region of northern Ethiopia

As the 16month conflict between Tigrayan forces and Ethiopian government forces drags on more than two million people have been displaced  and there are an estimated 454000 malnourished children in the region

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus WHO director general is from Tigray and has incurred the wrath of the government in the past after accusing it of placing the region under a de facto blockade Prime minister Abiy Ahmeds government has denied this claim and accused him of bias and spreading misinformation

At a press conference on Wednesday Tedros implicitly addressed those concerns saying Yes Im from Tigray And this crisis affects me my family and my friends very personally  But as the director general of WHO I have a duty to protect and promote health wherever its under threat And there is nowhere on earth where the health of millions of people is more under threat

Alluding to the Russian invasion of its neighbour he added Just as we continue to call on Russia to make peace in Ukraine so we continue to call on Ethiopia and Eritrea to end the blockade the siege  to save lives

The UN has been unable to get emergency food supplies into Tigray since midDecember Doctors at Tigrays biggest hospital told the Guardian earlier this month that patients were dying due to a lack of oxygen and medicines

On Wednesday Tedros said there was no treatment available for 46000 people with HIV And the programme has been abandoned People with tuberculosis hypertension diabetes and cancer are also not being treated and may have died he added

A black child was subjected by police to a strip search at her London school that involved exposure of intimate body parts according to an investigation which found racism was likely to have been an influencing factor in the officers actions

Someone walked into the school where I was supposed to feel safe took me away from the people who were supposed to protect me and stripped me naked while on my period the 15yearold said in a statement adding that she did not know if she would ever feel normal again

No appropriate adult was present during the girls ordeal which took place without parental consent and in the knowledge that she was menstruating

The child was made to bend over spread her legs and use her hands to spread her buttocks while coughing and she is now in therapy and selfharming following the incident in December 2020 according to family members statements to the inquiry

The report emphasised the importance of the question of whether the girl referred to as Child Q  was treated differently because she was black adding this line of inquiry had been starkly reflected in several events that took place around the same time

Police were called by teachers who told the review that they believed she was smelling strongly of cannabis and suspected she was carrying drugs but none were found

The Metropolitan police have apologised for what a senior officer described as the childs truly regrettable treatment which has been the subject of a separate Independent Office for Police Conduct IOPC investigation

The childs mother said Their position in the school is being part of the safeguarding team but they were not acting as if they were a part of that team This makes me sick  the fact that my child had to take her sanitary towel off and put the same dirty towel back on because they would not allow her to use the restroom to clean herself

As the UK prepares to open its borders to Ukrainian refugees and with over 89000 Britons offering to house them in the newlyannounced Homes for Ukraine scheme some have claimed that this is the continuation of a noble tradition in the UK of welcoming refugees

Journalist Simon Heffer said on BBC Radio 4 We have a noble tradition of looking after refugees I think back to the kindertransport

Senior Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland posted a widelyshared thread on Twitter explaining the problem with citing the 193839 kindertransport as proof of Britains history of opening its doors to refugees in need

A lot of how you perceive the war depends on where you get your news says Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center

Vladimir Putins decision to start a war with Russias neighbour has seen many Ukrainian families torn apart as their adult men are forced to stay behind and fight while other members of the family flee the violence

But Russia has also been experiencing its own family rifts  between those who back the war and those who oppose it Often that divide runs along generational lines with younger Russians against the war in Ukraine falling out with older relatives reliant on a diet of state propaganda

Victoria Gogh and Dmitry live in Russia and oppose Putins invasion of Ukraine This has caused tension with members of their families who support the war

Since the beginning of the war both Victoria and Dmitry have tried to tell their parents the truth about Putins regime and offer them different news to what they consume through Russias state news and media

The Russian state media has been mobilised to portray the war as a special military operation aimed at liberating Ukraine and protecting citizens in Donbas from Ukrainian genocide Videos of Russian bombs hitting cities have been described as staged by Ukraine

In the past polling has found that television remains the biggest news source for Russians with more than 60 of the population relying on it for information Russians over 65 are 51 more likely to watch television than under25s

If you watch television you are simply more likely to toe the official line And older people tend to watch more TV explains Andrei Kolesnikov

We see that a majority of Russians appear to support the countrys actions at least the way these actions are presented to them by the media Kolesnikov said

He said it was unsurprising given the sensitivity of the topic that the war had created tensions between families and friends It is very hard for people to accept that their side are actually the bad guys

The deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said the city was being shelled continuously and 1170 residents had died 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday Its medieval he said Its pure genocide The attack isnt simply treacherous Its a war crime

The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials accounts but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack

Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was at the maximum and again called on the west to impose a nofly zone saying it risked a humanitarian catastrophe if it did not

He called the Russians Nazis in an interview with Sky News saying If you are united against the Nazis and this terror you have to close Dont wait for me ask you several times a million times Close the sky He warned that otherwise millions could die

These heartbreaking images show the apocalyptic conditions that people in the heavily bombed port of Mariupol Ukraine are facing

Hundreds of thousands of residents have been sheltering for more than a week without water or power anxiously waiting for news of evacuation efforts

Ukraines deputy prime minister said the country will try to evacuate civilians from six besieged cities including Mariupol

Up to now there have been repeated attempts to establish a humanitarian corridor to ease the suffering only for ceasefire agreements to collapse and heavy shelling to continue

As the fighting continues there are fears of worsening death tolls and journalists in Mariupol describe seeing corpses lying in the streets and hungry people breaking into stores in search of food and melting snow for water

This situation is really apocalyptic for people it is getting worse they are running out of essential supplies said Ewan Watson spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross

Today Ukraine says Russia has agreed to stop firing in areas of humanitarian corridors from 9am to 9pm local time 7am7pm GMT

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors have largely failed due to attacks by Russian forces and there were few details on Wednesdays new effort

Have you spotted any of this disinformation being spread online

Untrue claims about genocide and authorities in Kyiv supporting nazism are among the most common falsehoods pushed online amid the RussiaUkraine conflict according to analysis by NewsGuard

This comes as Facebook Instagram TikTok and Youtube have taken action to block access to the Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik

Russia employs a multilayered strategy to introduce amplify and spread false and distorted narratives across the world  relying on a mix of official state media sources anonymous websites and accounts and other methods to distribute propaganda that advances the Kremlins interests and undermines its adversaries the analysis said

While on air CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie DAgata stated last week that Ukraine isnt a place with all due respect like Iraq or Afghanistan that has seen conflict raging for decades This is a relatively civilised relatively European  I have to choose those words carefully too  city one where you wouldnt expect that or hope that its going to happen

Outrage immediately mounted online and the veteran correspondent quickly apologised but since Russia began its largescale invasion on 24 February many journalists from around the world have echoed similar sentiments  largely followed by apologies

Writing in the Telegraph Daniel Hannan explained They seem so like us That is what makes it so shocking Ukraine is a European country Its people watch Netflix and have Instagram accounts vote in free elections and read uncensored newspapers War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations

The USbased Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association was deeply troubled by the coverage recently issuing a statement on the matter Ameja condemns and categorically rejects orientalist and racist implications that any population or country is uncivilised or bears economic factors that make it worthy of conflict reads the statement

This type of commentary reflects the pervasive mentality in western journalism of normalising tragedy in parts of the world such as the Middle East Africa south Asia and Latin America Such coverage the report correctly noted dehumanises and renders their experience with war as somehow normal and expected

We spoke with Goldsmiths University professor Dr Omega Douglas  who is an expert in race representation and international reporting  about what language is being used what it says about our society and what steps we can take to prevent this sort of rhetoric in the future

Ron DeSantis the governor of Florida and a serious contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 berated students standing on stage with him for wearing masks against Covid19

At the start of a press event at South Florida University in Tampa on Wednesday the governor said you do not have to wear those masks while pointing his finger at the youngsters

Speaking to a WFLA reporter about the incident one high school student said he was surprised and shocked adding that he felt a little pressured

Federal authorities have relaxed mask guidance in much of the US but the coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 950000  and more than 70000 in Florida alone

I have seen many scientific reports in my time but nothing like this

Todays IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership said Antnio Guterres the UN secretary general
after the worlds foremost body of climate researchers the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC issued their latest warning on global heating

In what some scientists termed the bleakest warning yet the landmark report from the IPCC said climate breakdown is accelerating rapidly many of the impacts will be more severe than predicted and there is only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages

The scientific evidence is unequivocal climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet said HansOtto Prtner a cochair of working group 2 of the IPCC Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future

This is the second part of the IPCCs latest assessment report which deals with the impacts of climate breakdown sets out areas where the world is most vulnerable and details how we can try to adapt and protect against some of the impacts It is the sixth since the IPCC was first convened by the UN in 1988 and may be the last to be published while there is still some chance of avoiding the worst

Women girls and people able to bear children are the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies

Clad in green  the colour adopted by the prochoice movement  crowds of people celebrated in Colombias capital Bogot yesterday as abortion was decriminalised during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy

The historic move adds to a recent string of legal victories for reproductive rights in Latin America including a series of rulings in Mexico and Argentina that lowered barriers to abortion

Abortion in Colombia has previously only been allowed where there was a risk to the life or health of the pregnant mother the existence of lifethreatening foetal malformations or when the pregnancy was the result of rape incest or nonconsensual artificial insemination

Reproductive rights groups estimate that as many as 400000 abortions are performed each year in Colombia with only 10 carried out legally During 2020 at least 26223 unsafe abortions were carried out across the country according to Profamilia  a local reproductive healthcare provider

Latin America a traditionally conservative region with a powerful Catholic and evangelical Christian lobby has some of the worlds most restrictive abortion laws often banning the procedure outright

In El Salvador for example dozens of women have been jailed for homicide after suffering obstetric emergencies

Erika GuevaraRosas Americas director at Amnesty International said We celebrate this ruling as a historic victory  Women girls and people able to bear children are the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies Now instead of punishing them the Colombian authorities will have to recognise their autonomy over their bodies and their life plans

Eugenia Lopez Uribe the International Planned Parenthood Foundations regional director for Americas and the Caribbean region added  the Green Wave is strong and growing and the fight for reproductive rights and justice will not end until every person can access highquality sexual and reproductive healthcare when and where they need it

Had you heard the term kleptocrat before 

A massive leak from one of the worlds biggest private banks Credit Suisse has exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture drug trafficking money laundering corruption and other serious crimes

The findings points to widespread failures of due diligence by the bank despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets given exclusive access to the data

One of the most notorious cases in Credit Suisses history involved the corrupt Philippine dictator and kleptocrat Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda The couple are estimated to have siphoned as much as 10bn from the Philippines during the three terms Ferdinand was president which ended in 1986

The leak revealed that in 2000 Credit Suisse gave an account to an attorney who eight years earlier had been convicted of helping the Marcoses launder money

On Twitter today after the investigation was published sociologist ashpresto wrote Marcoses stole an estimated 513720000000PHP The average annual income is 313348PHP Meaning the Marcoses stole the yearly income of an average Filipino for 163970635 MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF MILLION years of work

Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly farreaching crime The consequences for already impoverished populations can be devastating as state coffers are siphoned basic standards are eroded and trust in democracy plummets

Credit Suisse said that Switzerlands strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients and strongly rejected the allegations and inferences about the banks purported business practices

The bank also said the allegations were largely historical in some instances dating back to a time when laws practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now

Patrick Jones 43 has been homeless since he was 12

Pictured on the cover of this gallery his portrait is one of the many powerful and thought provoking images featured in photographer Robert Gumperts new book Division Street

The project is an exploration of the stark divide between San Franciscos haves and havenots  and though all the pictures were captured in the Californian city Gumpert told the SF Public Press the book is actually the story of America  I think its an honest look at todays society 

A recent examination of 20 US urban areas found the number of deaths among people living without housing shot up by 77 in the five years ending in 2020

In 2016 when the Super Bowl came to San Francisco many homeless people were urged to move to the ironically named Division Street Its reported that city officers hoped this would mean those sleeping rough would remain invisible to the visiting crowds

At the same time Gumpert started talking with and photographing people he met who were living on the street and in shelters He says Without the understanding of the people I have met on the streets their remarkable generosity of spirit and trust this project would never have happened

Who will be paying for Prince Andrews settlement with Virginia Giuffre

The sum is undisclosed but lawyers say it is certain to run into the millions with estimates ranging from 5m to 14m

Such eyewatering figures have prompted calls for the source of the funds to be made public particularly amid suggestions that the Queen will have to bail out her son

Andrew is known to be trying to sell his 17m ski chalet in Verbier Switzerland but it is understood to be heavily mortgaged and the net proceeds are unlikely to cover the costs

The surprise outofcourt agreement means Andrew makes no admission of guilt over the claims by Giuffre that she was trafficked to have sex with the Queens son on three occasions when she was 17

For months Prince Andrew has been clear about the accusations of sexual assault he faced from Giuffre they were baseless and he would fight them all the way in court

This week he agreed to a settlement that states he had never intended to malign Ms Giuffres character and that he recognised she had suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks Andrew also pledged to demonstrate his regret for his association with the sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein

The settlement will cost him millions of pounds in legal fees on top of the undisclosed amount he has agreed to hand over reported to be around 12m

Theres nothing pretty about wage theft

That was the message protesters displayed last night outside MollyMae Hagues Pretty Little Thing PLT fashion show in London

Demonstrators accused the parent brand boohoo PLC Ltd of being built on worker exploitation and contributing to the fast fashion crisis

They were demanding that the brands ensure their suppliers pay their garment workers fair living wages and recognise their unions and that the brands commit to a drastic reduction in output

Claims in some of the posters about the wages paid to Leicester garment workers supplying boohoo were rejected by the company boohoo group PLC said Any suggestion that the people making clothes for PLT or any other boohoo group PLC brand are paid lower than the minimum wage is grossly inaccurate

We publish a list of all our approved UK and international manufacturers all of whom have been audited over the last 18 months and we do not tolerate any noncompliance with our supplier Code of Conduct We operate a whistleblowing hotline so people can share any concerns they may have and we work with relevant government agencies to ensure the people who make our clothes have their rights in the workplace protected

Fair fashion campaigner Venetia La Manna image one and Mayisha of ohsoethical  organised the protests They said Boohoo have been repeatedly confronted with the reality their garment workers face across their supply chain for years It has been widely documented particularly in the June 2020 report by Labour Behind the Label which exposed the horrific conditions workers were subjected to in the pandemic

Boohoo and its friends have made the choice to depend on sweatshop labour and our planet is suffering the consequences of their greed

PLT has just announced a resale platform where users can sell and buy secondhand items from any brand but venetialamanna says this is shameless greenwashing

These birds are being recruited to pick up discarded cigarette butts from the streets and squares of a Swedish city as part of a costcutting drive

The crows carry out the task as they receive some food for every butt that they deposit in a bespoke machine designed by a startup in Sdertlje near Stockholm

They are wild birds taking part on a voluntary basis said Christian GntherHanssen the founder of Corvid Cleaning the company behind the method

The Keep Sweden Tidy Foundation says that more than 1bn cigarette butts are left on Swedens streets each year representing 62 of all litter Sdertlje spends 20m Swedish kronor 16m on street cleaning

GntherHanssen estimates his method could save at least 75 of costs involved with picking up cigarette butts in the city

Sdertlje is carrying out a pilot project before potentially rolling out the operation across the city with the health of the birds being the key consideration given the type of waste involved

A typical drag king performance often involves a cisgender woman transgender man or nonbinary person in male or masculine drag on stage singing lipsyncing and dancing  all with the aim to trying to dismantle the patriarchy and empower LGBTQ people

Their performances take on male stereotypes and toxic masculinity while exploring issues around mental health sexuality and gender identity

With the art of being a drag queen you get feminine energy which is beautiful and elegant explains drag king Chiyo prinxchiyo

But drag kings we work with masculinity which is toxic and boring and gross So we have to find a way to make masculinity not only entertaining but not toxic and show people what healthy masculinity can look like

Drag King Beau Jangles beaujanglesdrag says Without doing drag kinging I wouldnt have realised that Im nonbinary as quickly  It was very important to me when I was figuring out my queerness as a way of tapping into the masculinity that I had been told I wasnt allowed to

Scottish drag king Dorian T Fisk doriantfisk wants to see drag kings on an equal footing with the queens A lot more show bookers are booking kings so were starting to even out a little bit  but there is a lot of work to be done

Aotearoas native alpine parrot species the kea is known for its curious and mischievous nature  and for swiping wallets jewellery packed lunches windscreen wipers and other valuables from unsuspecting tourists and visitors

Alexandra Verheul from Dunedin had been hiking the Kepler Track with her family when the bird seized its opportunity The device had been set down on a balcony at their hut and was quickly nabbed by the kea described by the National Geographic as a very curious parrot

It immediately took flight all the while filming its glorious getaway The GoPro captured the airborne escape as well as the keas landing and brief slightly frenzied attack on the camera

Verheul told local TV programme Seven Sharp We just followed the sound down there  theyd obviously heard us coming and abandoned the GoPro  My son decided to go check the rocks where it looked like a good place for a bird to land and there it was still sitting there still filming

Are you a fan of any of these books

From red scare to read scare  these are just some of the books that Republicans are trying to ban in schools across America

All of the above books appear on a list of 850 titles compiled by the Texan Republican and state lawmaker Matt Krause who is investigating which schools hold them

His campaign follows the states new antiCritical Race Theory bill which bans teaching any materials that could cause students discomfort guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individuals race or sex

His list might only be circulating in Texas but many of the books on his list have already been subject to challenges across the US or banned in certain school districts

In Pennsylvania one school board has banned a long list of books almost entirely titles by or about people of color This includes Ijeoma Oluos So You Want to Talk about Race slide two and Ibram X Kendis How to be Antiracist slide three

Meanwhile TaNehisi Coates Between the World and Me slide two has been the subject of numerous challenges across the US and was reportedly banned by an Ohio school board in 2020

Groups purporting to be grassroots efforts have frequently led the charge petitioning school boards or elected officials to remove certain books Though some of these organizations present themselves as a local effort that sprang up around groups of parents united behind a cause many of the groups involved in banning books are in fact linked and backed by influential conservative donors

Deborah CaldwellStone director of the American Library Associations Office for Intellectual Freedom said the number of attempts to ban books had soared through 2021

Whats unique is it appears to be an organized effort by a number of advocacy groups to activate members in local chapters to challenge books in school libraries and public libraries in the United States she said

Could pillow fighting be the next great combat sport No seriously 

Theres just something so cathartic about getting hit in the head with a pillow says entrepreneur Steve Williams who has created the Pillow Fighting Championships PFC and even organised a payperview event

Williams is framing PFC as the next UFCthe largest mixed martial arts MMA organization in the worldborrowing heavily from the latters franchising business model and lurid aggressive branding Going doortodoor selling the martialarts studios and boxing gyms of south Florida on his concept he recruited dozens of active MMA fighters reality TV stars bareknuckle boxers mechanics single moms and veterinarians to start training with his pillows  and now it is a professional combat sport

Described as hardcore swinging with specialised pillows competitors win by hitting their opponent in the head the most across three 90second rounds The pillows  which make a crinkling sound like a dry diaper when held still and crack like a horsewhip when connecting with a cheekbone  are queensized stuffed with foam and encased in nylon sailcloth

You dont really need to explain pillow fighting to peoplethats the beauty says Williams As he sees it pillow fighting is not just a gimmick Theres hardcore aggression with pillow fighting but nobody gets hurt A lot of people dont want to see the blood and violence anymore

Just what the doctor ordered

Research has found that spending just two hours in nature per week significantly boosts health and wellbeing  And so in Canada this is being made part of treatment plans for both physical and mental health

Parks Canada the agency that manages the countrys 38 national parks and ten national park reserves is collaborating with Canadas national nature prescription programme PaRx to allow registered healthcare professionals to provide a free annual passes to patients

The pass would usually cost 72 CAD 57 USD per adult for a year of unlimited access to national parks but this initiative would allow some doctors to prescribe them for free

So this is all about breaking down those barriers to access to nature PaRx director Dr Melissa Lem told Global News

Theres this huge body of research showing that nature time can improve all kinds of different physical and mental health conditions from diabetes and heart disease to ADHD and depression she explained

The PaRx program is aiming to be nationwide by the end of 2022 and has already signed up over 1000 prescribers

The Black Cop a short film commissioned by Guardian Documentaries and supported by the BFI Doc Society Fund has been nominated for a BAFTA Film Award

This intimate portrait of Gamal G Turawa an exMetropolitan police officer explores his memories of racially profiling and harassing black people and homophobia in his early career

Now an openly gay man Turawas story is a multilayered one and sits in the centre of three pivotal moments in recent British history from the black communities resistance of oppressive policing to the push for LGBTQIA equality and the aftermath of the west African farming phenomenon where white families took care of black children outside the remit of local authorities

In one person and one story we present a villain victim and hero and begin to understand the potential that we all have in being any one of these even all three says director and producer cherishoteka

It is a huge honour to have this important and nuanced story recognised by BAFTA My work aims to provide a platform for oftenmarginalised communities to tell their stories on their terms

With more than 1400 civilians dead hundreds of thousands displaced and an economy on the brink of collapse Myanmar is in crisis

In February 2021 the countrys progress towards democracy was stalled when the military seized power

A few days after the coup mass protests erupted in Yangon and across Myanmar and towards the end of the month the junta began deploying increasingly violent tactics from water cannon beatings and rubber bullets to live ammunition It has been accused of targeting civilians hunting public sector workers and blocking aid as part of an attempt to crush the widespread resistance to military rule

Internet blackouts arbitrary arrests a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people in Myanmar 

A study conducted by the UN Development Programme in May and June 2021 predicted that urban poverty would triple by early 2022 compared with 2019 levels

For a new special series Reporting Myanmar the Guardians Rights and Freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists in the country many working in secret to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience

A rainweakened hillside collapsed in Ecuadors capital Quito sweeping over homes and a sports field and killing at least 24 people city officials have said

Neighbours joined rescue workers in hunting through the ruins for survivors of the disaster that hit after nearly 24 hours of rainfall

The storm was pounding outside when Imelda Pacheco said she felt her house move as if an earthquake had struck Suddenly water and rocks began to pour in through doors and windows and she fled before the building was destroyed

I barely had time to grab the hand of my fouryearold son and I ran to the stairs to the terrace Suddenly the walls in front and to the side disappeared she told the Associated Press

Quito mayor Santiago Guarderas said the intense rains had saturated the soils setting off the landslide

Ive lost everything I dont have anything Everything is over said 65yearold Laura Quinez who stood beside an ambulance as her neighbours tried to recover appliances from their destroyed homes

Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of further landslides

Why exactly did these polar bears move into an abandoned weather station 

Last year photographer Dmitry Kokh captured these extraordinary set of images while on a trip to a Russias Wrangel Island  a Unescorecognised nature reserve thats often called a polar bear maternity ward It is one of only a few places on the planet where the animals can be found in large numbers

The island is very inaccessible which may be bad for tourists but is great for the animals says Kokh who added that I had dreamed about photographing polar bears for a long time

On the way to visit and learn more Kokh and his group received a warning about bad weather and took shelter in Kolyuchin which is known for the polar weather station that operated on it in Soviet times Though the station was closed in 1992 the abandoned village still stands

Suddenly we noticed movement in the windows of the houses said Kokh Someone took out some binoculars and we saw the heads of polar bears Fog a place long deserted by people polar bears  it was the perfect setting

The bears walked around the houses and among barrels left on the island a long time ago There were about 20 animals insight at the same time mostly males The females kept to the side with their cubs closer to the shores of the island

Kokh asked one of Russias top polar bear experts Anatoly Kochnev what causes the animals behaviour  why do they love to sit in the buildings

First of all polar bears are very curious by nature so they always attempt to get through any unlocked window or door And secondly unfortunately these animals were traditionally hunted and so they use these houses as a form of protection from humans said Kochnev

I still sometimes see polar bears in decaying windows before my eyes when falling asleep Kokh shared

These bears will continue to hunt swim among ice floes and explore islands even when civilisation ceases to exist But life will remain eternal only if we humans finally begin to take care of the planet and the living creatures that need our protection

Our data team put them together after a new report highlighted the vast energy inequality between rich and poor countries

The analysis by the Center for Global Development found each Briton produces 200 times the climate emissions of the average Congolese person with people in the US producing 585 times as much

In the first two days of January the average UK citizen was already responsible for more carbon emissions than someone from the Democratic Republic of the Congo would produce in an entire year the research found

By the end of January the carbon emitted by someone living in Britain will surpass the annual emissions of citizens of 30 low and middleincome countries the analysis also concluded

Euan Ritchie a policy analyst at CGD Europe said his work was prompted by the climate hypocrisy of western countries including the UK and the US that have pledged to stop aid funding to fossil fuel projects in developing states

The same countries will be able to continue to develop fossil fuels at home The US has at least 24 pending fossil fuel projects representing more than 16 gigatons of potential greenhouse gas emissions while the UK is licensing new oil and gas fields in the North Sea

Vijaya Ramachandran the director for energy and development at the Breakthrough Institute in Berkeley California argues that blanket bans on fossil fuel projects in poor countries are colonial and will entrench poverty while doing little to reduce the worlds carbon emissions

Its very easy for rich countries to impose fossil fuel financing bans on poor countries while at the same time increasing their own consumption of fossil fuels she said Its rank hypocrisy and its devastating for poor countries as they need a wide range of energy to fuel development

From Afghanistan to Ethiopia about 235 million people worldwide needed assistance in 2021  a number that is predicted to rise to 274 million people this year Globally that equals one in 28 people

But while some crises received global attention last year others are less well known and were often neglected by the worlds media

The humanitarian organisation Care International has published its annual report of the 10 countries that had the least attention in online articles in five languages around the world in 2021 despite each having at least 1 million people affected by conflict or climate disasters

The findings highlighted how the accelerating climate crisis is fuelling many of the worlds emergencies said Laurie Lee CEO of careintuk

There is deep injustice at the heart of it The worlds poorest are bearing the brunt of climate change  poverty migration hunger gender inequality and ever more scarce resources  despite having done the least to cause it he said Add Covid19 into the mix and we see decades of progress towards tackling inequality poverty conflict and hunger disappearing before our eyes

Lee highlighted the impact of the UKs 2021 foreign aid budget cuts saying that it resulted in over 166m less in humanitarian aid reaching the 10 countries mentioned in this report compared to 2019

According to Care International the humanitarian emergency in the African nation of Zambia recorded just 512 online articles from 1 January to 30 September 2021  while in the same timeframe the media published

This is the famous Kobe Bryant quote that has been inscribed on a new statue paying tribute to the basketball icon his daughter Gianna and the seven others killed in a helicopter crash two years ago

A fivetime NBA champion in his 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers Bryants death at age 41 shocked the world of sports and sent his legions of fans into mourning Gianna was 13 at the time of the crash which occurred as they were headed to a youth basketball tournament

Tributes to Bryant from friends fans and former teammates have poured in across social media today

I know many of you are out there and you miss him and still wish to see his brilliance on the court and what he was doing as a dad Lakers great Kareem AbdulJabbar said of Bryant who was the father of four girls and husband to Vanessa

I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines  potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation 

Thats what musician Neil Young wrote in an open letter demanding that his catalogue be removed from the streaming service because of his objections to false Covid claims made by podcaster Joe Rogan

In an open letter to his manager and record label that was posted to his website and later taken down Young said With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode The Joe Rogan Experience which is hosted exclusively on Spotify is the worlds largest podcast and has tremendous influence Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform though the company presently has no misinformation policy

Young added They can have Rogan or Young Not both

Rogan has been described by the New York Times as one of the most consumed media products on the planet In 2020 he signed a 100m deal that gave the streaming giant exclusive rights to his show which is Spotifys most popular

Since the pandemic Rogan who has legions of devoted followers has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims

A few weeks ago 270 doctors scientists healthcare professionals and professors wrote an open letter to Spotify expressing concern about medical misinformation on his podcast Specifically the letter called out a highly controversial episode of the podcast from last December about vaccines which has been widely criticised for promoting baseless conspiracy theories

On Wednesday a Spotify spokesperson confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that the platform was taking down Youngs music

We have detailed content policies in place and weve removed over 20000 podcast episodes related to Covid since the start of the pandemic We regret Neils decision to remove his music from Spotify but hope to welcome him back soon the spokesperson said

Were just thrilled to have her back home She is thriving  

After noticing Goldie the porcupine pufferfish was losing weight her owner rushed to the vet in Kent in the southeast of England

Medics at Sandhole Veterinary Centre in Snodland confirmed fiveyearold pufferfishs teeth were the problem they were too long for her to eat and needed to be filed down

So Goldie was sedated using a water bowl filled with a mild anaesthetic solution and a veterinary surgeon sawed down one inch from her teeth

To calm Goldie during the procedure the water was kept well oxygenated This meant she was still breathing nicely throughout but was able to be held for brief periods out of the water without becoming too stressed veterinary surgeon Daniel Calvo Carrasco said

Veterinary nurse Debbie Addison also held Goldie in a damp towel to prevent her from drying out  and provide a layer of protection if Goldies puff up defensive mode is activated When they feel threatened or distressed pufferfish can inflate to double their size to deter predators
 
Carrasco who specialises in caring for exotic pets said Porcupine pufferfish teeth are known as beaks and grow continuously throughout their lives  Theyre usually kept short naturally as theyre worn down on their regular diet of hardshelled foods but while these foods are provided in her home environment she is not as forthcoming in eating them as her other tank mates  As a result her upper beak grew to the point where it was hindering her ability to eat effectively

Goldie responded very well to the surgery there was no stress at all said Carrasco Within five minutes she was able to stay upright in the water and within 10 minutes she was back to happily swimming around

Goldie is now well settled back home in her tank in Leybourne much to the relief of her owner Mark Byatt who said Were just thrilled to have Goldie back home She is thriving back in her tank and none the worse for her visit to the dentist

Whats the factorial of 100

That would be the multiplication of 100 by every whole number less than it In other words 100 x 99 x 98 x 97 x 96 x  x 3 x 2 x 1

If you can figure out the answer you could be considered smarter than Google  or at least thats what Alex Bellos who has been setting a puzzle for the Guardian every two weeks since 2015 found out in the video above

Google Assistants answer was incorrect as it is rounded up

The answer is a big number but how many zeroes does the factorial of 100 really have at the end of it

All that is required to solve this puzzle is knowledge of elementary arithmetic Such as the fact that if a number has a 0 at the end it means this number is divisible by 10

Write what you think the answer is in the comment section below  and scroll down for the answer







The answer is 24 zeroes

I dont see any future for her 

After the collapse of the Afghan capital university student and NGO worker Amina says what followed was worse than she could imagine

She spoke to the Guardians Aamna Mohdin about her experience of being forced flee This is her story

I currently live in Pakistan with my family Before I left Afghanistan I was working for an NGO and I also studied business at university When the Taliban took over I had no certain future My education was not clear my school was closed

I was happy before the Taliban took over  I never thought that everything could vanish like that My sister is in grade 12 and supposed to graduate high school But after the collapse of Kabul we had no choice but to leave 

I dont see any future for her When I see her my tears come I cant control them She does not have any future and as a sister I cant do anything for her

We decided to leave Kabul a month ago when we saw the situation getting worse people are dying in the streets and their homes and theres no justice There is no certainty and no security We didnt know when or for what reason we would be killed

We left the country and we came here to Pakistan but the struggle is the same I dont see any future for myself or for my siblings But I am at least happy I saved my life and my familys I applied for the UK evacuation scheme because of my work and my other sister is an artist and journalist But still we have not heard anything specific from them 

I wish I could explain the difficulties we go through We dont have a place to live everything is more expensive and people live on the street and you dont know the language My siblings dont have any access to school It is like being imprisoned in a house in a room

I wish I could tell the UK government theres so many other people who are waiting for a better future or so many other people who are displaced I wish I could show them the pain and the uncertainty We dont have any other options We cant go back to our country but we cant continue to live here

It doesnt look like your usual protest but this is how the Netherlands staged a national demonstration against lockdown measures which allowed gyms and beauty salons to open but not cultural venues

Dozens of famous theatres and galleries welcomed hairdressers and beauticians whilst also hosting performances

After nearly two years of uncertainty performers and musicians need perspective said Dominik Winterling the new managing director of the Concertgebouw

We simply dont know whats going on  what we really want is to play for an audience because thats what were there for We want to inspire people Thats what its about

In a Twitter post junior culture minister Gunay Uslu voiced understanding for the protest but urged caution

The cultural sector is drawing attention to their situation in a creative way I understand the cry for help and that artists want to show all the beautiful things they have to offer us But the opening of society must go step by step Culture is high on the agenda

In the Netherlands new covid infections have been hitting neardaily records above 30000 The country has recorded more than 35 million infections and 21000 deaths since the start of the pandemic Hospital numbers have been steadily declining

Lisala Folaus story has become one of the first to emerge from Tonga five days after a devastating tsunami cut off communications between the island nation and the rest of the world

Folau a retired carpenter said he had been painting his home on Saturday when he was alerted about the tsunami

He told Tongan radio station Broadcom FM he drifted and swam from his island of Atata via two other uninhabited islands for more than 24 hours to eventually reach the main island of Tongatapu a total distance of around 13 kilometres

My elder brother and a nephew came to my assistance this time the wave has gone through our lounge we moved to another part of the house when a bigger wave this wave I would estimate was about not less than six metres arrived

Bear in mind that I am disabled I cant walk properly  and when I can I believe a baby can walk faster than I he added

He said they climbed a tree with his niece while his brother ran to seek help When there was a lull in the waves they climbed down but just then a larger wave hit

We floated at sea just calling out to each other It was dark and we could not see each other Very soon I could not hear my niece calling anymore but I could hear my son calling

Folau said that in that moment he decided not to answer his son for fear that he would risk his life to save him

The truth is no son can abandon his father But for me as a father I kept my silence for if I answered him he would jump in and try to rescue me But I understand the tough situation and I thought if the worst comes and it is only me

Folau said he figured that if he clung to a tree trunk his family would at least be able to find his body if he died

The Guardian has not been able to establish what happened to Folaus son and the niece he was with in Atata However only three people have been confirmed to have died following the tsunami none from Atata

When Dr Prit Buttar a retired GP decided to break social distancing rules and offer his embrace to a bereaved woman it was a gesture of core humanity

Everybody on the team would have done exactly the same Covid or no Covid he says

He did not envisage a year on that his recollection of that moment would inspire a cathartic outpouring of similar memories from people on social media

Or that he would become a reluctant  though passionate  advocate for the fury and dismay of ordinary people at the boozy rulebreaking in the seat of power

Thats how much Elon Musk the founder of Tesla and the worlds other nine richest billionaires have collectively grown wealthier by since the start of the pandemic while the incomes of 99 of the global population reduced

Thats according to a new report from Oxfam which suggests that the 10 richest men on the planet have seen their net worth more than double to 15tn 101tn from March 2020 to October 2021

The study found that a surge in share and property prices has widened the gap between rich and poor estimating that 33 billion people will be living on less than 550 per day by 2030

The charity said World Bank figures showed 163 million more people had been driven below the poverty line while the superrich were benefiting from the stimulus provided by governments around the world to mitigate the impact of the virus

They have urged governments to impose a oneoff windfall tax of 99 on the value of the increase in the wealth of these top 10 individuals which Oxfam say could pay for enough jabs to vaccinate the entire world and provide the resources to tackle the climate crisis provide universal healthcare and social protection and address genderbased violence in 80 countries

Even after this 99 levy the top 10 billionaires would be 8bn better off between them than they were before the pandemic the charity added

Musk according to figures taken from Forbes magazines billionaires list saw his wealth increase 10fold to 294bn in the first 20 months of the pandemic catapulting him above Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon to be the worlds richest person

Danny Sriskandarajah the Oxfam GB chief executive said Even during a global crisis our unfair economic systems manage to deliver eyewatering windfalls for the wealthiest but fail to protect the poorest It is an avoidable tragedy that every day people die because they lack essentials such as food and healthcare

Todays generation of leaders can start to right these wrongs by implementing progressive taxes on capital and wealth and deploying that revenue to save lives and invest in our future

Martin Luther King Jrs 13yearold granddaughter Yolanda Renee King has issued a stark warning to Democratic lawmakers who have been accused of stalling new voting rights legislation that aims to protect voters from racial discrimination

Vicepresident Kamala Harris has said that the right to vote in the US was under assault and tens of millions of Americans faced potential disenfranchisement unless threatened voting rights legislation was passed

Activists want politicians to pass two measures aimed at expanding voting rights across the country  the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act

This is seen as crucial in the face of a wave of Republican state legislation that is aimed at erecting barriers to voting that is likely to suppress the votes of communities of color

But two Democrats senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have remained opposed to changing filibuster rules which are necessary to move the bills through

In a statement last week King III spoke of his father who would have turned 93 on Saturday and said that the stakes could not be higher to protect and expand his fathers legacy of activism and racial justice

Speaking on the public holiday MLK day yesterday this was Yolanda Renee Kings message to lawmakers Do not celebrate Legislate

So why exactly are US voting rights under threat  and how is the filibuster related Click the link in bio to read more

Sections of the bill have been condemned by human rights activists as a vitriolic attack on the right to protest freedoms to show dissatisfaction or to call for change

The bills antiprotest measures grant police and the home secretary currently Priti Patel the power to ban marches and demonstrations that they consider to be seriously disruptive including those deemed too noisy

Other controversial elements of the bill include tougher consequences for those who do attend banned protests including
 10 years in prison for damaging memorials or statues
 12 months in prison for obstructing roads railways airports oil refineries and printing presses
 51 weeks in prison for attaching yourself onto another personobject
 Banning individuals from participating in demonstrations or even using the internet to encourage others to do so

Ahead of the House of Lords debating the proposals today we spoke to activist amikageorge who founded the freeperiods campaign and Guardian reporter damiengayle about what is behind the UK government crackdown and what it could mean for protesting

What are your thoughts on the new policing bill

A huge underwater volcano eruption in Tonga sent a huge plume of ash steam and gas rising from the ocean as seen in these satellite images

People were forced to flee their homes as tsunami waves crashed into the main island of Tongatapu following the eruption of the HungaTonga HungaHaapai volcano on Saturday

The tsunami waves reportedly caused damage to boats as far away as Hawaii and New Zealand and large swells were seen in California and Japan but did not appear to cause any widespread damage Two people have drowned off a beach in northern Peru local authorities say after unusually high waves were recorded in several coastal areas

On Tonga home to about 105000 people video posted on social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas swirling around homes and buildings including a church

What I earned in a month with drugs I earned in six months cleaning houses says Paola pictured on the sixth slide

She is one of the 22000 women in Argentina convicted for drug offences

Across the country 43 of female prisoners are serving time for drug possession according to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights

It is by far the leading cause of imprisonment for women As a comparison the second leading cause  theft  represents only 9 of convictions

This represents a pattern developing across Latin America aggressive drug policies that are filling the regions prisons with women many of whom are forced into the drug business because they have no other alternatives to support their families

These women are the most visible  and the most exposed  face of the regions drug trade

Paola says she left her home when she was 13 to escape abuse and violence  and lived on the streets for five years until she became pregnant Her boyfriend left her when he found out Without work and food Paola agreed to deal drugs for a neighbourhood kingpin

Dementia presents a major and rapidly growing threat to future health and social care systems in every community country and continent

Thats according to experts who have revealed shocking data from the first study of its kind providing forecasting estimates for adults aged 40 and older across 195 countries worldwide

The Global Burden of Disease study estimates the number of adults living with dementia globally is on course to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050

US researchers said the dramatic rise from an estimated 57 million cases in 2019 would be primarily due to population growth and ageing However several risk factors for dementia  including obesity smoking and high blood sugar  would also fuel the increase they said

Improvements in global education access are projected to reduce global dementia prevalence by 62 million cases by 2050 But this will be countered by anticipated trends in obesity high blood sugar and smoking which are expected to result in an extra 68 million dementia cases

Dementia cases will rise in every country with the largest growth in north Africa and the Middle East 367 and eastern subSaharan Africa 357 according to experts The smallest estimated increases are in the highincome Asia Pacific 53 and western Europe 74 the study suggests

Dementia is already one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally with costs in 2019 estimated at more than 1tn 750bn Although dementia mainly affects older people it is not an inevitable consequence of ageing

The researchers behind the new study called for more aggressive prevention efforts to reduce dementia risk through lifestyle factors like education diet and exercise alongside research to discover effective diseasemodifying treatments and new modifiable risk factors to reduce the future burden of disease

But they also acknowledged their analysis was limited by a lack of highquality data in several parts of the world and by studies using different methodologies and definitions of dementia

Novak Djokovics Australian visa has again been cancelled just days before the start of the Australian Open

The Australian immigration minister Alex Hawke exercised a personal power to cancel Djokovics visa likely to result in the world No 1s deportation and putting him out of contention for the grand slam tournament barring an againsttheodds court victory

The decision means that Djokovic could be effectively barred from reentering Australia for three years unless he can show in future bids that compelling circumstances exist such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds

Djokovic will attend an interview with immigration officials on Saturday after which he can choose to leave Australia or appeal the decision In a statement Hawke said he cancelled the visa on health and good order grounds and on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so

The decision to cancel the visa likely leaves the Australian Open without one of its biggest stars and Djokovic  who was seeking a recordbreaking 21st grand slam triumph  unable to defend the title he has won nine times

Heres a recap of how Djokovics visa controversy has unfolded so far

Seeing one in real life is indescribable

This is the moment marine biologist Jacinta Shackleton spotted a dazzling blanket octopus in the wild off the coast of Lady Elliot Island in the Great Barrier Reef

The technicolour marine mollusc has only been seen a handful of times in the wild making it one of the rarest sights in the marine world

When I first saw it I thought it could have been a juvenile fish with long fins but as it came closer I realised it was a female blanket octopus and I had this overwhelming sense of joy and excitement Shackleton said

I kept yelling through my snorkel its a blanket octopus I was so excited I was finding it difficult to hold my breath to dive down and video it

Blanket octopuses are extremely rare The first sighting of a live male was made 21 years ago just north of the Great Barrier Reef

While females grow up to 2 metres in length the males have only been seen to grow to about 24cm long

Males also dont develop the blanket octopuss iridescent blanket that makes the species so alluring For the females that do develop it the display can be shed to elude predators

The extreme difference between the sexes is thought to have developed because of the blanket octopuss unique habit of carrying bluebottle stingers for selfdefence

Seeing one in real life is indescribable I was so captivated by its movements it was as if it was dancing through the water with a flowing cape The vibrant colours are just so incredible you cant take your eyes off it

Ive truly never seen anything like it before and dont think I ever will again in my life

Living in a flammable flat is giving my three daughters nightmares 

Lucy Brown lives with her husband and children in east London and two years ago she was told her building has flammable Grenfellstyle cladding 

Its taken an emotional and financial toll on Lucy whos struggled to sleep since finding out her home is unsafe 

The family are worried about a fire breaking out and as a precaution they run fire drills with the children and have taught them what to do in the case of a fire 

Five years after the Grenfell Tower fire  which killed 72 people  hundreds of thousands of people continue to live in unsafe buildings in the UK 

Earlier this week the UK government announced a longawaited pledge to help cladding victims 

New legislation would require the building developers and manufacturers who created the Grenfellstyle cladding to cover the full cost required to make buildings safe again 

Lucy and many others who are living with cladding still feel uncertain about whether this pledge will cover the full cost it takes to make their homes safe

A lot of pictures of homeless people are really sad I didnt want to do that There is some joy in these people and thats what I wanted to show

New York photographer billbernstein says he was feeling helpless about the citys problem with homelessness  and he wanted to do something to bring a little attention to the issue

Bernstein used to help serve dinner at the Bowery Mission a Christian rescue centre around Thanksgiving and Christmas time  and asked organisers if he could do some portraits of their regular users

He says I was interested when couples arrived at the centre as it was clear that they lived together on the streets These guys were such a great pair When they smiled I was like thats the picture

My plan was to focus on faces and eyes because we so often walk down the street and see somebody and we dont want to actually look at them or engage

Bernstein says he wanted to capture the togetherness of the couple and to give a sense of what their relationship felt like

I think they felt really special having all the lights and cameras and attention on them when doing this project I hope that feeling lasted for a while

If you find yourself holding a Maya Angelou quarter may you be reminded of her words be certain that you do not die without having done something wonderful for humanity

The late poet and activist Maya Angelou has become the first Black woman ever to appear on a US quarter after a coin featuring her image went into circulation on Monday

With her arms uplifted a bird in flight and a rising sun behind her the US Mint said the image pictured on the second slide was inspired by her poetry and symbolic of the way she lived A portrait of George Washington appears on the heads side 

The poet and writer who died in 2014 was the author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings in which she wrote about the racial discrimination she experienced growing up 

The author of 36 books  and the recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees  she read her poem On the Pulse of the Morning at Bill Clintons 1992 inauguration and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010

The Angelou quarter is the first in the US Mints American Women Quarters programme which will include the physicist and first female astronaut Dr Sally Ride and Wilma Mankiller the first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation later this year The American public was invited to submit names of iconic women for the programme after a bill put forward by Democrat congresswoman Barbara Lee

I am proud to have led this effort to honour these phenomenal women who more often than not are overlooked in our countrys telling of history said Lee

Do you remember what you were doing in May 2020

Boris Johnson has been accused of an utterly outrageous breach of lockdown rules again  as a leaked email showed one of his top officials invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a bring your own booze party during the first lockdown The police are now investigating

The British prime minister is believed to have attended the No 10 garden party on 20 May 2020 along with Carrie Johnson then his fiancee after it was advertised by his principal private secretary Martin Reynolds

Hi all after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze the email seen by ITV News said

It invited just over 100 employees to the gathering at a time when social mixing was banned except with one other person from another household outdoors in a public place

The party came five days after a 15 May 2020 wine and pizza party in Downing Street in the garden and inside No 10 reported by the Guardian in December with staff drinking late into the evening

Johnson will now come under huge pressure to explain his own role in the gathering whether he played any part in the invitation given the phrase we thought it would be nice and why his office did not listen to alleged warnings from his former aide Dominic Cummings that it appeared to be against the rules Cummings revealed the existence of the 20 May party in a blog on Friday

Johnsons spokesperson declined to comment in light of a continuing inquiry into potential breaches of lockdown in Downing Street No 10 did not deny this weekend that Johnson and his wife Carrie whom he married in May 2021 attended the event

The photographs of an infant boy handed in desperation to a US soldier over the wall at Kabul airport became one of the defining images of the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan

The baby Sohail Ahmadi was just two months old when he went missing on 19 August as thousands of people rushed to leave the country as it fell to the Taliban

Sohail has now been found and reunited with his relatives

Following a Reuters story published in November with his pictures he was located in Kabul where a taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him alone and crying on the ground at the airport

After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the babys parents inside he decided to take the infant home to his wife and children

During the tumultuous Afghan evacuation Mirza Ali Ahmadi  the boys father who had worked as a security guard at the US embassy  and his wife Suraya feared their son would be crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates

He said in early November that in his desperation that day he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining five metres to the entrance to reclaim him At that moment Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and by the time Ahmadi his wife and their four other children were able to get inside Sohail was nowhere to be found

Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later The family was evacuated to America

With no US embassy in Afghanistan and international organisations overstretched Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing or possibility of complex reunifications like this one

After more than seven weeks of negotiations Safi handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives on Saturday

Sohails parents said they were overjoyed to see the reunion over video chat  and their son will soon be brought to the US

Who keeps the dog after divorce

That is something the Spanish courts will now decide under a new law that considers a pets welfare when couples divorce or breakup

The legal shift comes after similar moves in France and Portugal and obliges judges to consider pets as sentient beings rather than objects or property owned by one or the other partner  something that is still in place in most countries

Animals are part of the family and when a family decides to separate the fate of the animal must be regulated with the same importance as the fate of other family members said lawyer Lola Garcia 42

In October a Madrid judge gave joint custody of a dog to an unmarried couple who sought a court ruling on whom the pet should stay with after they separated The dog spends a month with each of them and both are legally responsible

Previously a lawyer seeking joint custody of a pet had to prove both members of a couple owned the animal as an object giving whoever had registered the pet an advantage

Garcia whose RightsAnimals firm handled the case considers the reform a major first step in a series of forthcoming legal changes governing peoples relationship with animals

Now a judge has to determine where the animal will fare better and that determination is based on the animals wellbeing Garcia explained

A partner that can demonstrate financial solvency or who has been granted custody of their children has a better chance of securing custody of any pets too as there is a special affective link between children and animals she added

We have lost an icon A hero a mentor a fighter a national treasure

Sidney Poitier whose pioneering acting work in the 1950s and 60s paved the way for generations of black film stars has died aged 94

Poitier was the first Black person to win a best actor Oscar for his role in Lilies of the Field  and gave a string of groundbreaking performances on screen that helped combat social prejudice

His death was announced on Friday by the minister of foreign affairs of the Bahamas Fred Mitchell The countrys deputy prime minister Chester Cooper said he was conflicted with great sadness and a sense of celebration when I learned of the passing of Sir Sidney Poitier

He added Sadness that he would no longer be here to tell him how much he means to us but celebration that he did so much to show the world that those from the humblest beginnings can change the world and that we gave him his flowers while he was with us

We have lost an icon A hero a mentor a fighter a national treasure

Born to Bahamian parents while they were visiting Miami to sell tomatoes in 1927 Poitier grew up in the Bahamas  then a British colony  before returning to the US aged 15 and working at a series of lowpaid jobs before briefly serving in the army during the second world war and attempting to feign insanity to win a medical discharge

But how did he go on to become a film star who quietly pioneered a revolution Click the link in bio to read more

By the time you are reading this the bosses of Britains biggest companies have made more money than the average UK worker will in the entire year according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else in the country

The High Pay Centre a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers said that by 9am on Friday the fourth working day of 2022 a FTSE 100 chief executive will have been paid more on an hourly basis than the UK workers annual salary based on median average remuneration figures for both groups

FTSE 100 chief executives were paid 27m on average in 2020 which are the latest fullyear figures available This works out at 86 times the 31285 average salary for fulltime UK workers according to Office for National Statistics figures

Most FTSE 100 companies have not yet announced CEO pay for their financial year ending in 2021 but 57 of those that have done so have recorded an increase on 2020 levels the High Pay Centre report said

Gary Smith the general secretary of the GMB union which represents 600000 workers said the figures showed that bosses were paid 173 times the amount collected by carers who risked their lives on the frontline of the pandemic

Just a normal day in Washington 

Thats how some Republicans have been portraying the Capitol attack which happened one year ago today

In their attempts to downplay what happened theyve called the rioters peaceful protesters and even likened the attack to a normal tourist visit and one day in January

But the reality couldnt be more different Five people died scores of police were beaten and bloodied and there was about 15m in damage in the first major attack on the Capitol since the war of 1812 More than 700 people have subsequently been charged in one of the biggest criminal investigations in American history

Not all Republicans agree however and few have been as publicly vocal as senator Mitt Romney What happened was a violent effort to interfere with and prevent the constitutional order of installing a new president he said in May

Michael Steele the former chairman of the Republican National Committee also sees the riot in a different light to some of his colleagues They have to rewrite the history because thats the only way they can justify their existence he told the Guardian Because if you let the actual facts of history speak to the truth of who they are then I dont know how they look themselves in the face in the morning
Violent clashes in Kazahkstan are developing and the president KassymJomart Tokayev has called on a Russialed military alliance to provide peacekeeping troops to help him regain control

The protests began in the west of the country at the weekend after a sharp rise in fuel prices but have spread quickly and taken authorities and international observers by surprise

It all started with the increase in gas prices but the real cause of the protests is poor living conditions of people high prices joblessness corruption said 55yearold Zauresh Shekenova who has been demonstrating since Sunday

With a mobile reception and internet blackout across much of the country reliable figures on casualties are hard to come by but there have been reports that dozens of people were killed during attacks on government buildings on Wednesda There have also been reports of shooting in Almaty the countrys commercial capital and other cities

Tokayev has promised a ruthless crackdown and blamed terrorists trained abroad for the unrest

So what exactly are the protesters angry about What are their demands And what happens next Tap the link in bio to read more

Preet Chandi thought to be the first woman of colour to complete a solo crossing on Antarctica has finished her expedition to the south pole almost a week ahead of schedule

Chandi or Polar Preet endured temperatures of 50C as she skied 700 miles across Antarctica in 40 days seven hours and three minutes narrowly missing out on setting a new world record by a woman for the trek

She finished just behind the time set by Johanna Davidsson of Sweden who finished in 38 days 23 hours and five minutes in 2016

Chandi 32 is now the thirdfastest female solo skier for the expedition behind Davidsson and Britains Hannah McKeand who recorded a time of 39 days nine hours and 33 minutes in 2006

She is also the first person to reach the south pole on foot in two years

Chandi a British Army physiotherapist who lives in Derby said she hoped her journey would inspire young people women and those from minorityethnic backgrounds Speaking to the Guardian during her training for the trek she said people did not expect an Asian woman to attempt such an endeavour

I am an Asian woman Im not the image that people expect to see out there she said People say the outdoors is for everyone and yes it is But if you come from a community that is not involved in it at all or you dont see anybody that looks like you doing it it can be really hard

After completing the trek she plans to set up an adventure grant to help more women fund expeditions in what is often a maledominated arena

I have been told no on many occasions and to just do the normal thing but we create our own normal she said You are capable of anything you want
Frances president Emmanuel Macron has vowed to make daily life more and more difficult for people who have yet to take the Covid vaccine

I am not about pissing off the French people the president said in an interview with readers of Le Parisien daily on Tuesday But as for the nonvaccinated I really want to piss them off And we will continue to do this to the end This is the strategy

Macrons remarks came as the French parliament debated new legislation that if passed will mean only the fully vaccinated and no longer those with a negative Covid test will qualify for the countrys health pass from next month

The pass introduced this summer is required in France for access to indoor public places such as cafes restaurants cinemas museums concert venues and sports centres as well as to board longdistance trains and planes

France has vaccinated almost 90 of its population who are eligible Macron said and it was only a very small minority who are resisting

But his comments have sparked a furore among his political opponents who accused the president of excessive language

The vaccine pass has been criticised by both rightwing and radical left parties as a collective punishment against individual liberties

Polls show a large majority of French voters are growing increasingly frustrated with the pandemic and back the vaccine pass as an effective means to end it they said  and of those who oppose it very few are likely to cast their ballot for Macron

Elizabeth Holmes founder of the blood testing company Theranos has been found guilty on four charges of fraud  a verdict that will probably land her in prison and have major implications for Silicon Valley

Theranos sold a promise to improve health with tests on one drop of blood  a claim that despite having little scientific proof raised hundreds of millions of dollars and attracted bigname investors such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger

Holmes once the worlds youngest female selfmade billionaire was acquitted on three charges relating to patients who received inaccurate test results but found guilty on four charges including one count of conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud against investors Holmes is expected to appeal The jury remained deadlocked on three of the charges 

The split verdicts are a mixed bag for the prosecution but its a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years said David Ring a lawyer who has followed the case closely

It also marks a milestone for Silicon Valley  an industry that has for years evaded accountability in its pervasive culture of fake it til you make it that encourages founders to make big promises often with little proof

Have you ever heard of Pictorialism

It is an approach to photography that emphasises beauty of subject matter tonality and composition rather than the documentation of reality

During the second world war troves of works by west coast pictorialists were lost In the aftermath of the the surprise attack by Japan on the US naval base at Pearl Harbour in 1941 the lives of innumerable Japanese Americans were upended  under the Enemy Alien Act cameras were considered contraband when found in their possession

Because of the tremendous loss of material and documentation from the era the contributions of Japanese Americans to the development of art photography in the US were vastly underestimated in early histories

But a new exhibition shows just how influential they were  and how these photographers helped lay the groundwork for moody urban pictures

How old do you think children should be when their parent starts talking to them about porn and sexual harassment

According to the childrens commissioner for England it should be when they are as young as nine or 10  and ideally before they have a smartphone or social media account

It comes after billieeilish revealed last month the devastating impact watching porn from an early age had on her The Grammywinning singer said she started at 11 and developed an addiction that gave her nightmares and made dating difficult

Concern has only been growing about the ease of access to and damaging impact of online pornography on young children who often browse the internet unsupervised and are exposed to material that shows degradation and violence towards women

And the childrens commissioners guide has highlighted the gap between what parents think and their childrens reality Only a quarter of parents think their child has seen pornography online but in reality more than half of 11 to 13yearolds have already seen porn many came across it by accident and 62 say their viewing of porn is mostly unintentional

Swipe through to see what exactly the seven types of rest are

Which tip do you think would work best for you

rest relaxation sleep fatigue
Which loo with a view is your number one  or number two

Be it the crest of an icy mountain peak the depths of the dense native bush or the slopes of sleeping volcanoes New Zealands wild and remote landscapes are coveted by outdoor enthusiasts the world over

But what really sets the countrys nature apart from the rest is what is at ones disposal when nature calls  spectacular loos with views

These scenic spots  small remote and lacking in plumbing  are a curious quirk in New Zealands landscape and offer up some of the best panoramas in the country

The department of conservation is responsible for the extensive network of landscape latrines and holds the unusual gong of managing more toilets than any other organisation in New Zealand

Many of the impressive longdrops are linked to some of the 970 huts dotted through the more remote and striking parts of the country and require helicopters to fly the waste out

The department says it is looking at ways of reducing helicopter flying to reduce cost and carbon emissions

The oldest toilet is believed to be a 90yearold pit toilet at an old farm homestead now managed by the department as part of Rakiura national park called Island Hill Run on RakiuraStewart Island

The toilet with the most impressive altitude is at Empress Hut 2500m up New Zealands highest mountain AorakiMt Cook in the Southern Alps

So if youre bogged down with your mediocre toilet views head to New Zealand for the best seat in the house  if youre ready to take the plunge

Staunton who has appeared in productions of Sondheims classic musicals Into the Woods Sweeney Todd and Gypsy places him in theatre history as the last of the big boys the final link with the great American songbook a man with personal connections to Oscar Hammerstein and Leonard Bernstein

She came to know him as a friend and remembers his generosity with actors directors and producers and how he always had time for younger cast members

He never made you feel inadequate she says He only ever wanted all of us to be our very best She also explains the great gift in his work to a performer His work is not about how the songs sound Its how they feel He wrote monologues and then in the music he gave you the rhythm and the heartbeat of each one

Archbishop Desmond Tutu Nobel peace prize laureate and veteran of South Africas struggle against white minority rule has died aged 90

Tutu described by foreign observers and his countrymen as the moral conscience of his nation passed away in Cape Town on Boxing Day

The passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nations farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa president Cyril Ramaphosa said

Tutu was born in October 1931 and ordained an Anglican priest in 1961 He was thrust into the limelight in 1978 when he was appointed secretarygeneral of the South African Council of Churches

Excitable emotional charismatic and highly articulate Tutu won the Nobel peace prize in 1984 A vocal supporter of sanctions against South Africa he was detested by supporters of the apartheid regime who saw him as an agitator and traitor

Tutu was however protected not just by his wit and combative spirit but by his immense popularity and respect In 1986 he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town the effective head of the Anglican church in his homeland

After the nations first free election in 1994 Nelson Mandela who had become the president of a free South Africa asked Tutu to chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission TRC the controversial and emotional hearings into apartheidera human rights abuses

Sometimes strident often tender never afraid and seldom without humour Desmond Tutus voice will always be the voice of the voiceless is how Mandela who died in December 2013 described his friend

Tutu who retired from most public duties in October 2010 is still seen as a voice of integrity The Arch as he is affectionately known will be remembered as one of the leading lights of the struggle against apartheid who was not afraid to condemn injustice wherever he saw it

For our series paying tribute to cultural figures who passed away in 2021 Otis Williams founder of the Temptations remembers his fiercely determined Motown colleague Mary Wilson who lit up the stage with the Supremes and fought for artists rights

Our careers went in parallel in many aspects and that bonded us as friends he says Our bands were known together as Motowns nohit wonders  neither of us had a hit until late 1963 which was hard

But Mary had a lot of determination Shed throw everything into her performances Wed sing in nightclubs together and Id watch her from the side of the stage notice how hard she was working

When Diana Ross left the band Wilson fought to keep copyright of the Supremes name and went on to help draft the historic Truth In Music bill protecting the trademark of a band name for original members

Wilson kept working on music until her death Williams spoke to her just a few weeks before he heard she had gone She said to me Im still your Mary I know she loved being part of Motown singing those songs that will outlive us all

This year was another extraordinary period for news and investigations

In our 200th anniversary year twelve months of Covid stories ranged from the hope of vaccination through to government sleaze

It was also the year of Cop26 with activists and world leaders gathering in an attempt to slow the climate crisis There were protests against injustice including those about violence against women It was also a year of global political shifts not least in Afghanistan

Meanwhile it was a year of sporting inspiration at the Euros the Olympics and with emmaraducanus improbable US Open triumph

As we look back on 2021 this image stays so prominently in our minds

It shows Ndakasi an orphaned mountain gorilla living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo lying in the arms of her caregiver Andre Bauma taking her final breath She died aged 14 in September after a prolonged illness

Ndakasi was just two months old when rangers found her clinging to the lifeless body of her mother who had been gunned down by armed militia in 2007 Bauma comforted her that first night by holding her to his bare chest and had continued caring for her since then

This hauntingly powerful image reminds us of what our relationship with animals can be  and how significant these are

Ndakasi who famously posed in the background of a selfie taken by rangers at Virunga national park was transferred to the Senkwekwe Center after its creation in 2009 and lived with other orphaned mountain gorillas viewed as too vulnerable to return to the wild

A number of the orphans here were rescued from sales by poachers in sting operations carried out by Congolese National Park Authority ICCN rangers

Virunga national park in eastern DRC is home to some of the worlds last mountain gorillas Neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda are also home to mountain gorillas and together their population has recently risen to more than 1000

Nearly 700 rangers in Virunga park risk their lives to protect its wildlife in a region that has faced more than two decades of armed conflict and instability

Mr Bauma and others at the Senkwekwe Center had cared for Ndakasi and other orphans for 13 years This is the only mountain gorilla orphanage in the world and takes in mountain gorilla orphans who have lost their families to poaching or conflict

It was a privilege to support and care for such a loving creature Bauma said in a statement when this image was released in October

It was Ndakasis sweet nature and intelligence that helped me to understand the connection between humans and great apes and why we should do everything in our power to protect them

Bauma said he was proud to have called Ndakasi a friend

Have you struggled with the lack of daylight in the past few months

Yesterday marked the winter solstice in the UK and the rest of the northern hemisphere which is the shortest period of daylight in the year and the first official day of winter

That means from today the amount of daylight we get each day will keep increasing until we reach the summer solstice on 21 June next year

The situation is the reverse in the Southern Hemisphere There the December solstice marks the longest day of the year  and the beginning of summer in places such as Australia Chile and South Africa

Many people dread winter because of the darkness it brings with it and the resulting seasonal depression known as seasonal affective disorder SAD

One in three people suffer from SAD in the UK according to a 2014 study Most people start to get symptoms for the first time in their 20s or 30s and women are about four times more likely to have SAD than men

SAD is a huge problem at the best of times and this is not the best of times said Norman Rosenthal the doctor who named the disorder after research inspired by the effects of winter on his own mood

He is concerned that people already suffering from the effects of a pandemic that has had a dire effect on mental health might have found their unhappiness amplified during the darker days of winter

Ancient peoples whose survival depended on a precise knowledge of seasonal cycles marked the winter solstice with ceremonies and celebrations

The UKs most famous site for solstice celebrations is Stonehenge On the winter solstice visitors traditionally have been able to enter the mysterious stone circle for a sunrise ceremony run by local pagan and druid groups

There are the physical scars bruises abrasions fractures But also the psychological scars traumas

Polish photographer Jdrzej Nowicki has worked to capture both in his project The Scars a record of what is now known as the largest antigovernment unrest in the history of Belarus

Huge protests started in August 2020 and left deep traces on Belarusian society The president Alexander Lukashenko and his state apparatus responded with extreme brutality to the Belarusian resistance

What is now happening in the country will also leave deep scars in the social fabric A division into two Belarusian states is already emerging

The protagonists of these photos are protesters beaten by the regime families whose relatives have been tortured by the security services or citizens who oppose violence and want freedom But also soldiers dragged into the middle of a conflict that was never theirs

The UK Canada Germany and other EU states have supported a deliberate policy to withhold vaccines from the poorest countries in the world and defended an immoral and unethical economic system which places big pharma patents ahead of millions of lives writes former director at the World Health Organization Anthony Costello

Millions more people will die from Covid19 in the coming year and most will be unvaccinated The vaccines that could save millions of lives are not reaching the poor majority of the worlds population

The contrast is stark the current share of people fully vaccinated in high uppermiddle income lowermiddle income and low income countries is 69 68 30 and 35 respectively

This map shows the huge inequality in the rollout of Covid19 vaccines across the globe It shows the number of doses administered per 100 people over time until 8 December this year

Vaccines help stem transmission and reduce the number of host bodies available for further mutations to take place Being a very globalised planet with people travelling from around the world all the time only vaccinating certain countries is a roll of the dice again and again on variants as Omicron makes clear

It didnt have to be this way Around 12bn doses are forecast to be produced by the end of this year Had a principle of vaccine equity governed the global rollout this could have comfortably vaccinated every adult in the world

You cant help but feel exploited 

The actor Claire Foy has revealed how she struggled with filming the sex scenes for the latest adaptation of A Very British Scandal in which she stars as a duchess whose private life became the subject of salacious gossip during her divorce proceedings

Its a really hard line because basically you do feel exploited when you are a woman and you are having to perform fake sex on screen You cant help but feel exploited

Its grim  its the grimmest thing you can do You feel exposed Everyone can make you try to not feel that way but its unfortunately the reality

But my thing was that I felt very strongly that it had to be in it but I wanted it to be female I did not want it be that sort of awful climactic sexual experience you often see on the cinema screen she told BBC Radio 4s Womans Hour

Foy plays Margaret Campbell the Duchess of Argyll who was famed for her charisma beauty and style and who suffered the publication of explicit photographs after her husband sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery

The 1963 hearing focused heavily on the duchesss sex life with her husband Ian Campbell publicly estimating the number of men with whom he believed she had had sex as well as providing explicit pictures purporting to show her in the act

The duchess was criticised by the judge who denounced her in his judgment as a highly sexed woman The fact that the couple had an open marriage her husband had also exploited and that he had stolen her private property and reportedly sought the divorce only when she stopped paying his bills was deemed largely irrelevant

Responding to the suggestion that the duchess was the first woman to be publicly slutshamed by the media Foy dismissed the term 

She said I hate the phrase slutshaming I absolutely hate it But I think that women have basically been slutshamed forever I think Eve was probably slutshamed

Wanted someone with experience running a pub a love of isolation and a willingness to mark their appointment by sitting on a throne and having beer poured over their head

A council has begun one of the UKs most unusual local government recruitment processes while looking for someone to run the Ship Inn on Piel Island off the coast near BarrowinFurness in the Northwest of England

Whoever is in charge of the pub is crowned King of Piel in a ceremony involving a rusty sabre which concludes with buckets of beer being poured over their head Any punter who unwittingly sits on the throne has to buy drinks for everyone

Barrow borough council is seeking to a recruit a landlord on a 10year lease in time for the season starting in April As well as running the pub the successful applicant will need to manage and maintain the island itself

Many people go to the island for birthday parties or for a few drinks before camping overnight

John Murphy has been leading walks to the island for nearly 40 years and says whoever gets the job will need to be massively dedicated

You cant just nip across to Tesco for a loaf of bread when youre on Piel Island he said Youll need to have dedication and a strong passion for isolation and peace and quiet It takes a special personality

Murphy would love the job himself but at 73 says he is too old He has handed the job of leading walks to the island to younger legs but he still intends to be on Piel telling its stories

I absolutely adore Piel Island I adore its isolation I also love the fact that Barrow still is an industrial town and yet we have this gorgeous isolated island within spitting distance

Four months ago 35yearold Gabriel Boric confounded the polls to claim victory in a presidential primary he had barely been old enough to compete in 

But on 11 March next year he will now be sworn in as Chiles youngest ever president  having amassed more votes than any presidential candidate in history

Boric is the driving force behind Chiles abrupt changing of the guard He belongs to a radical generation of student leaders who are grimly determined to bury dictator Augusto Pinochets bitter legacy once and for all

Chile was the birthplace of neoliberalism and it shall also be its grave he shouted from a stage the night of his primary win his forearm tattoo peeking out from beneath a rolledup sleeve

Neoliberalism sees competition as the defining characteristic of human relations It redefines citizens as consumers whose democratic choices are best exercised by buying and selling a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency It maintains that the market delivers benefits that could never be achieved by planning

Boric said his generation wanted to have its rights respected and not be treated like consumer goods or a business adding the country would no longer allow Chiles poor to keep paying the price of inequality

So who exactly is Gabriel Boric  and how did he beat his ultraconservative farright opponent Jos Antonio Kast Tap the link in bio to read more

At first glance it has all the hallmarks of a laidback postwork social gathering on an uncommonly warm British spring evening

But there is a lot more to this image

Boris Johnson was pictured with wine and cheese alongside his thenfianc Carrie who appears to be holding their newborn baby and up to 17 staff in the Downing Street garden on 15 May 2020 during lockdown

The photo was shared with the Guardian after No 10s denial last week that there was a social event on that day which included wine spirits and pizza inside and outside the building

Johnsons spokesperson said Downing Street staff were working in the garden in the afternoon and evening

However the picture raises questions over that assertion Bottles of wine are in evidence there is a lack of social distancing and 19 people are gathered in groups across the terrace and lawn

At the time social mixing between households was limited to two people who could only meet outdoors and at a distance of at least 2 metres In workplaces guidance said inperson meetings should only take place if absolutely necessary

Angela Rayner the deputy leader of the Labour party described the picture as a slap in the face of the British public

The prime minister has faced a string of allegations of partying and socialising in No 10 while Covid restrictions were in place He was forced to order a civil service inquiry though its head stepped down on Friday over allegations of his own Christmas party

On the same day as the image above was taken Matt Hancock then health secretary had given a 5pm press conference urging people to stick to the rules and not take advantage of the good weather over the May weekend to socialise in groups

The Covid19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said funerals at that time were allowed fewer people in attendance than there appeared to be in the Downing Street garden and it was exhausting to see the constant flagrant disregard we have all been held in

In Haiti the worlds first blackled republic joumou soup stands for hope liberation and dignity

Before the countrys independence enslaved African people were forced to cook this dish for their owners  and were banned from eating it

But after the nation freed themselves from French colonial control joumou soup became the national symbol of liberation from slavery  and on Thursday it was added to Unescos prestigious list of intangible cultural heritage  established in 2008 to protect national traditions

In 2020 35 entries were added to the list including sauna culture in Finland sourdough making in Malta budima dancing in Zambia and a grass mowing competition in Bosnia and Herzegovina

It is Haitis first inclusion on the list and the countrys Unesco ambassador Dominique Dupuy cried as the announcement was made

The nomination of joumou soup was considered on compassionate grounds after the countrys difficult year President Jovenel Mose was assassinated in July and a devastating 72 magnitude earthquake hit the country in August

The countrys delegation to Unesco said the listing was not only a fabulous sign of hope and encouragement but also a unifying call for a Haitian people currently facing an exceptionally difficult moment in their rich history

A representative from Switzerland said joumou soup was being listed not only on compassionate grounds but because of its quality

Sean was a superb writer of comedy a clever and rigorous practitioner of the art who saw it as something to be crafted to be treated almost like poetry

For our endofyear special series paying tribute to cultural figures we lost in 2021 comedian Bill Bailey recalls more than 30 years of friendship with Sean Lock  a warm and generous writer and performer whose standup sets left audiences helpless with laughter

I met Sean at a gig where we were both performing in the late 80s and we immediately hit it off says Bailey We shared a similar sense of humour and also a sense of outsider status which gave us an added spur to succeed but with a determination to have fun while doing it

The fact that we were able to make people laugh and make a living from it felt like we were on a wild adventure that we didnt want to end

Away from the world of TV and entertainment he was a dedicated and loving family man He was a great host an excellent cook and was never happier than pottering around in the kitchen preparing a fish stew while dancing to dub reggae

Sean had that rare knack of truly great comics to be able to take audiences with him on ever more tortuous and often quite dark routes yet such was the warmth of his personality and easy manner that crowds happily followed along and his reputation grew

He was as funny off stage as on I will remember a kind generous and loyal friend who I loved dearly and feel a great sadness at his loss He leaves a wife Anoushka and their three children his sister Kate and his brothers Paul and Pete And he leaves us all a wonderful comic legacy and  for me and those lucky enough to have known him  some cherished memories and unforgettable nights of laughter

This is the story of Rajan the last oceanswimming elephant along with the fascinating background to this powerful image

In the 1970s Rajan was brought to the Andaman Islands an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal with nine other elephants to help log the islands all were forced to learn how to swim in the ocean

Elephants love fresh water but they dont like salt water because it stings their eyes and dries their skin The elephants would drag the giant cut badak trees and swim them out to barges

Once an island was logged the elephants would be made to swim to the next island Theyd sometimes swim miles which was mindblowing a group of 10 elephants swimming in open ocean

When logging was banned in 2002 Rajan was out of a job

He was the last elephant of the group to survive and lived out his days on Havelock now Swaraj Island until his death in 2016

When jodymacdonaldphoto met Rajan he was around 60 years old living out his retirement with Nazroo his caretaker who in India is called a mahout

The Canadian photographer says Every morning Rajan would go into the jungle or walk down to the beach He went swimming whenever he felt like it He seemed to have adapted to swimming in salt water and even to enjoy it I truly felt like he was having fun swimming in the ocean I think that comes across in this picture Many people tell me it looks like hes smiling

MacDonald took this photo on one of the rare occasions Rajan went on a longer swim Hed totally immerse himself and use his trunk like a snorkel which was so cool she said explaining she used a weight belt to freedive down and get the angle she wanted

Spending time with Rajan was an amazing experience He was probably the last oceanswimming elephant well ever see which gives the image extra poignancy

As logging bans have increased using elephants for logging has significantly diminished I think it still happens in some Asian countries but its a practice thats thankfully fading

If youve ever heard Logics song 18002738255 which is the number for the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline you will know how powerful the lyrics are

Now research has found that the track led to a notable rise in calls to the helpline and may have reduced the number of suicides in America

18002738255 generated strong public attention upon its release in April 2017 and notable performances at the MTV Video Music Awards and the Grammys

A new study published in the British Medical Journal BMJ showed that following these events an additional 9915 calls were recorded and there was evidence of a reduction in the number of US suicides

All these events gave widespread public attention to the message of the song  that help from Lifeline is available and effective the researchers said

Suicide prevention and education efforts must harness positive media to educate the general public and high risk groups about suicide prevention without doing harm to individuals at risk

But a major dilemma for research in this area has been that stories of hope and recovery receive much less media coverage than stories of suicide death

Just days after a heartbreaking defeat Lewis Hamilton is now Sir Lewis Hamilton The Formula One driver was knighted by Prince Charles in Windsor today in recognition of his glittering career

Over the weekend he controversially finished second at the seasonending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix  missing out on a record eighth drivers crown by the narrowest of margins  but no driver in history has won more races than him

lewishamilton was included in the new year honours list following a recordbreaking 2020 in which he eclipsed Michael Schumachers alltime victory tally and emulated the German by winning a seventh world title

The 36yearold becomes the fourth grand prix driver ever to receive this honour  following in the footsteps of Sir Jack Brabham Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart  and is the first to be awarded a knighthood while still competing

Hamilton will undoubtedly go down as one of the greats in motor racing but as important he has transcended his sport and used his fame to back the social and political causes he believes in

The British driver says the death of George Floyd last year awakened his sense of social justice I was in tears and this stuff came up that Id suppressed over all these years he said speaking to garyyounge in July

It was so powerful and sad and also releasing I thought I cant stay quiet When I did speak out that was me letting the black community know I hear you and I stand with you

Hamilton has taken the knee before races worn Tshirts supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and persuaded other drivers to join his protests Hamilton has funded an investigation into the lack of diversity within motorsport has also worn a rainbow helmet in countries that discriminate against the LGBTQ community and has spoken out against human rights abuses in countries that have hosted grands prix

This aerial shot of six dead giraffes lying in a spiral on the dry earth  their bodies emaciated and interwoven  shows the devastation of Kenyas drought which has left people and animals struggling for food and water

Already weak the animals had died after they got stuck in the mud according to photojournalist edr4m who captured the image

They were trying to reach a nearby reservoir although it had almost dried up the picture agency Getty reported

The carcasses were moved to the outskirts of Eyrib village in Wajir County to prevent contamination of the reservoir water

The local Star news website has reported that 4000 giraffes risked being wiped out by the drought

It is not just animals that are at risk An estimated 21 million Kenyans were facing starvation due to severe drought across half the state the countrys drought management authority warned in September

On Tuesday the UN said 29 million people were still in urgent need of humanitarian assistance Some areas of Kenya had recently reported their worst rainfall in decades it said

Who would be your choice for person of the year

Times magazine have gone for a highly controversial choice and given the accolade to Tesla billionaire Elon Musk describing him as a clown genius edgelord visionary industrialist and showman

But the decision has drawn sharp criticism because of Musks attitude to tax opposition to unions and playing down the dangers of Covid19

Musk who is also the founder and chief executive of space exploration company SpaceX recently passed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the worlds wealthiest person after his net worth rose to around 300bn

Time has defended its choice explaining that its annual acknowledgment was not an award but rather recognition of the person who had the most influence on the events of the year for good or for ill

The title has previously been bestowed to popes Ebola healthcare workers and Greta Thunberg but also Hitler and Stalin who received it twice In 1982 it went to The Computer Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were Time magazines person  or persons  of the year for 2020

Its not rocket science  or is it

Researchers have found aerospace engineers and brain surgeons are not necessarily brighter than the general population

After examining data from an international cohort of 329 aerospace engineers and 72 neurosurgeons  and comparing results against those previously gathered from more than 18000 members of the British public here is what they learned

Researchers asked the aerospace engineers and neurosurgeons to complete 12 tasks online using the Great British Intelligence Test GBIT  and to answer some supporting questions The tasks examined various aspects of cognition including planning and reasoning working memory attention and emotion processing abilities

The findings reveal that only neurosurgeons showed a significant difference with quicker problemsolving speed but slower memory recall compared with the general population which researchers noted might arise from the fastpaced nature of neurosurgery which attracts those with a preexisting flair for rapid processing 

They said the study was in part carried out to lay to rest the question of whether one of the professions had the intellectual upper hand  a tension made famous by the Mitchell and Webb sketch in which a swaggering neurosurgeon is slapped down by an aerospace expert who says Brain surgery  its not exactly rocket science is it

However the team found few differences between the cognitive abilities of aerospace engineers and neuroscientists although the results suggest the former had higher scores for attention and mental manipulation  such as rotating objects in ones head  while neurosurgeons showed higher scores in semantic problem solving  such as definitions of rare words

Essentially what we think it shows is that everyone has a range of skills  and it is very difficult to be better in everything across the board said Aswin Chari a neurosurgical trainee at Great Ormond Street hospital and an author of the study

Referencing the two professions Chari added It is not that they are better at everything but they are better at certain things that make them good at what they do

Saudi authorities have carried out their biggest crackdown on camel beauty contestants disqualifying more than 40 enhanced camels from the annual pageant according to the staterun Saudi Press Agency

The camels disqualified in the competition at the King Abdulaziz camel festival were judged to have received Botox injections and other artificial touchups

The festival which started this month invites the breeders of the most beautiful camels to compete for about 66m in prize money

Botox injections facelifts and other cosmetic alterations to make the camels more attractive are strictly prohibited Jurors decide the winner based on the shape of the animals heads necks humps dress and postures

Judges at the monthlong festival held in the desert northeast of the Saudi capital Riyadh are escalating their clampdown on artificially enhanced camels the official news agency reported using specialised and advanced technology to detect tampering

This year the authorities discovered dozens of breeders had stretched out the lips and noses of camels used hormones to boost the animals muscles injected heads and lips with Botox to make them bigger inflated body parts with rubber bands and used fillers to relax their faces

The club is keen to halt all acts of tampering and deception in the beautification of camels the SPA report said adding organisers would impose strict penalties on manipulators

The camel beauty contest is at the heart of the massive carnival which also features camel races sales and other festivities typically showcasing thousands of dromedaries

Camel breeding is a multimilliondollar industry  and events like this seek to preserve the camels role in the Bedouin tradition and heritage as the oilrich country ploughs ahead with modernising mega projects

Ten teachers were pitted against each other to scramble for dollar bills to fund school supplies in a city in South Dakota

The competition has been described as demeaning and drawn comparisons with the Netflix hit series Squid Game

The local newspaper the Argus Leader reported 5000 3770 in single dollar bills were laid out on the ice skating rink during the Sioux Falls Stampede hockey game on Saturday night and the teachers from nearby schools competed to grab as many as possible in less than five minutes

Footage of the competition that went viral on social media showed teachers stuffing the notes down their jumpers and into hats while the audience cheered

The money was reportedly donated by CU Mortgage Direct to fund teaching supplies and classroom repairs

With everything that has gone on for the last couple of years with teachers and everything we thought it was an awesome group thing to do for the teachers Ryan Knudson a marketing spokesperson for CU Mortgage Direct told the Argus Leader

The American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten tweeted that the display just feels demeaning adding that No doubt people probably intended it to be fun but from the outside it feels terrible

On social media the dash for cash footage was described as humiliating and dystopian Some people likened the footage to scenes from Squid Game or the Hunger Games franchise

The teachers involved in the competition appreciated the cash and said they planned to use it to buy flexible seating such as standing desks or wobble chairs or document cameras so they could upload lessons online the Argus Leader reported

These satellite images show the trail of destruction left by what could prove to be the longest tornado in US history

Joe Biden has declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky after a swarm of deadly tornadoes hit the state on Friday

Nowhere suffered as much as Mayfield a community of about 10000 in the southwestern corner of Kentucky

The large twisters destroyed fire and police stations as well as a candle factory pictured on the cover where 110 employees were working the night shift Eight have been confirmed dead and eight others remained missing said Bob Ferguson a spokesperson for Mayfield Consumer Products which owns the factory He said 90 people had been located a figure that authorities were still trying to confirm on Monday morning

Kentucky governor Andy Beshear said the tornadoes were the most destructive in the states history

The very first thing that we have to do is grieve together and were going to do that before we rebuild together he said

One tornado tore across 227 miles 365 km of terrain almost all of that in Kentucky which if confirmed would surpass the 218mile TriState tornado in 1925 which killed at least 695 people and destroyed 15000 homes across Missouri Illinois and Indiana

On Sunday morning Beshear had said that the death toll was expected to exceed 100 but later that figure had been revised down although amid power cuts and phone services down across many communities there was not yet certainty over numbers

Elsewhere the death toll from multiple tornadoes included six people in Illinois where an Amazon depot was hit four people in Tennessee two in Arkansas where a nursing home was destroyed and two in Missouri

Spring is the main season for tornadoes and this latest event was very unusual coming in December when colder weather normally limits tornadoes experts have said

Masses of ocean plastic are providing artificial habitat for otherwise coastal species according to a new study

So what exactly does this mean And what are neopelagic communities

The authors of this new study  published in the peerreviewed journal Nature Communications  say they observed floating water bottles old toothbrushes and matted fishing nets  and concluded that the possibility exists that species may be evolving to better adapt to life on plastic

A decade ago marine researchers believed coastal organisms which evolved to live along sheltered shorelines could not survive a trip across the inhospitable open ocean

Yet Japans 2011 tsunami which sent some 300 species of Asian marine life riding durable and buoyant plastic garbage onto North American shores disproved that assumption

Now scientists believe seafaring colonies of anemones brittle stars shrimp barnacles and more are thriving on plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and washing up wherever the currents take them

Ocean plastic is  creating opportunities for coastal species biogeography to greatly expand beyond what we previously thought was possible Linsey Haram a research associate at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and coauthor of the study said

But the sheer density of plastic in the ocean is still a great concern according to marine ecotoxicologist experts like Juan Jos Alava PhD at the University of British Columbia

While small species can make a life for themselves within these permanent floating plastic structures they also attract creatures higher up the food chain like fish turtles and larger mammals who through curiosity become caught and entangled in the plastic and die

The 2021 UN report after Cop26 was clear that the scale of rapidly increasing plastic pollution is putting the health of all the worlds oceans and seas at risk says Alava

This is a quote from a former seaman whose job it was to retrieve the dead bodies of Indonesian and Somalian people who lost their lives trying to seek asylum in Australia

The seaman anonymously identified as Witness BR2 told the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide he had been with the navy for less than a year when he was deployed on Operation Resolute

He said its mission had been to intercept suspect vessels off the north coast but none of the rushed training the crew had prepared them what was to come  and he was so tormented by what he saw he is still haunted by the memories 10 years later

BR2 said the first time he and the crew had found bodies in the water they were forced to abandon them because it was untenable due to  the decay of a body at sea after time

I remember one of my mates saying I think that is a doll in the water It was actually a baby I just remembered he lost the innocence in his face a bit

On another occasion the crew had come across 230 Somali asylum seekers in rough seas in a vessel that looked like a double decker bus he said

I was a pretty ignorant 21yearold kid thinking that these people dont deserve to come here because why are they jumping the queue he said That changed pretty quickly meeting these people These people  are some of the most genuine people Ive ever met

BR2 told the commission he had felt a growing sense of guilt and anger because doing his job meant handing over people theyd saved just to put them basically in prison ashore

He added that his attitudes towards the asylum seekers had radically changed after witnessing their desperation and suffering and the way they were being treated by the Australian government

He also told the commission he had started drinking even more heavily to cope with his anger and distress and had daily thoughts of suicide and was later diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder

What do you think of New Zealands plan to ban smoking for the next generation

The country has announced that those who are born after 2008 will never be legally able to buy tobacco

New legislation means the legal smoking age will increase every year to create a smokefree generation of New Zealanders associate health minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said on Thursday

This is a historic day for the health of our people she said

The government announced the rising age alongside other measures to make smoking unaffordable and inaccessible to try to reach its goal of making the country entirely smokefree within the next four years

Other measures include reducing the legal amount of nicotine in tobacco products to very low levels cutting down the shops where cigarettes could legally be sold and increasing funding to addiction services The new laws will not restrict vape sales

We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth People aged 14 when the law comes into effect will never be able to legally purchase tobacco Verrall said

Hows this for an archaeological find

A preIncan mummy found in Peru and thought to be between 800 and 1200 years old has gone on display at the San Marcos University in Lima

Archaeologists reported finding the preInca Mummy of Cajamarquilla in an underground tomb in November

The remains which were discovered with ropes around its hands were found alongside offerings including ceramics vegetable remains and stone tools

It is the latest of many stunning archaeological discoveries in Peru The South American country which is home to the iconic Machu Picchu has hundreds of sites from cultures that developed before and after the Inca Empire which dominated the southern part of South America 500 years ago

When a pitch invader held up play during Chelseas Champions League clash with Juventus this is how striker Sam Kerr responded

The Australia captain dropped her shoulder and ran into the man knocking him to the ground 

The boos that had greeted the invader instantly turned to cheers for Kerr before the man took to his feet and made his way from the pitch with stewards in pursuit to applause from the stands 

Kerrs take down earned her a yellow card  and plenty of praise on social media Sports reporter Vince Rugari joked It was hard to think of a way Sam Kerr could finish this week that would endear her to Australian fans even more beyond what shes achieved on the field This was the only way

A historic vote granting equal marriage rights to samesex couples in Chile has been heralded by activists as a triumph and a blow to the conservative agenda of presidential candidate Jos Antonio Kast

Marriage equality is a ray of sunshine a bit of hope said Isabel Amor director of the gay rights organization Iguales who said that the countrys LGBTQ community is in a very fragile emotional state with the threat of a Kast presidency We have to ask what we will lose if he gets the presidency

Kast won a plurality of votes in Novembers firstround vote  taking 28 of the vote and beating the progressive former student leader Gabriel Boric by two percentage points  an outcome that sent a wave of fear through the countrys LGBTQ community A tight runoff between Kast and Boric is scheduled for 19 December

While Boric advocates greater rights for minorities Kasts agenda is founded upon traditionalist politics formed by devout Catholic values

Kast who denies he is homophobic has said that society works best with heterosexual couples his presidential program offers subsidies to married heterosexual families with children deliberately excluding samesex couples

During his 16 years as a deputy he resisted progressive legislation voting against an antidiscrimination law in 2012 and the Civil Union agreement in 2015  both of which were eventually passed He fiercely opposed the gender identity bill which was passed in 2018 to give legal protections to trans people

The equal marriage bill expected to be signed into law before March will allow samesex couples parental rights which was not possible under the Civil Union act It was first submitted by Michelle Bachelets government in 2017 but was neglected by lawmakers until given urgent status by president Sebastian Piera in June

Piera previously opposed the law but said life and meeting people had led him to change his mind

Chile is the sixth nation in South America to legalize samesex marriage joining Argentina Uruguay Brazil Colombia and Ecuador

This heartbreaking image shows a young Rohingya refugee in 2017 crying as he climbs on a truck distributing aid near the Balukali refugee camp in Coxs Bazar

He was among the more than half a million Rohingya refugees forced into Bangladesh fleeing an offensive by Myanmars military that the UN called a textbook example of ethnic cleansing

Now Facebook is being accused of facilitating the genocide of Rohingya the Muslim minority in Myanmar through negligence  and facing compensation claims worth more than 150bn The social media networks algorithms amplified hate speech and the platform failed to take down inflammatory posts according to legal action launched in the US and the UK

The American complaint cites Facebook posts that appeared in a Reuters report with one in 2013 stating We must fight them the way Hitler did the Jews damn Kalars a derogatory term for Rohingya people Another post in 2018 showing a photograph of a boatload of Rohingya refugees says Pour fuel and set fire so that they can meet Allah faster

Facebook admitted three years ago that it had not done enough to prevent the incitement of violence and hate speech against the Rohingya

But one of the law firms says Despite Facebooks recognition of its culpability  there has not been a single penny of compensation nor any other form of reparations or support offered to any survivor

The number of Rohingya killed in 2017 during the Myanmar militarys clearance operations is likely to be more than 10000 according to the charity Mdicins sans Frontires

About 1 million Rohingyas live in Coxs Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh where refugees say they are dealing with the trauma of witnessing mass killings rape and the torching of villages as they remain trapped in squalid camps

Facebooks owner Meta said Were appalled by the crimes  Weve built a dedicated team of Burmese speakers banned the Tatmadaw Myanmars state military disrupted networks manipulating public debate and taken action on harmful misinformation to help keep people safe

Rapper Travis Scott has denied responsibility for deaths at the Astroworld festival in Houston where 10 people died last month when the crowd surged toward the stage

The incident was among the deadliest live music crowd events in recent US history

More than 140 lawsuits have been filed so far including a mass litigation suit brought by more than 1500 concertgoers Most of the cases allege the defendants including Scott were negligent and stood to gain from continuing the concert despite the crowd control issues

Scott denies the allegations

In court documents responding to six lawsuits obtained earlier this week by CNN attorneys for Scott asked for the cases to be dismissed and barred from being brought again Defendants generally deny the allegations set forth they said

Families of victims blasted the rappers legal filings as shameful

Houston attorney James Lassiter told CNN that Scott continues using social media to present a public image of someone who is grieved by the catastrophic loss of life that his actions caused while quietly paying celebrity lawyers to argue his victims deserve nothing more than symbolic help with funeral costs

Soon after the tragedy Scott released a video statement to say he was honestly just devastated by the tragedy

Scott has offered to pay for the funerals of victims of the crowd control disaster However at least one family that of the youngest victim Ezra Blount nine declined the offer

Another Houston attorney Brent Coons is demanding Scott pay 10bn to settle litigation from the disaster The attorney represents 1547 concertgoers which the law firm said is the largest suit to date Lawyers have asked the court to combine to cases to make litigation speedier

What happened at Astroworld was an unconscionable tragedy and it is important that justice is served for all those impacted said Coons

The UK government is facing a furious backlash after senior No 10 officials were filmed joking about a lockdown Christmas party that Downing Street insists did not take place

Prime minister Boris Johnson along with a number of Conservative ministers and MPs are facing accusations of lying after repeatedly denying that the event reportedly held for staff at No 10 in December last year broke Covid rules or took place at all

In the leaked video of a mock televised press briefing an adviser to Johnson is seen joking with Allegra Stratton the prime ministers then press secretary about a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night

The footage obtained by ITV was shot on 22 December 2020 The Friday before was 18 December the date on which multiple sources have said there was a staff party inside Downing Street which would have contravened strict Covid regulations in place at the time

Testimony from many sources says No 10 staff held a party that day with a Secret Santa refreshments and games

The emergence of this video has been called a bullet to the chest of families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic Dr Saleyha Ahsan from the Covid19 Bereaved Families for Justice told BBC Breakfast the saga was an example of how the government have run this from the start one rule for them and the rest of us have to adhere to different rules

Ahsan who said she had been working in north Wales at the time of the mock press conference said Numerous people around the country couldnt spend those precious last few days hours minutes with loved ones It was heartbreaking In 14 years in the NHS Ive never seen anything like it

The shadow foreign secretary David Lammy wrote on Twitter  This is absolutely sickening They are laughing at us all Its one rule for them and another for the rest of us

Asked about the footage Downing Street insisted it had not changed its view saying There was no Christmas party Covid rules have been followed at all times

Our culture is disappearing

Climate breakdown is crushing the way people have previously lived for hundreds of years

As part of our push to hear more from those on the frontlines we have been profiling individuals whose lives have been changed beyond recognition From Taymyr in Russia this is Gennadiy Shukins story

I was born in 1962 in a family of deer herders in Taymyr on a peninsula in the very far north of Russia

I am part of the Dolgan community we are an Indigenous Russian group and there are around 6000 left of us living in the tundra

Growing up the Soviet Union tried to deny us our traditional way of life but since then climate change has become the biggest challenge to our survival

Our community lives by hunting fishing and herding deer Scientists say that Taymyr has the most rapid temperature increase in Russia and we can really feel it

Because of the warmer winters we have seen that deer are giving birth earlier in the year Many are born too weak and dont survive the long journeys they have to make This means there is much less deer for us to hunt and it hurts the whole ecosystem

Rivers and lakes that we use for fishing have also started to dry out Others are too polluted after all the big oil and gas plants have sprung up over the years in our lands Some days we dont catch any fish at all

For generations we have sold the food we caught to local towns and cities to buy basic products like sugar and wheat Without animals we cannot survive

Big craters are also forming because the Arctic permafrost is starting to melt under our feet This means the routes that we have used for decades to travel hunt and fish have to be adjusted as whole roads have sunk It is also dangerous as you never know where the next crater will form

The youth sees that climate change makes our traditional way of life impossible and they are forced to move to the bigger cities to find jobs which are often lowpaid Our culture is disappearing

A damning new light has been shed on the hourbyhour decisions made by the UK Foreign Office in the days after the Taliban takeover

Former desk officer Raphael Marshall has blown the whistle on what he says was internal bureaucratic chaos ministerial intervention lack of planning and a shorthours culture following the fall of Kabul led to people being left to die at the hands of the Taliban

He has now quit the department and in testimony to the foreign affairs select committee published on Tuesday has revealed the extent of what he witnessed

Then foreign minister Dominic Raab who was on holiday when Kabul fell has been accused of misunderstanding the haphazard process and desperate position at Kabul airport by delaying several emergency evacuation referrals

Raab has rebuffed a number of the charges saying he would make no apology for requesting officials redo urgent appeals for help from Afghans in a different spreadsheet format But it is likely the Marshalls evidence and the launch of the still unpublished internal inquiry contributed to the decision to move Raab to a new cabinet role

You hear one budgie that first fella comes in he flies past then another one then its like over a short time maybe five minutes they all just turn up and start arriving en masse  Theres a critical mass that sweeps in

Its spectacular

The visual stuff its mesmerising you cant look away its spectacular It is a dynamic expression of nature he added

In a surprise motion just last week Canada voted to ban LGBTQ conversion therapy but the practice is still legal in most parts of the world In the UK there are proposals to restrict it but not ban it and in the US its legal in most states

We spoke to drewamstutz about how he recovered after the practice which he says his mum and dad referred to as tough love

This piece is considered a God not just a sculpture

For more than 20 years those who lived in and around the village of Lokhari in Uttar Pradesh India have prayed for the return of an important statue of a goddess that was stolen from a local temple

Now the 8thcentury goatheaded deity has been discovered thousands of miles away  in a garden in the UK and will formally be given back to the High Commission of India in London

It is a case that shames Sothebys which offered the statue for sale in 1988 a few years before the auctioneer was to face serious allegations of having encouraged looting of ancient Indian religious sites

In 1997 the statue was among looted antiquities featured in the former Observer journalist Peter Watsons damning book titled Sothebys Inside Story He and investigators from the Channel 4 Dispatches programme also secretly filmed Indian dealers claiming that they had supplied an entire containerload of objects some of which were sold at Sothebys in London It led to the auction house ending regular antiquities sales in London and tightening up procedures to ensure it would not handle an item if there was a suspicion it might have been looted abroad

This recovery has been made possible by Christopher Marinello a leading expert in recovering stolen looted and missing art This piece is considered a god not just a sculpture he said Looted objects are not simply financial assets for collectors and auction houses to profit from

He added My goal is to call out Sothebys for selling loot but more importantly to highlight the countless looted objects in English gardens and collections related to colonial history

Sothebys said This episode relates to something that allegedly occurred almost quarter of a century ago Sothebys adheres to the highest standards in the industry supported by a worldclass compliance team who work closely with outside authorities to ensure that we operate to the highest level of business integrity

How can you manipulate the weather

Chinese weather authorities successfully controlled the weather ahead of a major political celebration earlier this year according to a Beijing university study

On 1 July the Chinese Communist party marked its centenary with major celebrations including tens of thousands of people at a ceremony in Tiananmen Square and a research paper from Tsinghua University has said an extensive cloudseeding operation in the hours prior ensured clear skies and low air pollution

Cloudseeding is a weather modification technique which sees the adding of chemicals like small particles of silver iodide to clouds causing water droplets to cluster around them and increasing the chance of precipitation

The researchers said in this instance the resulting artificial rain reduced the level of PM25 air pollutants by more than twothirds and shifted the air quality index reading based on World Health Organization standards from moderate to good

The Chinese government has been an enthusiastic proponent of cloudseeding technology spending billions of dollars on efforts to manipulate the weather to protect agricultural regions or improve significant events including the 2008 Olympics

Last year Beijing announced plans to expand its experimental weather modification program to an area 15 times the size of India covered by artificial rain or snow

While there is a growing body of scientific evidence around the success of cloudseeding there is also a debate about whether manipulating the weather in one area could disrupt weather systems elsewhere

Bol Kek 45 lives in Paguir in South Sudan and in this image shes collecting water lily bulbs to ground down and eat

Where she lives theres very little food and no land to cultivate after three years of floods Fields are submerged in flood water and higher ground is overcrowded in what is quickly becoming a humanitarian crisis

Many of those who lost this years harvest also lost their livestock to diseases caused by the animals grazing on flooded fields Without the milk and meat traditionally provided by cattle to fill the gaps many people are looking for wild food

South Sudan is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate breakdown according to the Global Climate Index

An estimated 17 million people are displaced within South Sudan Meanwhile the UN says the country as a whole has 8 million people in need An estimated 25 million people are facing severe food insecurity and more than 100000 are considered close to famine

The Cop26 climate talks may now feel like a distant memory now but this is the time where the real work must happen 

Native Alaskan climate activist charitieropati has been highlighting the urgent need to centre Black and Indigenous voices when we have conversations about the climate breakdown

My great grandfather predicted that the ice was rotting thats how he described it to my mother in Yupik says Charitie

The 20yearold columbia student spoke to us about her people who rely on Alaskas ice and sea for food and how an intimate relationship and respect for the land makes Indigenous knowledge so crucial in caring for the future of the planet

Its hard for settlers to hear this she says but one of the biggest things to combat climate change is giving sovereignty back to Indigenous peoples over their land Giving land back

This is the last episode in our new miniseries which we created to help platform underrepresented Indigenous voices at a time when their knowledge and traditions could mean the difference of creating a habitable planet

Fifty years ago on 15 September 1971 a ship named the Greenpeace set out to confront and stop US nuclear weapons testing at Amchitka one of the Aleutian Islands in southwest Alaska

Photographers had been using their images for years to publicise situations around the world But as a young organisation  pioneering a new kind of activism  greenpeace began to realise that capturing images of what they were doing and seeing would play a vital role in their work

The campaigners quickly learned how to harness the power and strength of emotive images bringing the world shocking scenes of seal pups clubbed by hunters and the inspirational images of activists standing up to whaling ships including the image on the cover of this gallery show them trying to hinder the shooting of a minke whale in 2005

Vegan alternatives to leather could save more than just animals The scientists behind fashions new latest musthave  the mushroom leather handbag  believe that mycelium a material grown from fungi which can be engineered to look and feel like calfskin or sheepskin could help save the planet

Speaking to the Guardian before a talk at the Business of Fashion Voices conference in Oxfordshire Dr Matt Scullin CEO of biomaterials company MycoWorks forecast that mushroom leather could be a sustainability gamechanger unlocking a future of design which begins with the material not with the object

Fine Mycelium a patented material which can be grown from fungi in trays in a matter of weeks replicates the appearance and feel of leather while outperforming it in strength and durability The material recently made its high fashion debut as an exclusive Herms handbag

It can give the same emotional response as an animal leather It has that handfeel of rarity says Scullin On a planet of finite natural resources Scullin believes both the technology and the mindset of carbonneutral growntoorder mushroom leather could be revolutionary  and have implications for innovation in manufacture beyond fashion

From guardianus why is meaningful action to avert the climate crisis proving so difficult It is at least in part because of ads

The fossil fuel industry has perpetrated a multidecade multibillion dollar disinformation propaganda and lobbying campaign to delay climate action by confusing the public and policymakers about the climate crisis and its solutions

Theyd now like us to forget many of them But seeing the adverts in their shameless glory is a crucial part of understanding how we got here and the halftruths distortions and outright lies were still being fed

In 1962 Humble Oil now ExxonMobil released perhaps one of the most outrageous adverts ever made Each day it boasted Humble supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier

It was an early example of Big Oils desperate push against climate science which only grew louder and more cynical in the following decades before pivoting towards greenwashing and personal responsibility narratives in the 2000s  and companies have been distorting reality in the 2020s too

Ilhan Omar played a harrowing death threat recently left on her voicemail as she implored House Republican leaders to do more to tamp down antiMuslim hatred in their ranks and hold those who perpetuate it accountable

The Democratic Minnesota representative one of only a handful of Muslim members of Congress has been the subject of repeated attacks by conservative pundits and some Republicans in Congress which she says have led to an increase in the number of death threats she receives

Recently a video of the firstterm Colorado representative Lauren Boebert calling ilhanmn a member of the jihad squad and likening her to a bombcarrying terrorist went viral

When a sitting member of Congress calls a colleague a member of the jihad squad and falsifies a story to suggest I will blow up the Capitol it is not just an attack on me but on millions of American Muslims across the country Omar said during a news conference on Tuesday We cannot pretend this hate speech from leading politicians doesnt have real consequences

She then played the voicemail laden with profanity racial epithets and a threat to take you off the face of this fucking Earth which she said was among hundreds of such messages she has reported since joining Congress Omar said the voicemail was left for her after repboebert released another video on Monday criticising her

Boeberts remarks were the latest example of a Republican lawmaker making a personal attack against another member of Congress an unsettling trend that has gone largely unchecked by House Republican leaders

Red paint sprayed across the streets and dummies sprawled on the pavements this image shows one of the latest protests against Polands neartotal ban on abortions

Womens rights activists in Warsaw used the figures to symbolise those suffering under the restrictive laws with the paint representing their blood

The protest was part of a demonstration against new government plans to register every pregnancy in a national database and a proposal to further restrict abortion

Activists fear the database will allow Polands rightwing authorities to track whether pregnancies end in a birth and become a tool for possible prosecutions

Abortion has always been strictly controlled in Poland but laws were tightened further this year sparking an outcry and mass protests

Currently abortions are only allowed in cases of rape or incest or if the womans life is in danger Though activists say many doctors now wait for a foetus with no chance of survival to die in the womb rather than perform an abortion because they fear being sent to jail

Polands health minister denied that there was a pregnancy register saying that the government was just turning all the files digital from paper

But parliament is scheduled to debate a proposal for a complete ban on abortion including in cases of rape and danger to a womans health If this becomes law activists who assist women in having abortions risk facing years of imprisonment for murder  where the penalty could range from five years to a life sentence

Amnesty International has called on Polish lawmakers to reject the sinister bill and the latest in a wave of cruel and discriminatory attacks on womens human rights

This is NOT the answer

An increasing number of countries are banning travel to and from countries in Africa due to the Omicron Covid variant

Despite the variant being found in Europe before South African detected and flagged it to the world it is the African nations that have been closed off from countries like Canada UK US Australia Denmark France Italy Germany Singapore and Saudi Arabia to name a few

This has sparked a conversation online about how these bans are could be fuelled by racism and how this situation was inevitable due to vaccine inequality across the world

Heres an excerpt

Toughening up restrictions in the west in response to Omicron is a classic case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted because for months the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been warning rich developed countries that an end to the pandemic requires poor people as well as rich to be vaccinated

Donald Trump tested positive for Covid19 three days before his first debate against Joe Biden the former presidents fourth and last chief of staff has revealed in a new book A copy was obtained by the Guardian

Mark Meadows also writes that though he knew each candidate was required to test negative for the virus within seventy two hours of the start time  Nothing was going to stop Trump from going out there

Trump Meadows says in the book returned a negative result from a different test shortly after the positive

Nonetheless the stunning revelation of an unreported positive test follows a year of speculation about whether Trump then 74 years old had the potentially deadly virus when he faced Biden 77 in Cleveland on 29 September  and what danger that might have presented

Despite the president looking a little tired and suspecting a slight cold Meadows says he was content that Trump travelled that evening to a rally in Middletown Pennsylvania
But as Marine One lifted off Meadows writes the White House doctor called

Stop the president from leaving Meadows says Sean Conley told him He just tested positive for Covid

It wasnt possible to stop Trump but when he called from Air Force One his chief of staff gave him the news

Mr President Meadows said Ive got some bad news Youve tested positive for Covid19

From Adidas to Zara new research into the fashion industrys complex global supply chains shows that a number of large fashion brands are at risk of contributing to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest based on their connections to tanneries and other companies involved in the production of leather and leather goods

The report released by Standearth on Monday analysed nearly 500000 rows of customs data and found that brands such as Coach LVMH Prada HM Zara Adidas Nike New Balance Teva UGG and Fendi have multiple connections to an industry that props up Amazon deforestation

Angeline Robertson an investigative researcher who worked on the study told us she hopes the fashion industry will take cues from their analysis and work in their own selfinterest Adding In this time of climate emergency if the fashion industry wants to be relevant this is the opportunity

This analysis does not prove a direct link between each fashion brand and Amazon deforestation instead researchers found connections that increase the probability of any individual garment coming from cattle ranching in the Amazon an industry described as the No 1 culprit of deforestation in the area

As a child street photographer David Godlis would visit his grandparents in Miami Beach

When he returned a decade later in the 70s as a 22yearold photography student godlis decided to retrace his steps and document a nowlost world of art deco hotels and sunbathing retirees

While walking the streets all day he discovered a rich Jewish retiree enclave on the expansive beaches facing the Atlantic ocean Godlis says he ended up shooting about 60 rolls of film

All these memories of Florida came flowing back to me As I tripped the shutter over and over taking pictures on those beaches I had walked upon as a little kid everything clicked

These retirees all dressed up in their best beach outfits would spend their days on loungers and lawn chairs playing cards amid the sunshine and palm trees offering themselves as perfect subjects

For them  Jewish eastern European immigrants who had lived out their working life on the street of New York  retiring to sunshine warm weather beaches and palm trees was a slice of heaven For me it was like a Jewish Disneyland Goodbye snow hello coconuts

Barbados is set to become the first nation to remove Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state in nearly three decades

From midnight tonight the Caribbean nation will officially declare itself a republic a move that was flagged last year in the thick of activism inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and was recommended over 20 years ago by a government commission

It is a rejection of the British monarchy part of a wider campaign that includes strengthening ties with the African nations from which most Barbadians claim heritage and renewing demands for the UK government to make reparations for its historical crimes

In an official ceremony attended by Prince Charles Barbados the current governorgeneral Dame Sandra Mason pictured above will be sworn in to serve a fouryear term as president

The 17th century sugar revolution which made England extraordinarily rich was built on the backs of enslaved Africans taken to work on plantations in Barbados and other Caribbean islands It was in Barbados that the slavery plantation production model was invented  right here says David Comissiong the countrys ambassador to Caricom a Caribbean regional integration body

Reclassified under British law as property the men women and children who worked the cane fields of Barbados were subject to unimaginable brutality The first systematic study of the health of those buried at the Newton Slave Burial Ground found the average life expectancy of those examined was 18 years old with the lives of women thought to be especially appalling

Barbados was a hellhole Comissiong says For black people Barbados was a brutal hellish society

Alexander Downes 32 started the petition which resulted in the removal of the statues of British slavery defender Horatio Nelson from the countrys capital last year

Asked what the crown means to him Downes is clear It signifies a time when people who looked like me  were almost considered just a part in the process of generating wealth he says Humanity was not considered Civil rights were not considered

For most of her childhood Antonella Bordons silky hair ran all the way down her back to her calves

But when her school was forced to stay shut through the coronavirus pandemic  leaving her stuck inside her home near Buenos Aires  she dreamed of the day she would again join her friends in the classroom

The 12yearold made a promise to herself when that day finally came she would cut her nearly floorlength locks right off

irinawerning began photographing Antonellas long hair three years ago and continued documenting her after Covid reached Argentina

During this time Wernings series La Promesa the Promise became not just about the hair itself they told the story of Antonellas experience that of a young girl constrained by one of the longest governmentenforced lockdowns in the world and isolated from her friends

Werning said I showed her doing Zoom classes I shot her in moments where she was very anxious for her future I photographed her helping at the shop I photographed her in very limited situations because she was not seeing her friends or doing anything but her hair was the protagonist of everything

Schools were forced to close across the world when the Covid19 crisis hit but children in Latin America are said to have lost about three months more class time than their contemporaries elsewhere and it is estimated more than three million may never return to school

In the end Antonella missed 260 days of school She was fortunate in the sense that she was living in a household where education was a priority  her mother always made her phone available so she could study During lockdown both her parents lost their job and instead have now opened a shop in their small family home

When Antonellas school fully reopened in September she followed through with her pledge and cut her hair Its now waiting to be donated to be made into a wig for cancer patients

The truth is says Bordon I wasnt sad when I cut it  I was happy Ive become a different person

24yearold banking and finance graduate Haider Malik was tired of online applications and Zoom interviews

So he took his whiteboard  complete with QR codes for his CV and LinkedIn page  and stood in the middle of Londons financial district outside Canary Wharf tube station

He said it was inspired by his father Mehmood Malik a retired cab driver who came to the UK from Pakistan as a teenager to provide for his family

I decided to get out of my comfort zone and get some well needed human interaction he said

Malik said he felt really nervous at first but decided to start handing out CVs and wishing commuters a nice morning

I became more approachable and it was really noticed by the commuters Within an hour I had given away all 50 of my CVs

Within two hours of being outside the tube station Malik was interviewed for a job as a treasury analyst he had a second interview by Friday and was given the job

After going viral Malik was shocked to hear back from recruiters about roles hed applied for six months ago It just shows that having reach and standing out is so important in the current recruitment process he said

He started his first day at Canary Wharf Group and is now looking to help students and graduates into entrylevel jobs through events that bridge the gap between applicants and recruiters

Typically after choosing a partner only 13 albatross would separate in search of greener romantic pastures but a new study has found warmer waters mean the birds are travelling further for food and that has caused the separation rate to rise up to 8 For seabirds warmer waters mean less fish less food and a harsher environment Fewer chicks survive The birds stress hormones increase They are forced farther afield to hunt

Albatross usually live for around 5060 years They have a long awkward teen phase as they learn how to seduce a mate through dance and take yearslong trips away from home as they mature They usually to mate for life and loudly celebrate when greeting a partner after a long absence

But now they increasingly share another rite of passage that may sound familiar to young humans under stress from the climate crisis working longer hours to eat and faced with the logistical difficulties of a traveling partner some are struggling to maintain relationships

The Royal Society study which looked at a wild population of 15500 breeding pairs in the Falkland Islands over 15 years comes as many international albatross populations are in trouble

Their numbers are plummeting by 510 every year and have been dropping since around 2005 says Dr Graeme Elliot principal science adviser at New Zealands department of conservation who has been studying albatrosses for three decades He says this is as a result of less prey warming seas and increasing encounters with tuna linefishing boats which accidentally catch and kill the birds

Elliot now hopes that some of the sympathies people have for albatrosses could motivate changes in behaviour to address the environmental threats the birds are facing  particularly climate change and tuna fishing We kind of need an international campaign to save these birds If we dont turn it around theyll go extinct

Pregnant women and three children were among the 27 people mostly Kurds from Iraq or Iran who drowned trying to cross the Channel authorities have said

The International Organisation for Migration said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel  the busiest shipping lane in the world  since it began collecting data in 2014

The numbers crossing the Channel in small boats have more than tripled so far this year compared with last years total  an increase from 8469 for the whole of 2020 compared with 25700 so far this year

Enver Solomon the chief executive of the refugeecouncil said How many tragedies like this must we see before the government fundamentally changes its approach 

Every day people are forced to flee their homes through no fault of their own Now is the time to end the cruel and ineffective tactic of seeking to punish or push away those who try and find safety in our country

Relief emotion and a sense of hope came flooding across Georgia on social media and throughout the US as the nation came to terms with the Ahmaud Arbery verdicts and their place in history

For many observers the highprofile case of the three white men convicted of murdering Arbery a 25yearold Black man who was out jogging revealed the racist ways the American legal system has been designed to treat Black people differently

Arbery was killed in February 2020 in the coastal town of Satilla Shores Georgia None of the men involved Gregory McMichael 67 his 35yearold son Travis McMichael and their neighbor William Roddie Bryan 52 were charged until eyewitness footage was made public months later shortly before the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis prompting widespread protests

Outside the courthouse in Brunswick yesterday in front of a joyous flagwaving crowd Arberys mother Wanda CooperJones pictured on the penultimate slide with Rev Al Sharpton said Its been a long fight its been a hard fight  To tell you the truth I never saw this day Back in 2020 I never thought this day would come  Thank you to those who marched the ones who prayed thank you 

She said her son will now rest in peace

Arberys father Marcus Arbery thanked his sons mother and the activists and lawyers who helped draw attention to his sons case God put us all together to make this happen he said We conquered that lynch mob We got that lynch mob 

From the Oval Office Joe Biden reflected on Arberys killing as a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country but saw the trials outcome as a beacon of hope

Outside court civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton told the cheering crowd Brunswick Georgia will go down in history as the place where criminal justice took a different turn Decades from now theyll be talking about a boy called Ahmaud Arbery who taught this nation what justice looks like

Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghan girls and young women university student Hawa has not been allowed to return to her studies since the Taliban seized power earlier this year 

Instead she has been stuck at home poring over books by a window her dreams on hold

Along with many of her peers Hawa is feeling a mixture of sadness frustration and anger that her aspirations to study and work are being thwarted

The hardline Islamist movement is now allowing all boys and younger girls back to class but are not letting girls attend secondary school Most public universities are not functioning at all or only partially

The current edict makes Afghanistan the only country on earth to bar half its population from getting a secondary education  and the decision worryingly echoes of the tactics used by the Taliban when they last ruled from 19962001

The three white men who chased and killed Ahmaud Arbery have been found guilty of murder following his 2020 shooting death in south Georgia which led to a wave of racial justice protest and a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in the US

Travis McMicheal his father Greg McMichael and their neighbour William Roddie Bryan were each convicted for murdering Arbery who was unarmed after pursuing him in February last year and claiming without evidence he had been involved in a spate of burglaries in their neighborhood

The verdict was announced after two weeks of testimony and evidence in the closely watched trial 

Travis McMichael was the only one of the three men to take the stand during trial and had argued he shot Arbery with his shotgun in selfdefense The defendants said they had tried to enact a citizens arrest on Arbery an argument disputed by the prosecution who said they had no probable cause to detain Arbery a frequent jogger in the neighborhood

Although the case became an emblem of racial injustice and bias in the US criminal justice system to many prosecutors ultimately left the issue of racism outside the case 

In closing arguments lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski made just a passing reference to the allegations of racial bias stating they the defendants made their decision to attack Ahmaud Arbery in their driveways because he was a Black man running down the street

But allegations of racism and intentional bias surrounded the court case throughout

Aid workers have issued a stark warning about the state of migrant crossings in the Mediterranean with more than 75 people feared dead off the coast of Libya

Their boat capsized in stormy seas while attempting to reach Europe in one of the deadliest shipwrecks this year according to the UN

Fifteen survivors were rescued by local fishers and brought to the port of Zuwara in northwestern Libya They said there were about 92 people onboard the vessel when the incident took place on 17 November Most of those who died came from subSaharan Africa

According to aid workers people smugglers are sending hundreds of people to sea this autumn careless of stormy weather Many of the journeys ended in tragedy

Last week 10 people were found dead in the lower deck of a severely overcrowded wooden boat off the coast of Libya Mdecins Sans Frontires MSF reported

Abdoulaye one of the last survivors to leave the boat barely had the time to understand what had happened to his fellow travellers before the MSF rescuers took his arm and helped him into the rescue lifeboat

Let me see their bodies he told the team These are my brothers We come from the same place we went through Libya together I need to tell their families they are dead Please let me see them

An estimated 1300 people have died or gone missing while attempting to cross the central Mediterranean so far this year In April more than 120 died in a single incident In comparison between January to November last year at least 575 people were thought to have died in the central Mediterranean according to the UN migration agency IOM

The volunteerrun Mediterranean rescue hotline Alarm Phone said the most recent shipwreck was a consequence of a lethal European migration policy that does everything to prevent people from reaching Europe and that does nothing to prevent ongoing mass drowning along its borders

It added It is just a matter of time until we hear about the next shipwreck and the one after that We need radical political change otherwise the Mediterranean will remain a liquid graveyard

If there is no treasure it means there is no history if there is no history there is no nation

Do you agree with Ethiopias ambassador to the UK

Teferi Meles said this when  after a century and a half hidden in private collections  13 Ethiopian artefacts stolen by British forces were finally returned home following months of negotiations

The collection includes a ceremonial crown a shield a handwritten prayer book crosses a necklace and a set of silverembossed horn drinking cups

The treasures were formally handed over two months ago at a ceremony in London but were unwrapped at Ethiopias national museum on Saturday

These particular artefacts were taken in 1868 following the battle of Maqdala between the British and Ethiopian empires Some of the objects had been offered in an auction by a private seller in the UK this June

In 1868 around 13000 British soldiers were sent into the Ethiopian formerly Abyssinian mountains to capture the mountain capital of Maqdala Some 700 Abyssinians died and more than a thousand were injured in the siege When Emperor Tewodros II saw he had lost he shot himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria The fortress was looted and razed to the ground It is said to have taken 15 elephants and 200 mules to remove the loot

Ethiopia said it was the largest such repatriation of artefacts to the country with Melesse saying it is of huge significance

But this is just the start The Ethiopian government is still fighting for Britain to return the remains of Prince Alemayehu as well as sacred wooden and stone tabots or tablets which represent the Ark of the Covenant The tabots are housed in the British Museum in London which is notorious for housing artefacts stolen during the colonial era

Calls have long been mounting across the African continent for Western countries to return the thousands of artefacts stolen during European colonial rule Share your thoughts in the comments section

Sea turtles on the sandy shores of western Senegal have made a rapid comeback because of quieter beaches during the coronavirus pandemic

With less activity and less light from the nearby hotels more turtles have come to lay their eggs on the beach in the villages like Guro 

Fifteen turtles nested on Guros beach last season up from just two the previous year 

Turtle nests are appearing in greater numbers than ever before along West Africas shores 

Increased fishing tourism and construction have deterred Senegals three species of turtle all of which appear on International Union for Conservation of Natures IUCN Red List

And while they have appeared in greater numbers than ever before due to the Covid pandemic all species of turtles in Senegal and in the world remain threatened and endangered 

Charlotte Thomas a turtle researcher at the Oceanium marine conservation organisation in Dakar says turtles play the role of ocean cleaner They regulate marine algae by eating them and marine algae is depended upon by lot on other species such as tuna lobster and shrimp If these turtles were to disappear that would create an imbalance in the food chain and threaten the entire ecosystem

They say that grandchildren are lifes greatest joy and now the first study to examine grandmothers brain function has suggested they may be more emotionally connected to their grandkids than to their offspring

The research led by Prof James Rilling an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta Georgia recruited 50 women with at least one grandchild aged between three and 12 and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan their brains as they looked at photos of that child the childs parents and images of an unrelated child and adult

What really jumps out is the activation in areas of the brain associated with emotional empathy Rilling said That suggests that grandmothers are geared toward feeling what their grandchildren are feeling when they interact with them If their grandchild is smiling theyre feeling the childs joy And if their grandchild is crying theyre feeling the childs pain and distress

In contrast when the grandmothers looked at images of their adult child slightly different brain areas tended to be activated those associated with cognitive empathy This could indicate that they were trying to cognitively understand their adult child rather than experiencing a more direct emotional connection

Rilling believes this could possibly help to explain the experience many grownup children have of their parents often seeming more excited to see their grandchildren than them

Young children have likely evolved traits to be able to manipulate not just the maternal brain but the grandmaternal brain An adult child doesnt have the same cute factor so they may not the same emotional response

The findings published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B support the idea that there may be a global caregiving system in the brain that is activated in mothers who have been examined in separate studies fathers and grandmothers Rilling now hopes to study grandfathers and other childcare providers to see how they compare

The performing circus animal who died after years of cruelty has played a key role in helping to change the law in France

In new animal rights legislation the countrys parliament has voted to end the use of wild animals in live circus shows

Performances of wild animals such as lions tigers or bears will be prohibited in two years and owning them outlawed in seven years under the wideranging law passed on Thursday

The new regulations once signed into law by the president Emmanuel Macron will also ban live dolphin shows and mink farming

The legislation has been praised as a historic step in the animal rights combat for a country that lags behind around 20 European nations that have either banned or heavily restricted the use of animals for entertainment

Public opinion in Europe has moved decisively against animal circuses once a popular form of family entertainment following revelations about cruel treatment and campaigning from rights groups

As well as the measures targeting circuses the new law will raise the maximum penalty for mistreating animals to five years in prison and a fine of 75000 euros 85000 and will tighten restrictions on the sale of pets

Several events in France in recent years have added momentum for the ban In 2017 a female tiger named Mevy was gunned down in Paris in the name of public safety after escaping from her enclosure at the Cirque BormannMoreno

The death in 2019 of the sickly performing bear Mischa who had been rescued from animal trainers after reportedly being kept in conditions akin to a medieval jail has also been credited with swaying public opinion

A jury has found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all charges after he shot dead two people and injured a third at an antiracism protest in Kenosha Wisconsin last year

Rittenhouse killed Joseph Rosenbaum 36 and Anthony Huber 26 and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz 27 when he shot them with an assault rifle as he roamed the streets of Kenosha with other selfdescribed militia during protests in August 2020 after a white police officer shot a Black man Jacob Blake in the back

The trial was seen as a test case for the US as it seemed to illustrate the very different attitudes of law enforcement when confronted with armed white militia groups or antiracism protests such as Black Lives Matter

Rittenhouse quickly became a cause celebre for some conservatives who raised money for his legal fees and sought to portray him as someone who stood up to rioters

The judge in the case Bruce Schroeder also became a source of controversy with a bombastic style outrageous comments during the trial and attitudes some observers said betrayed sympathy with the defense

Schroeder ruled before the trial that the men Rittenhouse shot could not be called victims by prosecutors Defense attorneys could however use such labels as arsonists or looters if they could justify it

Prosecutors argued forcefully that Schroeder was establishing a double standard as the case unfolded
Amazon deforestation in Brazil has soar 22 in the past year to a 15year high the governments annual report has shown undercutting president Jair Bolsonaros assurances that the country is curbing illegal logging

Brazils space research agency INPE recorded 13235sq km 5110 square miles of deforestation in the worlds largest rainforest in satellite data from August 2020 to July 2021

Thats nearly 17 times the size of New York City nine times the size of Delhi and 85 times the size of London

At the UN climate summit in Glasgow this month Brazils government brought forward a pledge to end illegal deforestation by two years to 2028 a target that would require aggressive annual reductions in the destruction

Though Bolsonaro a farright former army captain still calls for more mining and commercial farming in protected parts of the rainforest

The new INPE report showed deforestation rising in each of the last four cycles  a first for the data series since at least 2000 The government went to Cop26 knowing the deforestation data and hid it said Brazilian advocacy group Climate Observatory

Brazil as home to the majority of the worlds largest rainforest was seen as crucial to that global pact The Amazons trees absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet

But some scientists warn that if enough of the forest is destroyed it could cross a tipping point dry out and turn into savannah That would release huge amounts of carbon virtually ensuring the world cannot hit the targets laid out to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis

In a huge victory for Indias farmers Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced he will repeal three contentious farm laws that prompted a year of protests and unrest

The laws introduced in September 2020 deregulated the sector allowing farmers to sell produce to buyers beyond the governmentregulated wholesale markets that guarantee growers a minimum price But farmers said the reforms put their livelihoods at risk and gave private corporations control over the pricing of their crops

Modi introduced the laws in a bid to overhaul the agriculture sector which still employs about 60 of Indias workforce but is riddled with issues of poverty debt and inefficiency

However they quickly became a major source of contention among Indias millions of farmers who accused the government of passing the legislation without consultation

After the government refused to repeal the laws last year hundreds of thousands of farmers marched to Delhis borders to protest against what they called the black laws

They were met on the way with barricades teargas and water cannon and set up protest camps along the main highways into the capital

The farmers have remained at the Delhi borders ever since maintaining one of the most sustained challenges to the Modi government even through the harsh winters baking summers and the brutal second wave of Covid19

The protests turned violent in February when the farmers stormed into the centre of Delhi and briefly took over the historic Red Fort Unions say more than 600 farmers died during the protests

Previously the Modi government had said they would not bow down to pressure from the farmers However is thought that the decision to rollback the laws is tied to upcoming crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab where farmers make up a key proportion of the vote bank and farmers unions hold significant power and influence

During the surprise announcement on Friday Modi said he was repealing the laws because he lamented that the government had been unable to convince farmers The move is one of the most significant concessions made by his government

Do you think mask wearing should still be required

According to a new global study which is the first of its kind wearing a mask is the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid reducing incidence by 53

While vaccines are safe and effective and saving lives around the world experts say most do not confer 100 protection most countries have not vaccinated everyone and it is not yet known if jabs will prevent future transmission of emerging coronavirus variants

Globally Covid cases exceeded 250 million this month The virus is still infecting 50 million people worldwide every 90 days due to the highly transmissible Delta variant with thousands dying each day

Now a systematic review and meta analysis of nonpharmaceutical interventions has found for the first time that mask wearing social distancing and hand washing are all effective measures at curbing cases  with mask wearing the most effective

Researchers say the results highlight the need to continue mask wearing social distancing and hand washing alongside vaccine programmes

Mask wearing was adopted by many countries at the start of the pandemic but nearly two years later many have now dropped some or all their original requirements

The Dutch government this month decided to reimpose the mandatory wearing of face masks in an effort to slow the latest spike in infections

Democratic congresswoman Alexandria OcasioCortez blasted House minority leader Kevin McCarthy for failing to condemn the violent tweet of fellow Republican Paul Gosar ahead of a censure vote against him

Earlier this month Arizona congressman Gosar posted a video from his congressional Twitter account asking Any anime fans out there
It included a video which has since been removed depicting the Republican lawmaker killing OcasioCortez and swinging two swords at President Joe Biden

Gosar a loyalist of Donald Trump and one of the most farright members of Congress sat in the chamber and listened as his colleagues yesterday voted to censure him  the harshest form of punishment the chamber can hand out short of expulsion

This is not about me This is not about Representative Gosar OcasioCortez said in a speech before the vote This is about what we are willing to accept  What is so hard about saying that this is wrong

McCarthy and other Republican leaders have refused to publicly condemn Gosar for sharing the video and urged their caucus to oppose the sanction

The censure was last night approved on a largely partyline vote with all Democrats and just two Republicans  Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Congressman Adam Kinzinger of
Illinois  voting in favor

Individuals could be stripped of their British citizenship without warning under a proposed rule change quietly added to the nationality and borders bill

Clause 9  Notice of decision to deprive a person of citizenship  of the controversial nationality and borders bill which was updated earlier this month exempts the government from having to give notice if it is not reasonably practicable to do so or in the interests of national security diplomatic relations or otherwise in the public interest

Critics say removing citizenship as in the case of Shamima Begum who fled Britain as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in Syria is already a contentious power and scrapping the requirement for notice would make the home secretary Priti Patels powers even more draconian

Frances Webber the vicechair of the Institute of Race Relations said This amendment sends the message that certain citizens despite being born and brought up in the UK and having no other home remain migrants in this country  It builds on previous measures to strip Britishborn dual nationals who are mostly from ethnic minorities of citizenship and to do it while they are abroad measures used mainly against British Muslims It unapologetically flouts international human rights obligations and basic norms of fairness

Maya Foa the director of the charity Reprieve said This clause would give Priti Patel unprecedented power to remove your citizenship in secret without even having to tell you and effectively deny you an appeal  This once again shows how little regard this government has for the rule of law

The Home Office said British citizenship is a privilege not a right Deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves very high harm The nationality and borders bill will amend the law so citizenship can be deprived where it is not practicable to give notice for example if there is no way of communicating with the person

Indigenous communities facing an upsurge in land grabs water shortages and human rights violations as a result of the Cop26 deal have accused world leaders of sacrificing them in order to postpone meaningful climate action and shield corporate profits

The leaders pushing for marketbased solutions and the commodification of our Mother Earth are signing a death sentence said Thomas Joseph from the Hoopa tribe located in California 

The Glasgow deal creates a regulated global carbon trading market  a move widely supported by the worlds biggest polluters including the US  allowing countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying credits representing emission cuts by others

Critics warn that carbon markets incentivise countries and corporations to offset  rather than cut  emissions responsible for global heating by investing in socalled green energy projects like biofuel monocrops and hydroelectric dams which are linked to environmental destruction forced displacement arbitrary arrests and even murder

In addition such carbon credit schemes often rely on sequestering land forests and rivers relied on by Indigenous and local communities for food water medicine and spiritual traditions and there is little evidence to suggest they lead to a genuine drop in emissions

In fact global emissions have continued to soar since carbon credits were first incentivized under the voluntary Kyoto protocol in 1997 as have abuses against Indigenous and rural communities defending land rights and natural resources

Now Indigenous communities fear whats coming next as the scope and scale of the new global carbon market  introduced in article 6 of the Paris accords  is much wider Far more countries and industries including the US Saudi Arabia and civil aviation will participate

Andrea Xieu a spokesperson for the Mexican collective Futuros Indgenas Indigenous Futures described the deal as an embarrassment that illustrated the murky influence of fossil fuel companies in Glasgow

Osaka says she is shocked that Peng has gone missing shortly after revealing she has been sexually abused She added Censorship is never OK at any cost I hope Peng Shuai and her family are safe and OK Im in shock at the current situation and Im sending love and light her way Osaka is one of many tennis players who have expressed concern over Pengs silence

The Chinese government has not responded to the allegations A spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs told reporters he was not aware of the situation saying I have not heard of the issue you raised This is not a diplomatic question

Online abuse is still rife almost two years after presenter Caroline Flacks death her friend and fellow broadcaster Laura Whitmore has said

Speaking to the Guardian restaurant critic Grace Dent on the Comfort Eating podcast Whitmore said not much had changed since Flack took her own life in February 2020 The presenter died following her arrest on charges of assaulting her boyfriend Lewis Burton which led to intense public and media scrutiny

thewhitmore who took over from Flack in presenting ITVs Love Island said Its hard because you would hope after something as shocking that you know and something as horrific as what happened  I cant even believe how long ago it is now does it still feel so fresh  that some change will happen

Flacks mother has previously said the media have failed to learn the lessons of her daughters death and must take responsibility for coverage of public figures struggling with mental health problems Christine Flack said she hoped the outlets that wrote all the horrible things about Caroline would take away that before they print anything at least find out if its true Its someones life its someones child its someones sister or brother 

In her new interview with gracedent Whitmore added that There are certain papers I refuse to work with And because of that they will come for me and its hard And its hard because I refuse to do an interview with them because of how theyve treated friends of mine in the past or how theyve written about them And until they change until they apologise or until they become better Im not going to work with them But because of that Im fair game

Azeem Rafiq fought back tears as he told British lawmakers of the racist abuse he faced across two spells at Yorkshire cricket club

azeemrafiq30 told MPs Pretty early on at the club I joined a dressing room full of my heroes  And it was just the most surreal moment for me

Pretty early on me and other people from an Asian background  there were comments such as youll sit over there near the toilets elephant washers The word Paki was used constantly And there just seemed to be an acceptance in the institution from the leaders and no one ever stamped it out

Rafiq first alleged racial harassment and bullying against the county last September with the club launching an investigation soon afterwards However their handling of it has been heavily criticised They finally published summary findings of the investigation this September and while the investigation found there was no question Rafiq had been subjected to racial harassment and bullying no individuals faced disciplinary action

Today Rafiq spoke in detail about former England batter and onetime Yorkshire captain Gary Ballance Rafiq said Ballance racially abused him on a preseason tour in 2017 Gary Ballance walks over and goes Why are you talking to him You know hes a Paki This happened in front of teammates It happened in front of coaching staff

Rafiq went on opening up about how he and his wife lost their unborn son in 2017 and detailed the inhuman treatment he received by certain people at Yorkshire

Rafiq who is a Muslim also described his harrowing first experience of alcohol at the age of 15 I got pinned down at my local cricket club and had red wine poured down my throat literally down my throat he said  I wasnt perfect there are things I did which I felt I had to do to achieve my dreams I deeply regret that but it has nothing to do with racism

When I spoke I should have been listened to The game as a whole has a problem with listening to the victim There is no yeah but with racism there is no two sides to racism

Thousands of children have returned to their classrooms after more than 18 months of home study in the Philippines thought to be the last country to reopen schools since the start of the pandemic

On Monday morning 120 schools began onsite lessons through a pilot project Footage by the broadcaster ABS CBN showed children at a school in Alaminos line up outside to take their temperatures complete a health form and wash their hands before entering class

Students who wore face masks and face shields sat at desks that were partially covered by plastic windows

To reduce mixing children are required to eat lunch at their desks and are only allowed to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom

In September Unicef identified six countries where schools have remained almost completely closed between March 2020 and 30 July 2021 the Philippines Bangladesh Venezuela Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Panama which gradually reopened schools from 31 May Of these countries the Philippines is the last to begin resuming inperson teaching

On top of school closures children in the Philippines have also faced tough lockdown restrictions including rules banning them from playing outside or in public spaces

Until this month children in the capital Manila have been barred from going to indoor restaurants shops and arcades

Education advocates said the prolonged closure of schools has had a major impact on childrens development and on their mental health

President Rodrigo Duterte said in June 2020 that inperson classes would not return until a vaccine was available in the country

Roughly a third of the population has been fully vaccinated and the country recently began offering vaccination for children aged 12 to 17

Coronavirus cases in the Philippines have fallen since a peak in September with the country now confirming an average of 2065 cases over the past seven days according to Our World in Data

My brother and his wife defended the environment now theyre dead  by Claudelice dos Santos from Maraba Brazil

When Z Claudio and Maria were murdered it was as if the world had vanished from beneath our feet 

We knew my brother and sisterinlaw were being threatened for defending the environment  but we never imagined theyd actually be killed The state knew about all the violence their community was suffering from landgrabbers and loggers and nothing was done

Ten years later it still hurts so much Each morning I remember Every day my mother cries But we knew we wouldnt find peace until there was real justice So eventually we decided that rather than just mourning we had to fight

We were part of the struggle for social and environmental justice long before Z Claudio and Maria were killed But when youre driven by pain and fear and above all injustice it makes you bolder 

So I embraced my fear my despair and my pain Some days I couldnt even get out of bed for fear of being shot because of the death threats I was getting Or because I was consumed by the pain of losing Z and Maria I overcame all this because we believe change is possible

Whats crucial is our capacity for resilience And our ability to stand up and say Ill fight Ill denounce things Ill ask the international community to pay attention I will not remain silent

Everything Z and Maria fought against while they were alive continues the killings the destruction of the forest

This is a struggle that will never end because just when you think things couldnt get any worse along comes Brazils president Jair Bolsonaro Never in my worst nightmares could I have imagined wed face such regression

Weve reached the limit of everything Natures limit The limit of our own strength But we are still alive and we will continue to resist

Ella Daish a British environmental activist is stepping up her campaign against singleuse plastics in period products by calling on the worlds bestselling manufacturer of tampons to make greener alternatives

The founder of the EndPeriodPlastic campaign is today going to the European headquarters of Tampaxmaker Procter  Gamble in Geneva to present executives with a giant tampon applicator made of 1200 discarded Tampax applicators found littering British waterways rivers and beaches

After a call on social media Daish asked people across the UK to send her plastic tampon applicators they found polluting their local environment She was sent boxes filled to the brim with discarded plastic applicators found in all parts of the UK from the River Clyde to the Isles of Scilly

elladaish said she had met more than 10 retailers and manufacturers since launching her campaign in 2018 but US multinational Procter  Gamble had been the least responsive I am just fed up  despite being the global leader of these products they are not doing anything They are falling behind and every other manufacturer and retailer Ive met is moving in the right direction

A spokesperson for Procter  Gamble said We wholeheartedly agree with Ella that plastics do not belong on beaches and were working to address this in line with European waste infrastructure  

The company added that they made reusable period products as well as tampons with cardboard applicators We know that periods are a highly personal topic and whats right for some is not necessarily right for all Our goal is to find a solution where people with periods dont have to compromise quality while also having the absolute least impact on the earth

In 2019 the EU passed a law banning singleuse plastic cutlery plates straws stirrers and cotton buds which came into effect in July 2021 The law didnt ban the use of plastics in tampons pads and applicators but requires companies to mark these products as containing plastic with information about how to dispose of them correctly

They were drugged and asphyxiated and their house set on fire

The murder was committed by their handyman who was jailed for life with a 34year minimum term

Its their portrait on the cover of this gallery

They are two of the 118 women in the UK last year found in a court of law to be victims of femicide

Femicide is not just homicide of women by men its about how and why women are killed and how this is different from when men are killed

To help raise awareness the artist Henny Beaumont has painted portraits of each woman  and where there is no photo she has painted flowers instead

On International Womens Day in March jessphillipsmp read the names of 118 women killed by men that year The only name Id heard of was Sarah Everard said hennybeaumontillustration

The dangerously high environmental cost of fast fashion is impossible to ignore in these images

They show at least 39000 tonnes of discarded clothes dumped in Chiles Atacama desert Thats equal in weight to about 85000 grand pianos

The items are largely leftovers from the fast fashion industry according to the news agency AFP which published these images from September this week

It found that about 59000 tons of clothing end up at the port in Chile every year Of that at least 39000 tons was moved into landfills in the desert

This clothing arrives from all over the world said Alex Carreno a former employee in the ports import area

He said that as no one paid the necessary tariffs to take it away what is not sold to Santiago nor sent to other countries stays in the free zone

Franklin Zepeda the founder of EcoFibra a company that makes insulation panels using discarded clothing said The problem is that the clothing is not biodegradable and has chemical products so it is not accepted in the municipal landfills

Zepeda whose firm has been using textile waste to create its thermal and acoustic building insulators since 2018 said he wanted to stop being the problem and start being the solution

According to the World Economic Forum the fashion industry produces 10 of all humanitys carbon emissions is the second largest consumer of water supplies and is the seventh largest economy in the world

It was wonderful to see so many family members and friends But I wanted to do it in less than a minute she said after the race where she recorded a time of 10295 a record for women in the 105 age category When someone pointed out that 102 is less than her age and asked if that made her feel better Hawkins answered No

The retired teacher is no stranger to athletic excellence She started competing at the National Senior Games when she was 80 specialising in cycling time trials and won several gold medals She eventually ended her cycling career saying that there wasnt anyone left my age to compete with

When she turned 100 she took up sprinting In 2017 she set the 100m world record for women over the age of 100 with a time of 3962 When her record was broken in September by Diane Friedman Hawkins decided to compete in a new age category

This is what these climate activists from Extinction Rebellion thought of Australias commitments at the Cop26 climate summit

They dumped a huge pile of organic horse manure in front of Australias finance minister Simon Birminghams office on Friday morning

Dressed in hazmat suits they dropped the dung in front of signs reading Glasgow was a shitshow and your gas stinks and finished the display with an Australian flag that had climate pariah written on it

Weve come to deliver a little bit of a message to Mr Birmingham as our representative to take back to the federal government a woman on the live video said We are currently in a climate code red and all weve witnessed lately is Glasgows sht show

We have left a nice message of some very organic horse manure which hopefully senator Birmingham will feel quite at home with with all the sht thats been going around

In response Birmingham tweeted I hate to see unnecessary waste Any eager western suburbs gardeners are most welcome to help themselves to some spring fertiliser

Extinction Rebellion also hit out at Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying he has taken a weak nonbinding plan with no new policies or mandates to the summit

Its sad that climate change affects our language also says saraelvirak an activist from the Smi group  the only indigenous people within the European Union area

We spoke with the 21yearold about how the climate crisis is affecting her community who depend on cold snowy winters to keep up their livelihood in reindeer herding

As the pivotal climate summit Cop26 comes to an end Indigenous activists have fought to have their voices heard but have still been drowned out by the bureaucracy and structural barriers which meant they had less access to the summit and its platform

Ita Mendoza said an Indigenous land defender from Mexico said The Cop is a big business a continuation of colonialism where people come not to listen to us but to make money from our land and natural resources

This discovery made it one of the happiest days of lockdown

A new species of dinosaur with an extremely large nose has been identified by a retired GP who spent lockdown rummaging through boxes of ancient bones

Jeremy Lockwood who is studying for a PhD at the University of Portsmouth set himself the task of cataloguing every bone from an iguanodon  a type of dinosaur  discovered on the Isle of Wight

As he sorted the bones from the collections of the Natural History Museum in London and the Dinosaur Isle museum on the Isle of Wight he discovered a specimen with a unique bulbous nasal bone

After four years of unpacking and studying boxes of bones he began reconstructing the skull of a specimen that had been in storage since 1978 and found several striking features that set it apart

The number of teeth was a sign Lockwood said Mantellisaurus has 23 or 24 but this has 28 It also had a bulbous nose whereas the other species have very straight noses Altogether these and other small differences made it very obviously a new species

The herbivorous dinosaur was about eight metres in length and weighed about 900kg

Lockwood who was also involved in the discovery of another new species known as the hell heron said the latest discoveries showed British dinosaurs were not done and dusted

I think we could be on to a bit of a renaissance he added

A train driver in Japan is suing his employer after it docked 43 28p from his wages over a oneminute delay that he claims was not his fault

West Japan Railway Company JR West said it withheld the tiny sum by applying its strict no work no pay principle over the incident which occurred in June last year

The dispute arose after the driver who had been scheduled to move an empty train to a depot at Okayama station in western Japan realised he was waiting at the wrong platform

His mistake held up the driver transfer at the correct platform by oneminute and caused a further oneminute delay to the trains arrival at the depot according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper

JR West said it was entitled to dock the drivers pay as he had not been working during the mixup

The driver however told Okayama district court that the delay was caused by human error and that he should not have been considered absent from work adding that there was no disruption to train timetables

He is now seeking the 43 plus 13 overtime as well as 22m damages for the mental anguish caused by his employers decision the newspaper said

The case is a reminder of the Japanese railway networks enviable record on punctuality with even very brief delays prompting repeated apologies to passengers

Will they let us die here

Those are the words of Hiwa the father of twoyearold Arias He has been rationing the amount of water he can give his son by using a bottle cap as refugees and migrants continue to be stranded on the PolishBelarusian border

According to activists Hiwa and his family are Kurds fleeing discrimination in Iraq Belarus wont allow us to return to Minsk Poland wont let us into the country They are using us  I think that Belarus is not giving us food or water to force Poland into helping Hiwa said in a message sent to Polish campaigners and posted on Instagram by majakstasko

At least eight people have died since the beginning of the humanitarian and political crisis with Belarus which is accused of deliberately provoking a new refugee crisis in Europe by organising the movement of people from the Middle East to Minsk and promising them safe passage to the EU in revenge for the sanctions Brussels has imposed on its authoritarian regime Poland which has deployed approximately 20000 border police has been accused in turn of violently pushing thousands of people back across the border

Hiwa said that he has been burning dry wood to keep his wife and son warm during the cold nights and the family have been forced to ration their dwindling water supply

It is silent and all you can hear is the terrifying wailing of a child I dont know how to sleep What will happen tomorrow I hope that I can provide my child with a different future than my life I am afraid for them I want them to be healthy nothing else Hiwa said in a message sent at 225 am

The true numbers of those who have died and are attempting to cross the border are hard to estimate as the Polish government has declared a state of emergency in areas surrounding the Belarus border and is refusing humanitarian aid workers journalists and EU observers access to the area

These surreal and striking images were taken by emiliomorenatti on the Spanish island of La Palma where the Cumbre Vieja volcano has been erupting for over two months

The images show homes playgrounds and even graves completely covered by ash 

The volcano erupted on 19 September and is showing few signs of abating so far after destroying over 2000 buildings and forcing over 7000 people to leave their homes

The Spanish government has pledged 225 million euros 192 million in aid to help La Palma residents

The recent volcanic eruption is the first since 1971 on La Palma which has a population of 85000 and part of the Canary Islands archipelago off northwest Africa

The tension of not knowing whether the slowmoving molten rock will eventually entomb their homes farmland and businesses is taking a toll on local people There is already a certain degree of despondency and desperation waiting for the volcano to subside said the mayor of Tazacorte Juan Miguel Rodrguez

Volcanic ash can damage peoples airways lungs and eyes The local government has urged residents in affected areas to avoid going outside and only do so wearing masks and goggles

Experts said that predicting when the eruption will end is difficult because lava ash and gases emerging to the surface are a reflection of complex geological activity happening deep down the earth and far from the reach of currently available technology

There is no way out of this climate emergency without the empowerment of women that is the resounding message from many leaders and campaigners at Cop26

Speaking to delegates at the climate summit Angelica Ponce executive director of the Plurinational Authority for Mother Earth in Bolivia said The world as designed by men has destroyed many things The world should begin thinking like women If it was designed by a woman it would end violence against women and children

We want to be in the corridors of power and take part in decisions at international level to end this struggle of climate justice she said As Indigenous women we live daybyday the cruel reality of climate change in our land

Women and girls around the world suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate breakdown as they are on average poorer less educated and more dependent on subsistence farming A UN report found 80 of those displaced by the climate emergency are women

The focus on gender equality yesterday saw many more Indigenous women and politicians including Scotlands first minister Nicola Sturgeon and Nancy Pelosi speaker of the US House of Representatives demand increased investment

Sturgeon said When world leaders gathered here last week of the 120 or so a tiny minority were women  that needs to change and it needs to change quickly There is no doubt we must ensure that climate change is a feminist issue But women are not pleading to be supported Were demanding to be empowered

Pelosi said If I ruled the world the one thing that I would do is invest in the education of women When women succeed the world succeeds

Climaterelated events will prevent at least 4 million girls in lowerincome countries from completing their education in 2021 he said citing a Malala Fund report On current trends the climate crisis will contribute to at least 125 million girls not completing their education each year the report said

Do you think this is a game changer

Lawmakers in Portugal have passed new rules which say companies must avoid contacting workers outside office hours as well as contribute to expenses resulting from remote working such as electricity and internet bills

Under the new labour laws  passed by parliament as a result of the explosion in homeworking  employers could face fines for contacting staff after work except under exceptional circumstances

Portugals ruling Socialist Party have also decided that companies should be forbidden from monitoring their staff while they work at home

The new rules wont however apply to companies with fewer than ten employees

Speaking to the Web Summit Conference in Lisbon last week Portugals minister of labour and social security said The pandemic has accelerated the need to regulate what needs to be regulated she said

Telework can be a game changer if we profit from the advantages and reduce the disadvantages

We consider Portugal one of the best places in the world for these digital nomads and remote workers to choose to live in we want to attract them to Portugal she told the Web Summit audience

The weight of about 2000 double decker buses has leaked into the ocean new research has revealed and its all plastic waste from the Covid19 pandemic

The 26000 tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste consists of personal protective equipment PPE such as masks and gloves

The pandemic has led to an increased demand for singleuse plastics that intensifies pressure on an already outofcontrol global plastic waste problem said Yiming Peng and Peipei Wu from Nanjing University the authors of the study published in the online journal PNAS

The released plastics can be transported over long distances in the ocean encounter marine wildlife and potentially lead to injury or even death they added

A study in March presented the first case of a fish entrapped in a medical glove encountered during a canal cleanup in Leiden the Netherlands In Brazil a PFF2 protective mask was found in the stomach of a dead Magellanic penguin

Since the beginning of the pandemic an estimated 84m tonnes of plastic waste has been generated from 193 countries according to the new report published on Monday

The Chinese study found that 46 of the mismanaged plastic waste came from Asia due to the high level of maskwearing by individuals there followed by Europe 24 and North and South America 22

Peng and Wu said their research suggested 874 of the excess waste was from hospitals rather than from individual use PPE usage by individuals contributed only 76 of the total while packaging and test kits accounted for 47 and 03 respectively

The scientists predicted that by the end of the century almost all pandemicassociated plastics will end up on either the seabed or on beaches

Do you think this is fair

As Singapore grapples with a surge in cases the government has announced it will no longer pay the Covid19 medical bills for people unvaccinated by choice

The full Covid medical costs for all Singaporeans is currently covered as well as permanent residents and longterm visa holders unless they test positive soon after returning home from overseas

However from 8 December the government said it will start charging unvaccinated Covid patients who make up a sizeable majority of those who require intensive inpatient care and disproportionately contribute to the strain on our healthcare resources

Covidrelated medical bills will still be paid for people who arent eligible for a vaccine The government said it will also foot the bill for individuals who are partially vaccinated until 31 December giving them time to get a second dose

Singapore has among the highest coverage rates in the world with 85 of the eligible population fully vaccinated Yet the city state is struggling with rising Covid infections and last month warned its healthcare system was at risk of being overwhelmed by surging cases

It came a day after the country expanded quarantinefree travel as part of a shift in its approach to dealing with the pandemic

The prime minister Lee Hsien Loong previously said the global business hub could not remain closed indefinitely and Singapore has moved from a zerotolerance strategy with lockdowns and closed borders to living with Covid19

On 8 November the country reported 2470 new cases and 14 deaths The ministry of heath said 67 Covid cases were critically ill in intensive care

What time do you go to bed

A new study suggests there may also be an optimal time to nod off  at least when it comes to heart health Not too early and not too late with the sweet spot being between 10pm and 11pm

The research published in the journal European Heart Journal  Digital Health collected data from more than 88000 participants who wore wristbased devices for seven days to explore whether there was an association with the time that participants fell asleep at night

It concluded that going to sleep at 10pm or shortly after is associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with falling asleep earlier or later at night

The study cannot prove that early or late bedtimes contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease though  not least since when people fall asleep may be linked to other health conditions or behaviours such as staying out late and drinking that may be linked to cardiovascular disease risk Moreover the research did not look closely at the quality of the participants sleep only length and timing

However Dr David Plans the head of research at Huma Therapeutics and senior lecturer at the University of Exeter who coauthored the study said one possibility was that early or late bedtimes might result in individuals missing important cues such as morning daylight which help to reset the bodys internal clock each day

If the body clock is not reset properly over a long period of time that misalignment of behaviours and the circadian clock increases inflammation and can impair glucose regulation both of which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease Plans said

The study has further limitations including that it is based only on data from adults aged 43 to 79 and participants of the UK Biobank  a database of genetic and lifestyle information that researchers are using to investigate myriad health issues  are predominantly white

Plans said further research with more participants is needed to examine the findings adding there was not enough evidence at present to prescribe a particular bedtime to the public

Overstone Kondowes historic election as Malawis first MP with albinism has been hailed as a giant step forward in the protection of human rights of people with albinism in Malawi and Africa as whole

In the southern African country and many other parts of the continent people with the hereditary lack of pigmentation in the skin hair and eyes face severe discrimination and physical attacks  meaning many children often do not go to school

Both Malawi and neighbouring Tanzania have a long history of people with albinism being killed for their body parts which fetch high prices as they are used in rituals witchcraft and are believed to bring good luck

But Kondowe who took his seat in the new parliament on Monday hopes his election has set a precedent in a country where 134636 people are living with albinism The victory is a clear demonstration that people are changing their altitudes he said

The 42yearold son of a teacher grew up in a village without any help to ease the pain in his sunsensitive skin or glasses to aid his poor eyesight

Despite struggling to see what was written on the blackboard Kondowe worked his way through school and university to achieve highlevel positions in both the government and in nongovernmental organisations

Kondowe a former president of Malawis Association of People with Albinism APAM has said that although attacks for body parts had been reduced thanks to a handful of highprofile prosecutions there was still a long way to go  and that he plans to work for legislation to protect all people with disabilities

Ikponwosa Ero a former UN adviser on albinism said she was elated by Kondowes election which she called a giant step forward Meanwhile Charles Mailosi 29 a teacher from Lilongwe who has albinism said he was excited by Kondowes victory

This is a powerful sign that Malawians are accepting us he said

It gives me courage that I can achieve greater things in life and that people can trust me

Tuvalus foreign minister has recorded a speech for the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow  standing kneedeep in seawater to highlight how the lowlying Pacific Island nation is on the frontline of the climate crisis

Images of Simon Kofe standing in a suit and tie at a lectern set up in the sea with his trouser legs rolled up have been shared widely on social media drawing attention to the fact that Tuvalu is one of the countries considered most at risk of disappearing due to sea level rise

Before the Cop26 summit it emerged that onethird of Pacific small island states and territories would be unable to send any government figures for the talks in Scotland due to Covid19 travel restrictions

Many big polluters have vowed to intensify their carbon cuts over coming decades with some aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050 But Pacific Island leaders have demanded immediate action pointing out that the very survival of their lowlying countries is at stake

Picture your day before you started to read this what did you do

In every single moment  getting out of bed turning on a tap flicking the kettle switch  your brain was blasted with information

Each second the eyes will give the brain the equivalent of 10m bits binary digits of data The ears will take in an orchestra of sound waves Then theres our thoughts the average person researchers estimate will have more than 6000 a day To get anything done we have to filter out most of this data We have to focus

Focusing has felt particularly tough during the pandemic

Books are left halfread eyes wander away from Zoom calls conversations stall My inability to concentrate on anything  work reading cleaning cooking  without being distracted over the past 18 months has felt at times farcical

The good news We can learn to focus better but we need to think about attention differently It is not something we can just choose to do We have to train the brain like a muscle Specifically with short bursts of daily exercises

Dr Amishi Jha  a professor of cognitive and behavioural neuroscience at the University of Miami  has written a book called Peak Mind Find Your Focus Own Your Attention Invest 12 Minutes a Day a fourweek training programme based on her research showing how simple mindfulness exercises carried out by people with highdemand jobs such as soldiers elite athletes and emergency medics improve many aspects of cognitive and emotional health including strengthening our attention

She spoke to Guardian contributor and trainee psychotherapist Eleanor Morgan about five things we can do to focus better

These words were written by Brianna Rodriguezs family in a fundraising post for the 16yearolds funeral She was killed during a crush at rapper Travis Scotts Astroworld festival show in Texas

Eight people  aged from 14 to 27 years old  were killed and dozens more injured in what is one of the deadliest live music events in US history

About 50000 people were in the audience at NRG Park in Houston on Friday when the crowd started pushing towards the stage as Scott was performing triggering chaotic scenes

Details of the victims who died during the surge have begun to emerge 

Danish Baig 27 reportedly died while attempting to save his fiancee Franco Patino a student in Ohio and his friend Jacob Jurinek both 21 died after having saved up to go to the event together The youngest of five siblings Rudy Pena 23 also died His sister said he was the sweetest person and a big Travis Scott fan

Organisers and Scott are facing questions about why he continued performing when first responders were already dealing with a mass casualty event

A fan using the Instagram handle SeannaFaith gave a harrowing account of how their cries for help were apparently ignored by guards The rush of people became tighter and tighter  Breathing became something only a few were capable The rest were crushed or unable to breathe in the thick hot air the user wrote describing people falling to the ground like watching a Jenga tower topple Person after person were sucked down

Both Scott and the Canadian rapper Drake who joined Scotts headline set have been sued for having incited mayhem during the concert a law firm has confirmed Neither Scott or Drake have commented on the suit

In an earlier tweet posted on Saturday Scott said he was absolutely devastated by what took place He pledged to work together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need  and added that he could just not imagine the severity of the situation from the stage

How the climate crisis upended my life  by Vanessa Nieuwenhuizen in Samoa 

It was the day before we were supposed to fly to Australia for a family reunion and Christmas in 2012 so it was a very exciting day to start off with There was a cyclone due to hit Samoa It started to rain really heavily and by the afternoon we started seeing water rising just around the house

At around 430 I heard my husband screaming outside and I knew something was very wrong By the time I made it outside there was a massive gush of water coming towards our house like an inland tsunami

My husband yelled to grab the kids My baby was sitting on the toilet I grabbed him by the arm The water was rising so quickly that by the time we made it out of the house the water was up to our hips 

We have four children and so my husband and I had one child on each arm as we waded through the water There was one point where my husband and I looked at each other and in my anxious mind I thought please please Heavenly Father dont let us have to make a decision to let one of our children go

We all made it through thank goodness But the thought of having to let go of one of our children I wouldnt wish it upon any parent

We made it into the workshop and climbed the stairs towards the little storeroom Our entire house was gone our cars had been washed away big machines in our workshop that had been bolted to the ground had washed away  thats how strong the water was We stayed up in the storeroom for several hours wrapped in old dirty curtains to keep ourselves warm I remember thinking if we make it out alive how and where are we going to start all over again

We had an amazing life in Samoa but after we lost everything in that flash flood we decided to move to Australia Australia has been kind to us but as much as we say this is home Samoa will always be home I miss Samoa Every occasion my thoughts turn to home and I still cry

Morgan Howell is giving classic rocknroll singles new dimensions  by creating giant 3D paintings of them complete with crinkled sleeves

The painter hopes they will make people start reminiscing about a certain song and the role it has played in their life

Howells work covers records released between 1953 and 1984 before picture sleeves largely replaced the company sleeves  which he says gave every artist the same chance It was a level playing field David Bowie and some guy that youve never heard of were stuck in the same sleeve There were no fancy pictures or gimmicks  just the record bag

Before deciding on a song to cover Howell often buys multiple copies of a seveninch single from around the world  researching the song on different labels or from various countries He says a sticker or price label is always a bonus because it helps to tell a story

The music itself will always exist of course but that first moment it entered the world and how it was packaged does not The 45s are tucked away in collections and in dusty boxes No one sees them or thinks about what they represent

Did any of these pictures make you reminisce

If wine growers adapted relatively well to the Covid19 crisis last year they were now confronting a much greater problem than the pandemic climate change said director of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine OIV Paul Roca

World wine production is expected to fall to one of its lowest levels on record after harsh weather battered vineyards in Europes major wineproducing regions

The conditions severely impacted production in Italy Spain and France resulting in extremely low production volumes an international wine body has said

In the midst of the shortage demand is expected to recover to near levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic according to the International Organisation of Vine and Wine OIV

They said a drop in production in Italy Spain and France the worlds largest wine producers would outweigh what is forecast to be the highestever volume in the southern hemisphere

Vineyards in western Europe were hit by spring frosts while French producers also endured heavy rain hail and mildew disease

Global consumption trends were encouraging with firsthalf data suggesting a rebound despite ongoing disruption to tourism and hospitality linked to the coronavirus pandemic the OIV said

We still expect the global consumption to increase compared to 2020 Pau Roca the OIVs director general told reporters noting firsthalf trade data showed volumes above prepandemic levels

While there is no vaccine against climate change he said there are longterm solutions which will require major efforts in terms of sustainable practices for cultivating vines and producing wine He said adaptation was an urgent necessity for the industry

Marvels latest bigbudget adventure Eternals has been pulled from Saudi Arabia Qatar and Kuwait after Disney reportedly refused to cut a samesex kiss the first onscreen LGBTQ kiss in the franchise

According to the Hollywood Reporter the 200m movie will not be released in some countries in the Gulf region after being removed from local sites

The studio has yet to comment or confirm but sources claim that the reason is because of a kiss between Brian Tyree Henrys character Atlanta and his onscreen husband Little America played by Haaz Sleiman

Homosexuality is still illegal across much of the region and is punishable by death in both Saudi Arabia and Qatar A local cinema chain confirmed to the trade that the film was banned but had no explanation provided

In Singapore Eternals has become the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to gain an M18 certificate which restricts audiences to those aged 18 and older A spokesperson for the countrys Infocomm Media Development Authority confirmed that it was a result of homosexual references The film also contains a sex scene between two heterosexual characters

Director Chloe Zhao who won the Oscar for best director earlier this year for Nomadland spoke recently about her desire to not tweak any scenes to appease censors

Lebanese actor Sleiman who came out as gay in 2017 spoke about the importance of the scene at the films premiere Its lifesaving he said to Variety Can you imagine how many lives this is going to be saving  kids young queer folk who are being bullied committing suicide and not seeing themselves being represented And now they get to see this  its above and beyond

It is the festival that celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and this year Diwali held a special significance for India as it got back into full swing for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began

Oil lamps lit up windows shops homes and monuments across the country and devotees gathered at temples and shrines as excitement over the festival severely dampened last year by Covid19 gripped the country once more

In the holy city of Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh 900000 earthen lamps were lit on the banks of the Sarayu River as dusk fell on Wednesday Hindus believe the city is the birthplace of the god Ram In Amritsar the Sikh Golden temple was enveloped in fairy lights

In accordance with longstanding tradition to mark the festival the armies of India and Pakistan exchanged sweets at the Tithwal crossing bridge on the Line of Control that divides parts of Kashmir

The Hindu festival represents new beginnings but for many who lost their relatives and loved ones in the devastating second wave that swept through India last spring it was the first Diwali without family members

Shriya Chatterjee 42 whose mother died in April from the virus said the festival would not be the same without her She had all these traditions she would make us do every year and would boss us all around to make sure everything was perfect It would drive me crazy but now this year Im making sure we celebrate as she would have But Ive avoided parties and we are keeping it small to be cautious because we know that Covid hasnt gone away

Indias prime minister Narendra Modi had urged people to take precautions and to be wary of Covid Though in the capital celebrations were in full swing in the days leading up to the festival

For residents there the morning of Diwali also brought with it the annual spectre of pollution as air quality hit hazardous levels Levels of PM25  the smallest and most harmful particles polluting the air  peaked at an average of 389 on Thursday The figure is more than 15 times higher than the safe limits set by the World Health Organization

The California condor is the largest flying bird in North America it has a wingspan that enables it to soar up to 15000ft  nearly half the height of a commercial airplane

Now the birds can claim another remarkable feat scientists have discovered that females can reproduce without a male partner in a rare phenomenon known as parthenogenesis

Oliver Ryder the director of conservation genetics for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has called the recent findings a eureka moment

Condors have been imperilled for a century As Europeans settled the west they often shot poisoned and captured the condors collected their eggs and reduced their food supply of antelope elk and other large wild animals Their population declined steadily until only 22 remained in 1982 but a stateled recovery program has since successfully bred the animals back from the brink

The journey that led to discovering the condors asexual reproduction also began in the 1980s when the San Diego Zoo was tasked with developing a test to determine the sex of the few remaining wild condors Ryder remembers the conversation with his colleague about the strange cases He got goosebumps as he realized that the condors had reproduced through parthenogenesis  a form of reproduction in which an egg can develop into an embryo without being fertilized by a sperm 

Condors can live into their 50s but both of the male chicks born of asexual reproduction were relatively small and died before becoming sexually mature at 19 and 79 years old

Parthenogenesis is derived from the Greek words for virgin birth and several insect species including aphids bees and ants are known to reproduce through the process although the phenomenon is rare in birds

The condor is still considered a threatened species and it remains unclear what solo reproduction will mean in terms of helping with conservation efforts 

But Ryder says he is delighted that the bird is rewriting scientific understanding This is really wondrous and amazing  in the midst of an extinction crisis scientists are still making big discoveries

In some respects preventing climate breakdown is highly complicated But in another its really simple we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground writes George Monbiot in his latest Guardian opinion piece

He continues Everything about the relationship between nation states and the fossil fuel industry is perverse stupid and selfdestructive

For the sake of this dirty industrys profits and dividends  overwhelmingly concentrated among a tiny number of the worlds people  governments commit us to catastrophe

In an indepth interview actor Salma Hayek has spoken about her time working on the film Frida with convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein who produced the movie

Heres a snippet from the piece by our columnist Hadley Freeman

In 2017 Hayek wrote a blistering piece for the New York Times detailing how he sexually harassed her for years and how she kept saying no

No to me taking a shower with him No to letting him watch me take a shower No to letting him give me a massage No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage No to letting him give me oral sex No to my getting naked with another woman No no no no no  And with every refusal came Harveys Machiavellian rage

Hayek understandably isnt superexcited about rehashing this particular part of her history Its so boring and old she groans But when I tell her that Weinstein bullied me got me banned from restaurants and parties and even wrote an article about me because he didnt like things Id written she perks right up

Now I want to interview you Now this is an interesting conversation because if you really look at my piece youll see that I really focused on the bullying rather than the sexual harassment and I do think women got it worse from him Weinstein is not the only man to reassure himself by knowing he can destroy women she says

I ask if she normalised his bullying as a way to cope with it

To a degree And I did feel all right when he bullied me OK I would shake afterwards and it did depress me but there was a cartoon aspect about the whole thing When he would call me up during the making of Frida and scream Why do you have a monobrow and moustache I didnt hire you to look ugly I was like But didnt you ever look at a picture of Frida Kahlo If a man was playing Cyrano de Bergerac he wouldnt say Whats with the nose

By the way she says Weinstein was not the first or last one who treated her like that In Hollywood or in general

In general Were girls  So you learn to be brave Its not easy but you have to

The disruption from the climate emergency being experienced by marine wildlife has seemingly reached a new high

In the first week of the Cop26 summit a female walrus was discovered sleeping on a Dutch submarine in a naval base in North Holland

Freya as the animal has been named is the first of her species to visit the Netherlands in 23 years Walruses normally live in the polar regions  several hundred miles north

She was spotted snoozing on the submarine in the naval port of Den Helder by Jeroen Hoekendijk a Dutch scientist specialising in marine mammals

Freya is thought to have swum south from her Arctic comfort zone following the Danish and German coasts

While she appears to be in good health Hoekendijk  who observed the animal feeding on razor clams earlier  noted a raw wound in her front flippers

This particular animal is one of at least two of the species that have been seen far from their Arctic habitat Another wandering walrus seen off the Scilly Islands France Spain and West Cork in Ireland has since been sighted back in Icelandic waters

Social media users quipped that the Arctic mammal showed an excellent example of animalinitiated civil resistance and that considering military are huge contributors to carbon emissions the walrus is probably protesting climate justice

Right now in Glasgow there are hundreds of protesters taking part in a Greenwash march  as the Cop26 summit takes place around them

The activists are trying to draw attention to the climate criminals who are greenwashing rather than showing the real leadership needed to tackle climate breakdown according to the event page of the group Extinction Rebellion  who organised the action

The UN conference which is taking place until 12 November has already seen a score of promises and commitments by governments and world leaders to properly confront the climate crisis  and to set the world on a path to limit global heating to 15C

But even just this week Brazils president Jair Bolsonaro was accused by activist of greenwashing as he made big promises to stop the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest

Campaigners say they fear empty promises at Cop26 may gain countries access to conservation money but that the world should pay more attention to the destructive policies of the recent past than vague promises about the future

How bad are emissions from key polluting countries

As world leaders descend on Glasgow for vital United Nations Cop26 climate talks seen as one of the last chances to prevent environmental breakdown they will try their utmost to be seen to be taking action

But when it comes to the data where do the biggest polluters really stand

To help get a clearer picture our environment team has created data profiles for individual countries using the most recent available data from the UN the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD IEA Statistics and Climate Action Tracker CAT

The information is broken down into five key categories total greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emissions per capita modern renewables share in final energy consumption any current net zero target and CAT rating

At the top of the leaderboard for total emissions is China which is rated highly insufficient by CAT and has a net zero target of before 2060 And in second place is the US which in 2019 emitted 1977 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita of greenhouse gases

The UK cohost of Cop26 is rated almost sufficient by CAT but despite being home to the worlds largest offshore wind energy market in 2019 its renewable energy share was only 122  considerably lower than the overall EU figure of 182 and far behind other European countries including the other cohost Italy 173 Portugal 282 and Norway 624 Meanwhile big polluters Russia Iran and Saudi Arabia none of which have set net zero targets were among those classed as critically insufficient

The president of the Pacific island nation of Palau has told the Cop26 summit that parallels can be drawn between the climate crisis and the tradition Palau story of a boy who grew into a giant who wouldnt stop growing

Due to his unruly appetite the whole island community was forced to feed him  depleting all the natural resources said Surangel Whipps Jr to fellow world leaders in Glasgow

He explained how the islanders ultimately set the boy on fire after he turned on them and tried to eat them  and pointed out that the story was eerily reminiscent of todays climate emergency

Large emitters with insatiable appetites are continuing to abuse our environment threatening our very survival Cop26 must light the fire

He added that devastated island nations such as Palau demand that commitments of 100bn annually be increased to meet the 4tn the World Bank says is needed to tackle the climate crisis

We see the scorching sun is giving us intolerable heat the warming sea is invading us and the winds are blowing us every which way our resources are disappearing before our eyes and our future is being robbed from us he added

Frankly speaking there is no dignity to a slow and painful death  you might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer only to witness our slow and painful demise

Leaders of the G20 we are drowning and our only hope is the lifering you are holding You must act now we must act together

I think Ghoramara will disappear underwater within 10 or 15 years

Throughout the 2021 UN climate change conference Cop26 we will be publishing the stories of the people whose lives have been devastated by the climate breakdown

This is Sunil Kandars story

I live in the Hatkhola locality of Ghoramara in India I remember how on this island during my childhood I had a very happy and enjoyable life We had a big mudwalled house We also had large farmland of our own where rice and other vegetables grew We sold a big part of our farm produce in the market Like some other families in the island we were pretty rich The farmland owned by our family was our biggest strength

Our island is located at the mouth of a river coming from the north The northern edge of the island began sinking bit by bit under the river water when I was a child Then 20 or 25 years ago the sea began eating away land around the southern edge of the island where we lived Ghoramara began going underwater almost from all sides and the island began shrinking fast Farmlands and houses of the people are constantly going underwater

Cyclones are pounding our island more frequently in recent years The fragile island is too feeble to keep away the tidal waves Whatever farmlands are left on the island are turning unusable because of inundation by seawater and increasing salinity of the soil

Once I owned four acres of farmland In the past 20 years threequarters of it has been lost under the sea This year I have been forced to buy rice for us for the first time in my life

I am over 50 now I cannot go out of the island learn a new skill and pick up another job My son knew he cannot earn a living on this island So he left the island and has become a migrant daywage labourer in south India and sends money to support our family

Oceanographers and other experts came to the island and conducted studies five years ago They said the water level around the island is rising and it will perhaps completely vanish underwater by 2050 But in the past five years the island has been shrinking I think Ghoramara will disappear underwater within 10 or 15 years
The global death toll from Covid19 is now about equal to the entire populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined according to figures released from the Johns Hopkins University

19 months after the pandemic was first declared it has been confirmed that at least five million people have died from the virus  though some experts including those from the World Health Organization believe the true toll may be two to three times higher than official figures suggest

The US Brazil India Mexico and the UK disproportionately account for more than half of all deaths worldwide

The number of deaths from Covid19 far outstrip that of other viral epidemics in the 21st century and most from the 20th century with the notable exception of the Spanish flu  where the number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide

The death toll as tallied by Johns Hopkins rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950 according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo Globally Covid19 is the third leading cause of death after heart disease and stroke

Since it was first recorded in China in late 2019 the coronavirus spread quickly to almost every corner of the world and was declared a pandemic in March 2020 The virus has since mutated into more than a dozen new variants including the highly infectious Delta strain

In the last month the US UK Russia Turkey and Ukraine have recorded the most new cases while 581m doses of vaccine have been administered worldwide The US has the largest death toll at 745836 followed by India 458437

The majority of those dying of Covid19 particularly in the UK and the US are have not been vaccinated

This island is me and I am this island Wadhuam Pabai Pabai pictured on the left says of the homeland hes known all his life

I cant imagine being forced to leave Boigu  there are 65000 years of wealth and experience here the father of seven says Losing Boigu his home in the Torres Strait will mean losing all of it

He and fellow islander Wadhuam Paul Kabai pictured on the right are leading a class action on behalf of their island communities arguing the commonwealth of Australia is acting unlawfully in failing to stop climate change that if unchecked will destroy their homelands

They are drawing inspiration  if not direct precedent  from a case from the Netherlands know as the Urgenda case This is where 886 plaintiffs argued the Dutch government had an obligation to protect its citizens from the impacts of climate change That case challenged all the way to the countrys supreme court by the government succeeded at every level

The result was a dramatic shift in Dutch government policy  including the closure of coalfired power stations billions of euros of investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency and binding commitments towards emissions reductions Similar cases have followed in Belgium Canada Colombia Germany France New Zealand and elsewhere

But the Urgenda decision relied significantly on the European Convention on Human Rights  particularly articles two and eight safeguarding the rights to life and to a private and family life That law does not apply to Australia but lawyers will argue the commonwealth of Australia has a legal duty of care towards Torres Strait Islander peoples arising both from negligence law and the Torres Strait Treaty and Native Title

Lego is touting it as its most ambitious build to date but rather than many pages of instructions the toymakers handbook offers only 10 steps 

The booklet is not for a physical model though Instead the new mock up of a Lego instruction manual offers building instructions for a better world It was put together based on research and workshops conducted with more than 6000 young people from around the world

Nearly half of the children told researchers they thought about the environment once a week while one in 10 thought about it every day Global heating was their No 1 concern

The handbooks will be handed out to delegates at the crucial Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow this week  with Tim Brooks the vicepresident of environmental responsibility at Lego saying the initiative sought to give children a voice at the climate talks

Brooks added that feedback from youngsters had spurred Legos action on singleuse plastic which will be removed from its sets by 2025 as well as work on recycled bricks The company which produces billions of plastic bricks a year had shown leadership on the environment he said but acknowledged there is always more to do

For too long many of us were fed a false narrative that we should feel individually guilty about the climate crisis

Politicians across all party lines also joined the conversation about the controversial rebrand New York progressive congresswoman Alexandria OcasioCortez didnt hold back in her disapproval calling the company a cancer to democracy and a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society

US Senator Richard Blumenthal alleged the name change was nothing more than an effort to confuse and distract but ultimately wont erase years of devious practices  disregard for privacy kids wellbeing spreading hate  genocide

Twitter also jumped on board with the official Twitter account joking they had big news followed by the clarification  lol jk still twitter

Zuckerberg revealed the new name at Facebooks annual ARVR conference on Thursday where he outlined the companys virtualreality vision for the future He said Meta would encompass Facebook as well as apps such as Instagram WhatsApp and the virtual reality brand Oculus

The US has issued its first passport with an X gender designation  a milestone in the recognition of the rights of people who dont identify as male or female  with the state department saying it expects to be able to offer the option more broadly in 2022

Jessica Stern the US special diplomatic envoy for LGBTQ rights called the moves historic and celebratory adding that they brought the government documents in line with the lived reality that there is a wider spectrum of human sex characteristics than is reflected in the previous two designations

Dana Zzyym an intersex Colorado resident who has been in a legal battle with the department since 2015 said their passport is the first US passport to be issued with an X gender designation

Zzyym pronounced Zimm was denied a passport for failing to check male or female on an application According to court documents Zzyym wrote intersex above the boxes marked M and F and requested an X gender marker instead

Zzyym served in the navy as a male but later came to identify as intersex while working and studying at Colorado State University

The departments initial denial prevented Zzyym from traveling to a meeting of Organization Intersex International in Mexico

The state department announced in June that it was moving toward adding a third gender marker for nonbinary intersex and gendernonconforming people but said it would take time

A department official said the full passport application and system update with the X designation option still need to be approved by the Office of Management and Budget

The department now also allows applicants to selfselect their gender no longer requiring medical certification if their gender did not match that listed on their other identification documents

The United States joins a handful of countries including Australia New Zealand Nepal and Canada in allowing its citizens to designate a gender other than male or female on their passports

Going for a night out with friends is meant to be among our most carefree and happy times but for many young women that experience is now rife with anxiety

The phenomenon of spiking  where a stranger drugs your drink leaving you incapacitated and unable to remember what happened to you  has been known for many years frequently as a grim prelude to sexual assault

But a recent spate of reports in university towns in the UK has left a new generation of students worried for their safety and angry that more is not done to ensure they are protected

Sarah Buckle is a student at the University of Nottingham and believes she was spiked by injection while out clubbing with friends during Freshers week

Medics told her that she showed signs of having been spiked It was then that she noticed a small pinprick on her hand which was bruised and throbbing

Heres her story

One of the worst pages in the history of the Italian republic

Thats how Pina Picierno a Democratic party member of the European parliament described Italys senate decision to vote down an antihomophobic violence bill

The senate has killed off a bill that would have made violence against LGBT people and disabled people as well as misogyny a hate crime

The 315member senate voted by 154 to 131 on Wednesday to block the debate on the law named after the gay centreleft Democratic party PD legislator Alessandro Zan It was previously approved by the lower house of parliament in the face of months of protests from farright and Catholic groups

According to the farright parties that voted against the bill in the upper house the law would have suppressed freedom of expression and promoted homosexual propaganda in schools

Last June the Vatican made an unprecedented intervention urging the Italian government to change the law over concerns it would infringe upon the Catholic churchs freedom of thought

Debate over the approval of the bill which would lead to people convicted of such crimes being jailed for up to four years and permit an increase in funding for groups that work to fight against discrimination and assist people who are the victims of it came after a series of highprofile attacks against gay and transgender people

Rights groups receive hundreds of hate crime reports each year but many go unpunished Although Italy approved samesex civil unions in 2016 the country has lagged behind its EU partners in creating antihomophobia measures

Attempts by various governments over the past three decades to enact a similar law have either been stifled or sabotaged with any progress or even just meaningful debate stymied by a macho culture Catholicism and support for farright parties

Theyre not these mindless killers but we just happen to look like their food

New research by Australian scientists has supported the theory that great white sharks do not actively seek out humans as prey

The study says that on the rare occasion the apex predator attacks a human the bite may be the result of mistaken identity because they may not be able to visually distinguish surfers and swimmers at the waters surface from their natural prey

The team macquarieuni compared video footage of swimmers people paddling surfboards and seals from the perspective of a great white shark viewing from below in the water

Taking into account what a shark is likely to see when looking up at a person or seal against the background skylight the researchers concluded that neither the silhouette shape nor motion cues were enough for a shark to clearly tell them apart

Great whites are thought to be more successful in hunting prey at the waters surface Sharks are also thought to be colour blind or to have only limited ability to perceive colours at best

Their acuity or their ability to see detail is much lower than ours the studys lead author Dr Laura Ryan said Theyre not these mindless killers but we just happen to look like their food

Ryan said more research was needed into other species involved in shark bites such as bull shark and tiger sharks Were not sure if mistaken identity applies to them Seals arent a common prey item for them but they do consume things like turtles  and things floating at the surface

What or who do you think is to blame for the climate crisis

A majority of Americans want to see oil and gas companies held to account for lying about the climate crisis and contributing to global heating according to a new YouGov poll commissioned by the guardianus vicenews and coveringclimate

The survey reveals that the US remains sharply divided over the causes of the deepening environmental emergency following the fossil fuel industrys long campaign to downplay and deny climate science

The poll surveyed 1000 American adults and found that 70 said global warming was happening More than 60 said oil and gas companies were completely or mostly responsible

But Democrats and Republicans at odds over the source of climate disinformation While Democrats overwhelmingly 89 accept the scientific basis of the climate emergency opinion is split among Republicans Just 42 of Republicans agreed that global warming is a reality while 36 denied it The remainder said they didnt know

Political division also emerges again when people were asked about the specifics of the fossil fuel industrys misdeeds

Democrats said oil and gas companies lied about the existence of climate change and their part in creating it at more than three times the rate of Republicans Just under half of Republicans said oil and gas companies had done nothing wrong

But one of the clearest divisions remains over scientific opinion on the climate crisis

While 68 of Democrats said that most scientists think global warming is humancaused just 22 of Republicans agreed Half of Republicans said there is a lot of disagreement on the issue among scientists a position held by less than 15 of Democrats

The offspring of hippos once owned by Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar can be recognized as people or interested persons with legal rights in the US following a federal court order

The case involves a lawsuit against the Colombian government over whether to kill or sterilize the hippos whose numbers are growing at a fast pace and pose a threat to biodiversity

The socalled cocaine hippos  pictured above  are descendants of animals that Escobar illegally imported to his Colombian ranch in the 1980s when he reigned over the countrys drug trade

After his death in a 1993 shootout with authorities the hippos were abandoned at the estate and left to thrive with no natural predators Their numbers have increased in the last eight years from 35 to somewhere between 65 and 80

A group of scientists has warned that the hippos pose a threat to the areas biodiversity and could lead to deadly encounters with humans They are advocating for some of the animals to be killed A government agency has started sterilizing some of the hippos but there is a debate on what are the safest methods

An animal rights groups is hailing the order as a milestone victory in the longstanding efforts to sway the US justice system to grant animals personhood status

But the order granted by federal magistrate judge Karen Litkovitz in Cincinnati will not carry any weight in Colombia where the hippos live a legal expert said

Christopher Berry the lead attorney for the Animal Legal Defense Fund called it a narrow but profound ruling

This really is part of a bigger movement of advocating that animals interest be represented in court he said Were not asking to make up a new law Were just asking that animals have the ability to enforce the rights that have already been given to them

Despite facing racism throughout his career Wilston Samuel Jackson dedicated his life to railway He has now been honoured at a ceremony in London

The picture above shows his greatgrandchildren Josiah Lawrence and Sofia beneath the new blue plaque commemorating him as Britains first black train driver

Speaking at the event yesterday his daughter Polly Jackson said He was never late or missed a day and he was so proud of his work despite the many challenges he faced Today was a fitting tribute to his life and career

Born in Jamaica Jackson  who died in 2018 at the age of 91  began maintaining trains shortly after moving to London in 1952 as part of the Windrush generation

He went on to become a driver a decade later and had a long and successful career on the railway including driving the famous Flying Scotsman locomotive and The Elizabethan

Known as Bill Jackson worked his way from a maintenance role to a position managing train boilers which saw him spend the day shovelling coal in hot and filthy conditions He would then return home to study for his driver exams

His journey to becoming a train driver came at a time when many black people had their applications blocked due to racism and Jacksons appointment in 1962 sparked a furious reaction from some of his white colleagues who unsuccessfully attempted to prevent white men from working under him

Two years later Jackson broke both his legs when his train crashed into the back of a stationary goods train near Finsbury Park after a signalman mistakenly gave a green light After his recovery he returned to the railway before later emigrating to Zambia where he taught people how to drive trains

Mick Whelan general secretary of the train drivers union Aslef said We are incredibly proud to have had Wilston as one of our own a dedicated driver with an illustrious and groundbreaking career

Recent figures from Aslef revealed that only 10 of Britains train drivers are from black Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds

Japans Princess Mako has lost her royal status after marrying her commoner college sweetheart Kei Komuro  a man she described as irreplaceable

After years of criticism of their relationship that has left Mako who is Emperor Naruhitos niece struggling with her mental health the couple announced at a press conference at a hotel in Tokyo yesterday that they had wed 

Mako and Komuro who met at university almost a decade ago were originally due to marry in 2018 but postponed after Japanese media revealed that Komuros mother was embroiled in a minor financial scandal

The couple who did not have a formal wedding ceremony or hold a reception banquet or any of the traditional rites associated with imperial weddings said they paid for yesterdays press conference venue themselves amid accusations on social media that they should not waste taxpayers money

Her father Crown Prince Akishino had reportedly opposed a traditional royal wedding after acknowledging that the Japanese public were divided over their marriage in light of reports that Komuros mother had failed to repay a loan of 4m 25387 although there have been claims that the money was a gift

The couple have inevitably invited comparisons with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle owing to the media onslaught and their decision to move to the US

Japans maleonly succession laws mean Mako who gained a masters degree from Leicester University can never be a reigning empress If she has a son he will be raised as a nonroyal and will not ascend the Chrysanthemum throne

Her departure from the palace has highlighted the dearth of heirs to the throne while pressure to reform the succession laws has failed to gain traction under successive conservative governments 

Makos father is first in line followed by her younger brother Prince Hisahito If Hisahito does not have a male child the line of succession will be broken

Retreat is not an option

Sudans military has launched a coup arresting leading politicians and declaring a state of emergency as thousands of protesters who flooded the streets of Khartoum in opposition reportedly faced gunfire

Gen Abdel Fattah alBurhan who headed Sudans powersharing sovereign council justified the seizure of power by saying infighting between the military and civilian parties threatened the countrys stability

Footage shared online appeared to show protesters blocking streets and setting fire to tires in the capital and its twin city of Omdurman as security forces used teargas to disperse them

Protesters could be heard chanting The people are stronger stronger and Retreat is not an option as plumes of smoke filled the air The internet has been cut and key bridges closed

Sudan has been on edge since a failed coup plot last month unleashed recriminations between military and civilian groups who have been sharing power following the toppling of the autocrat Omar alBashir two years ago

Members of a disparate alliance including warlords military militia leaders and former Bashir regime loyalists have been calling for the restoration of military rule while several cabinet ministers took part last week in big protests in Khartoum and other cities against the prospect

The prime minister Abdalla Hamdok was detained overnight and moved to an undisclosed location after refusing to issue a statement in support of the coup said the information ministry which was still apparently under the control of Hamdoks supporters

Images posted on social media appeared to show large crowds marching on Khartoums Africa Street which runs from near the international airport towards the city centre with the sound of gunfire audible in some videos Initial reports suggest at least a dozen people had been injured

The US which has been mediating in Sudan condemned the arrests and threatened to withhold assistance and domestic opponents of the military opposition called for nationwide protests and a general strike

Tommie Smith still gets chills when he hears the opening bars of The Star Spangled Banner

It takes him right back to that night in October 1968 when he stood on the Olympic podium in Mexico City wearing his gold medal and made the raisedfist salute that has defined his life

Because thats the first three notes I heard in Mexico then my head went down and I saw no more of it until the last note While the anthem played all that was going through Smiths head he says was prayer and pain

Pain because he had picked up a thigh injury that day on the way to winning the 200m final he still set a world record

And prayer because Smith was not just putting his career on the line  he was risking his life

There was a real possibility that somebody in the stadium might try to shoot him or his teammate John Carlos who was making the salute beside him after winning bronze

The goal was human rights Smith stresses not Black power

Would you live in an ecotown

If you are wondering what a climateconscious future looks like the small town of Skellefte in the far north of Sweden has some of the answers

The wooden wonder might seem like a novelty oneoff

But the architects are keen to emphasise that the same process could be replicated anywhere many hundreds of miles from a forest

We are currently studying how far we could transport this building without undoing the carbon saving says White Arkitekters Robert Schmitz

We think it could probably go twice around the world and still be carbon neutral

When so many of us think of classic literature  plenty of white authors probably spring to mind Shakespeare Dickens Austen Hardy Fitzgerald Harper Lee who wrote about race is a favourite of many  but Black authors themselves are vastly underrepresented

Students in the UK might get the chance to study Toni Morrison or James Baldwin but what about the rest of Black literatures vast history

Reports last year revealed that it was possible for pupils to complete their GCSEs and leave school without having studied a single novel or play by a nonwhite author Now leading contemporary writers are trying to do something to address this problem

Halyna Hutchins was a talented and passionate cinematographer who was clearly enjoying her job as director of photography on Alec Baldwins latest cowboy movie Rust 

The 42yearold died on the set of the film yesterday after Baldwin  an actor and producer of the film  fired a prop gun in an accident that also injured its director authorities have said

Over the past three weeks Hutchins posted photos on her Instagram account from the films rugged set in the foothills of New Mexico They included vivid sunsets and a cast and crew picture in which Hutchins is standing next to Baldwin against the backdrop a log cabin

There is also a short video clip taken on Wednesday in which Hutchins  wearing a grey scarf and widebrimmed hat  sets off on horseback with colleagues One of the perks of shooting a western is you get to ride horses on your day off she wrote

Born in Ukraine in 1979 when the country was part of the Soviet Union Hutchins journey from the USSR to Hollywood was an improbable one She grew up on a military base in the Arctic Circle surrounded by reindeer and nuclear submarines An army brat she said she got interested in film because there wasnt that much to do outside

Hutchins started her career as a reporter after studying international journalism at Kyiv National University She worked on several British film productions in eastern Europe travelling to remote locations and saw how the cinematographer worked

I was fascinated with storytelling based on real characters she said A selfconfessed adrenaline junkie Hutchins documented her forays into extreme sports including parachuting and cave exploration A decade or so ago she decided to concentrate on filmmaking fulltime and moved to California

According to American Cinematographer Hutchins took whatever production jobs she could find She also dabbled in fashion photography to learn more about what she called the aesthetics of lighting  how you create the mood the feeling

Can our bodies withstand global heating

Between 1998 and 2017 more than 166000 people died due to heat according to the World Health Organization and countries around the world are experiencing a year on year rise in recordbreaking high temperatures

For many people unendurable heat is becoming the new normal It is most likely to disproportionately affect the poor the sick  those with chronic conditions or heart and kidney disease in particular  and older people

Each organ responds differently to extreme heat exposure with symptoms that quickly become fatal or cause lingering damage from which the body may never fully recover

We spoke to Mike McGeehin environmental health epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr Pieter Vancamp postdoctoral researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris Dr Richard Johnson professor of medicine and head of renal diseases and hypertension at the University of Colorado and Dr Edward Walter a consultant and anaesthetist at the Royal Surrey county hospital about the impact of extreme heat on our bodies

The number of sculptures that feature animals in London is twice that of named women a new study has found

The findings show that out of almost 1500 monuments in the capital more than a fifth are dedicated to named men 205 and only 4 are dedicated to named women

The number of sculptures that feature animals almost 100 is double that of named women Just 1 of sculptures are dedicated to named people of colour 09 are men of colour and 02 are named women of colour

The study part of a national research project by Art UK funded in part by City Hall is the first comprehensive audit of public sculpture and monuments across the capital

It comes as the mayor of London Sadiq Khan announces details of a 1m fund to ensure the capitals landmarks and monuments better reflect the diversity and the achievements of all who have contributed to the success of the city

A sunfish estimated to weigh up to 2000kg 4410lb has been found tangled in tuna fishing nets in the Mediterranean

The gigantic animal was measured at 32 metres long and 29 metres wide a record find for Ceuta a Spanish autonomous city on the north coast of Africa It was so heavy a big a crane was needed to winch it aboard a ship during rescue efforts  and it almost broke a 1000kg scale 

The fishs extraction from and return to the water went smoothly to the relief of both fishermen and scientists  including marine biologist Enrique Ostal who says he had heard of sunfish this size only in books

Latvia has announced a monthlong coronavirus lockdown after an unprecedented surge in infections

The Baltic country becomes the first country in Europe to reimpose farreaching restrictions as countries across the continent suffer a new wave of cases

Latvia was for a long time viewed as one of Europes lone coronavirus success stories recording fewer than 3000 Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic

Now it has one of the highest rates of new Covid cases per capita in the world according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Critics say a sluggish and uneven vaccination rate has led to the rise in infections

Romania and Ukraine have also recorded a surge of new infections and Covid deaths as the countries struggle to convince their populations to get vaccinated

And with colder weather and few restrictions the virus also looks to be regaining strength in heavily vaccinated countries such as the UK and the Netherlands

Could this be the significant step in the long quest to one day use animal organs for lifesaving transplants

In a major scientific advance surgeons at a New York hospital have attached a pigs kidney to a human and watched it begin to work  it filtered waste and produced urine  and for the first time ever did not trigger a rejection

The researchers kept a deceased womans body going on a ventilator after her family agreed to the experiment feeling that there was a possibility that some good could come from this gift

Pigs have been the most recent research focus to address the organ shortage but a sugar in their cells which is foreign to the human body causes immediate organ rejection

The kidney for this experiment came from a geneedited animal engineered to eliminate that sugar and avoid an immune system attack

Several biotech companies are in the running to develop suitable pig organs for transplant to help ease the human organ shortage

More than 90000 people in the US are in line for a kidney transplant Every day 12 people die while waiting

But for many people raising pigs to be organ donors feels morally wrong though it may grow more acceptable if concerns about animal welfare can be addressed says Karen Maschke a research scholar at the Hastings Center The other issue is going to be Should we be doing this just because we can Maschke said

A terrorist bombing has targeted a passing army bus in the Syrian capital killing at least 14 people the Sana state news agency has reported

The attack is the deadliest in Damascus since a bombing targeted the Justice Palace in March 2017 killing at least 30 people The city had been largely spared such violence in recent years especially since troops and allied militia retook the last significant rebel bastion near the city in 2018

No group has yet claimed responsibility for todays attack but moments later shelling by government forces struck the warravaged town of Ariha in Idlib a region controlled by groups that have claimed to have carried out such bombings in the past

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rockets struck a busy area at the time children were heading to school Three children were among those killed the Britainbased war monitoring group said

The Damascus bombing will challenge the Syrian regimes assertion that the decadeold war is over and stability guaranteed for reconstruction efforts and investment projects to begin in earnest

A 35mtall puppet child refugee has nearly completed her 8000km journey across Europe to highlight the hostility experienced by refugees who have been travelling the same route from the Syrian border to the UK for years

The unaccompanied nineyearold Syrian girl searching for her mother  the character of Amal which means hope in Arabic  was developed from a play created by the refugee theatre company Good Chance

The goal of her epic trek was to make thousands of people along the route to reflect on their attitudes towards refugees particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced children forced to flee their homes because of conflict over the past decade

Little Amal started The Walk in the Turkish city of Gaziantep in July and will end in Manchester England in early November Today she was greeted by a group of schoolchildren alongside British actor Jude Law on Folkestone Pier after crossing the Channel

Things havent always gone smoothly along the way In Greece farright protesters threw things at her as she walked through the streets and local councillors voted to ban her from visiting a village of Orthodox monasteries In France the mayor of Calais raised objections to her presence

But there have been bright spots on her journey too As she started the walk in Gaziantep at the Turkish border with Syria refugee children made lanterns to welcome her In Italy the puppet went to the Vatican and shook hands with the Pope while thousands of children in Brussels wrote letters to her in an effort to make them to think about the experience of being a child refugee

As she crossed the Channel to the UK on Tuesday for the final stage of her journey producer David Lan said If I was to say to you we had nothing but warmth and support along the 8000km journey it would not be true

But what Little Amal seems to do is take the experience of people who are quite brutally marginalised and put it in the centre This is about goodwill It is an opportunity for people to be sympathetic and imagine what it would be like to be her

From orangutans swinging through psychedelic forests to deer roaming saturated canyons  artist Jim Naughten hopes to draw attention to natures rapid disappearance and our growing estrangement with it

For his latest exhibition he has combined photography and painting to create images of the natural world as a faraway fictional fantasy

Naughten drew inspiration from dioramas of animal forms found in natural history museums all over the world before digitally reimagining them in defamiliarised and unrealistic contexts

His digital painting technique is closely linked to magic realism in which the boundary between fact and fiction imagination and reality becomes blurred through the intersection of mediums

Im interested in how in the evolutionary blink of an eye humans have come to dominate and overwhelm the planet and how far our relationship with the natural world has fundamentally and dangerously shifted from that of our ancestors

I hope the work will create awareness and discourse about this disconnection our fictionalised ideas about nature and possibilities for positive change

As an increasing number of countries businesses and individuals mark World Menopause Day today UK lawmaker Carolyn Harris says she is ready to shame whoever stands in the way of progress

The Labour MP is pushing a private members bill on menopause which is due to be heard later this month to demand free prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy in England  which is already available in Scotland and Wales Harris says she has crossparty support from dozens of MPs

Menopause campaigners argue that medical sexism and a lack of training means many women are left to suffer the symptoms of menopause  which can include depression anxiety insomnia and brain fog as well as hot flushes

In the UK there are more than 13 million currently experiencing menopause or perimenopause meaning around menopause  and it is estimated the nation could be losing 14m work days a year related to the menopause The recent research also concluded that one in four women who experience menopausal symptoms  many at the top of their career  consider leaving their job

Many more businesses are joining the menopause revolution though says Harris  pointing to companies such as Cult Beauty which has introduced comprehensive policies around miscarriage IVF pregnancy and the menopause But its not enough to have a policy she adds This cant be a boxticking exercise companies and the government really have to genuinely want to help these workers

Harriss own experience with the menopause was brutal Twenty years after losing her eightyearold son in a road traffic accident she blamed herself for not processing her grief when she was hit by a deep depression It took me six years having conversations with women for me to realise I was going through the menopause she says

Now she wants to use her voice in parliament to speak up for those who she says are often just too tired to fight Theres a hell of a lot of women my age working and they are exhausted she says A lot of those women are going through the menopause but they are not being treated because there is still not enough understanding about a condition that affects 51 of the population
Colin Powell the first Black US secretary of state has died at the age of 84 from complications from Covid19

In a statement on Facebook his family said We have lost a remarkable and loving husband father grandfather and a great American They also said that Powell was fully vaccinated and thanked the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their caring treatment

Powell who was wounded in Vietnam rose to occupy the top military position in the US government as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff between 1989 and 1993 but it was in the build up to the contentious invasion of Iraq that Powell became a household name

He was the face of the Bush administrations aggressive attempt to get the world community to back the invasion based on false claims of Iraqs possession of weapons of mass destruction 

Powell stepped down as secretary of state in November 2004 following Bushs reelection He later insisted to reporters that he had tried to warn Bush of the consequences of invading Iraq but had supported the president when the decision to proceed was taken

In a statement on Monday Bush called Powell a great public servant He was such a favorite of Presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom  twice He was highly respected at home and abroad

Powell considered a bid to become the first Black president in 1996 but his wife Almas worries about his safety helped him decide otherwise

And after his time in government Powell remained a hugely influential commentator on US politics and public life Over the years he grew increasingly distanced from his own Republican party disillusioned by its rightward drift 

In 2008 despite party rivalries he endorsed Barack Obama for president When Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House Powell became one of his leading critics

This charcoal and pencil drawing of Isaac Kyoyeta an events manager in Kampala is the work of Martin Senkubuge  a Ugandan artist who is challenging the stigma surrounding the skin condition vitiligo

Through his portraits Senkubuge aims to make people with the condition proud of their skin rather than cursed which he says is the way many people in the region are made to feel

People said that persons with vitiligo were cursed and bewitched says Senkubuge There was a lot of myths and misinformation surrounding them which was unfair

The 22yearold started reaching out to contacts who knew people who had the skin condition via social media proposing to draw their pictures It wasnt easy

I got about 60 contacts but only three showed up for the photoshoot he recalls But he would not give up He encouraged those three models to try to persuade others to participate in his campaign

I told them my intentions says Senkubuge I wanted them to pose stand tall and be proud of who they are I told them that art is beautiful and that healing begins from within

An estimated 1 of the global population have vitiligo which isnt contagious and can be hereditary caused by an autoimmune disease or trigged by a stressful event severe skin damage or exposure to certain chemicals But it gets little attention largely because it is regarded as a cosmetic condition rather than lifethreatening

People with vitiligo are already beautiful Senkubuge says We just want them to believe it He now plans to take his pictures and the campaign across east Africa

Jacky Wright the Londonborn corporate vicepresident and chief digital officer at Microsoft US was given this years top spot on 14 October by the Powerlist 2022 the annual list of the UKs most powerful people of African AfricanCaribbean and African American heritage

Marcus Rashford the footballer and campaigner came in second place while Anne Mensah vicepresident of Content UK at Netflix was third The Oscarwinning actor Daniel Kaluuya is a new entrant to the list in fourth

Steven Bartlett 29 founder and former CEO of Social Chain and the newly named youngest ever panellist on the BBC show Dragons Den is another new entrant

Wright welcomed the accolade but said the UK had a long way to go before it could call itself an equal society I am proud to be in the company of these great leaders of African and AfricanCaribbean heritage but I am reminded that we still have a very long way to go she said

Each of us has a responsibility to ensure that we not only showcase role models so future generations can envision who and what they can be but more importantly we need to make monumental shifts to create a more equitable society

Wright was selected by a panel of judges led by the retired high court judge Dame Linda Dobbs who said Wright took the top spot for the sheer scale of the work she is doing

As one of the most senior black leaders in the civil service and HMRCs disability champion Wright campaigned for diversity in government including race and disability

Were running out of time the clock is ticking said Anna Staneva the interim head of conservation at BirdLife Europe and Central Asia after Europes latest red list report revealed that one in five bird species on the continent are now at risk of extinction

Birds that have been the cornerstones of our ecosystems  including
the common swift common snipe and rook  are among species disappearing while the Pallass sandgrouse common buttonquail and pine bunting pictured above have all become regionally extinct

A species is regionally extinct if it has not been observed in Europe over a minimum period of five years

The BirdLife International analysis which is based on observations of 544 native bird species report that 30 of species assessed are showing population decline according to observations from thousands of experts and volunteers working in 54 countries and territories

However it is not all bad news The recovery of the bittern Azores bullfinch and griffon vulture show targeted action on species recovery can work Certain raptors such as red kites are doing better thanks to the banning of pesticides such as DDT and legal protection against persecution

The latest list will help inform ontheground conservation action and national and international environment policies

Recommendations from the report include creating a larger and better managed network of protected areas consistent with the UN target of protecting 30 of land by 2030 with substantial areas under strict protection such as no take marine protected areas and no logging forests

Is this a future were willing to accept

The land on which 10 of the worlds population lives could be lost to rising sea levels according to new projections by climatecentral

The nonprofit group has produced a collection of images which visualize what future sea level rise could look like if collectively we fail to meet carbon emissions reduction targets

Fifty major cities mostly in Asia and at least one large nation on every continent but Australia and Antarctica are at risk Many small island nations are threatened with near total loss of their land  taking with them the heritage and history of these coastal communities

Meeting the most ambitious goals of the Paris climate agreement could reduce the sea level rise exposure by roughly half But the world is not on course to limiting global warming to 15C 27F as outlined in the 2015 Paris agreement

Based on current emissions the Earth is expected to reach and even exceed 3C 54F warming by 2100

A picture is worth 1000 words or 1000 years in this case says Benjamin Strauss the CEO and chief scientist at Climate Central

Next month representatives from every country in the world will meet in Glasgow for the Cop26 climate conference where parties will be expected to commit to goals in response to the ongoing climate emergency

The decisions that we make at Glasgow and the actions that we take this decade will ramify for hundreds and thousands of years Strauss said This group is going to be remembered for what they chose did you choose a thriving future with a liveable climate or did you choose to drown the coastal places of the world

It has taken her 12 years 450 hours and at least 15m strokes but the Chlo McCardel has become the queen of the Channel by swimming the stretch of water between England and France for the 44th time

Im so thankful said the 36yearold Australian after breaking the record So many people helped along the way to make my dreams come true and hopefully I can inspire the next generation of open water swimmers and young people to go after their dreams

Last year she surpassed the mens world record of 34 crossings and this week she passed the record of 43 crossings held by British swimmer Alison Streeter Its been a hell of a journey She has suffered from hypothermia and battled boredom pain and jellyfish Whatever the experience the stretch of water kept calling her back The first time I really felt like Id found where I belonged she says Like my whole life has been heading to this one point But I have a lovehate relationship with the Channel On the bad days its like the French shoreline or the wind is tormenting me But Im drawn to it It has this incredible almost magical pull I call it my spiritual home

McCardel hopes her feats of endurance skill and grit will inspire other women She speaks openly about being a survivor of domestic violence and credits swimming with helping her begin to recover from PTSD After going through so much trauma swimming the Channel helped rebuild my confidence which was shaken a lot My sense of identity and my sense of self worth was shaken

Crossing the Channel a record number of times occasionally seemed crazy even to her Theres no logic behind it It is basically like how much punishment can your mind and body take before everything breaks

The rules are strict she cannot wear a wetsuit or anything that could provide protection  even a thermal swimming cap McCardel only learned to swim when she was 11 but soon started swimming competitively At 19 she decided she wanted to be the best in the world at something and took up marathon swimming Its been a really tough journey she says But Ive persisted

Prince Williams comments in an interview with Newscast on BBC Sounds were aired the day after actor William Shatner made history by becoming the oldest person in space The 90yearold known for his role in Star Trek lifted off from the Texas desert on Wednesday in a rocket built by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezoss space travel company Blue Origin

The duke who was interviewed about the climate crisis ahead of his inaugural Earthshot prize awards and global Cop26 summit also expressed his concerns about a rise in climate anxiety in young people He said it would be an absolute disaster if his eldest son Prince George was having to talk about the same issue in 30 years when it would be too late  and warned world leaders against clever words but not enough action

William added that his viewpoint had changed since he had kids I want the things that Ive enjoyed  the outdoor life nature the environment  I want that to be there for my children and not just my children but everyone elses children

England faces more floods and droughts rising sea levels and greater demand on water supplies due to the climate crisis the Environment Agency has warned

Ahead of the UN Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow the government agency is warning that adaptation  becoming resilient to the already inevitable effects of climate change  is just as important as actions to cut greenhouse gases

It is a case of adapt or die said the Environment Agencys chair Emma Howard Boyd warning that deadly events such as the flooding in Germany this summer would hit the UK if the country did not make itself resilient to the more violent weather the climate emergency was bringing

In a report to the government the EA said global heating would exacerbate the pressure on Englands water environment which is suffering from problems such as pollution and increased demand and make it harder to ensure clean and plentiful water

There will be more and worse environmental incidents such as flooding water shortages and pollution regulation is not ready for climate change and the natural world cannot adapt as fast as the climate is changing the EA said

The report notes that population growth and climate change will increase water demands and mean that if no further action is taken between 2025 and 2050 more than 34bn extra litres of water a day will be needed for resilient public water supplies

The Environment Agency said it was working with government businesses and communities on flood protection and with watchdog Ofwat on water supplies It said it was focusing on restoring and creating peatlands wetlands and other habitats to create resilient places for wildlife reduce the risk of flooding improve water quality and boost access to green spaces for people

Everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes

DC Comics has confirmed that the new iteration of Superman Jonathan Kent is bisexual

In the new comic the traditionally heterosexual superhero will embark on a samesex relationship with a friend Jay Nakamura a reporter who cares for him after he mentally and physically burns out from trying to save everyone that he can

Kent who is the son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane started his tenure in July

The idea of replacing Clark Kent with another straight white savior felt like a missed opportunity Tom Taylor the series writer said in an interview with the New York Times

Ive always said everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes and Im very grateful DC and Warner Bros share this idea

The news follows other recent attempts to add queerness to the world of comics In August it was announced that the latest version of Robin would have a boyfriend  while in March Marvel also made the decision to pass the mantle of Captain America to a gay character

Kents sexuality is not the only way in which Superman has been updated for a new audience and time

We cant even begin to imagine how uncomfortable this was 

Wildlife officials in Colorado say an elusive elk that wandered the hills with a car tyre around its neck for at least two years has at last been freed

The fourandahalfyearold  270kg 600lb  bull elk was spotted near Pine Junction southwest of Denver on Saturday evening and tranquillised according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife

Officers with the agency had to cut off the elks fivepoint antlers to remove the object because they couldnt slice through the steel in the bead of the tyre

We would have preferred to cut the tyre and leave the antlers for his rutting activity but the situation was dynamic and we had to just get the tyre off in any way possible officer Scott Murdoch said

Authorities explained that the rutting season  when a male elk looks to mate with female elk  played a role in helping officers find him

Murdoch said The rut definitely made him more visible There was a bigger bull in the group he was with on Saturday but he is getting to be a decent size bull

Wildlife officers first spotted the elk in July 2019 while conducting a population survey for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the Mount Evans Wilderness It has since spent the past couple of years travelling back and forth between Park and Jefferson counties

They estimate that the elk was freed of about 16kg 35lb in weight and were surprised to see its neck was in good condition after two years of chafing

The hair was rubbed off a little bit there was one small open wound maybe the size of a nickel or quarter but other than that it looked really good Murdoch said I was actually quite shocked to see how good it looked

In the past the officer have seen deer elk moose bears and other wildlife have become entangled in a number of items including swing sets hammocks clotheslines decorative or holiday lighting furniture tomato cages chicken feeders laundry baskets soccer goals and volleyball nets

You may have been hearing the word blackfishing more and more recently The definition above is how journalist Wanna Thompson  who is credited with coining the term  described it to CNN

Blackfishing rose to prominence in 2018 when Thompson said she noticed white celebrities and influencers cosplaying as black women

Its always been prevalent Thompson says Be it fashion beauty or music Black is cool unless youre actually black

The word has been appearing a lot in headlines at the moment in connection with former Little Mix band member Jesy Nelson She has frequently faced accusations of blackfishing altering her hair lips and skin tone to appear racially ambiguous and singing in a blaccent

In response to the latest claims during an Instagram Live with rapper Nicki Minaj to promote their new single Boyz Nelson said she never intended to cause offence and wanted to celebrate the music she loves and has grown up with

Minaj also defended the former Little Mix star saying Yall gotta stop She added on Twitter If you know someone has been suicidal from bullying in the past why try to get a bunch of people to bully them again about something else

Nelson is not the first star to be called out for allegedly blackfishing people like Kim Kardashian Iggy Azalea Ariana Grande Selena Gomez and Bhad Bhabie have all faced accusations of pretending to be black or mixedrace

Its about picking and choosing common black traits and characteristics for ones benefit explains Johanna Yaovi the founder of The Curl Talk Project while we continue to face discrimination on a day to day basis

As black women we are constantly fighting for clear authentic representation and diversity and then have to face individuals who do blackfishing individuals who will therefore look ambiguous enough for brands to use them as emblems for diversity

Expect us

Hundreds of protesters led by Indigenous activists from across the country demonstrated in front of the White House yesterday to demand that Joe Biden stop approving fossil fuel projects and declare the climate crisis a national emergency

The rally marks the start of five days of demonstrations calling for greater attention to climate injustices as Native American leaders and tribal members head to the capital to publicize their demands

Outside the White House the words Expect Us were spraypainted on the base of a statue of Andrew Jackson the seventh US president who is infamous for among other things leading the violent and lethal repression of Native American peoples in a displacement known as the Trail of Tears

Expect Us is part of the phrase Respect Us or Expect Us which many Indigenous women have been using while demonstrating against the Canadian oil company Enbridges 9bn upgrade of an oil pipeline designed to carry oil from Alberta Canada to Wisconsin

The Indigenous Environmental Network  a broad alliance of tribes Indigenous rights groups labor organizations and others  have criticized Biden for not moving to block Enbridges Line 3 replacement project

IEN said theyd had enough of Bidens empty words and urged him to swiftly mitigate the climate chaos that has engulfed our communities

Mondays demonstrations fell on a federal holiday in the US that until recently was officially dedicated to Christopher Columbus However spurred by national calls for racial equity and decolonization communities across the country have over the years paired or replaced it with Indigenous Peoples Day

The demonstration was mostly peaceful although protesters were subjected to police use of a longrange acoustic device which emits a piercing sound according to video footage captured by Indigenous campaigners There were also a few arrests

71 of boys feared they teased if they played with what they described as girls toys according to a new survey by Lego

It has prompted the worlds largest toymaker to confirm it will remove gender stereotypes from its products

The company surveyed almost 7000 parents and children aged six to 14 from China the Czech Republic Japan Poland Russia UK and the US

It found attitudes to play and future careers remain unequal and restrictive

The survey showed that while girls were becoming more confident and keen to engage in a wide range of activities almost third quarters of boys who took part feared they would be made fun of if they played with what they described as girls toys  a fear shared by their parents

The study found that parents still encouraged sons to do sports or Stem activities while daughters were offered dance and dressing up girls were five times more likely to be encouraged in these activities than boys or baking three times more likely to be encouraged

Madeline Di Nonno the chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media who conducted the research said this showed behaviours associated with men are valued more highly in society Until societies recognise that behaviours and activities typically associated with women are as valuable or important parents and children will be tentative to embrace them

The Danish toymaker said it no longer labels any of its products for girls or for boys and customers can no longer search for products by gender online Instead the Lego website offers themes that it calls passion points

Brazils president Jair Bolsonaro has been accused of showing contempt for the dignity of vulnerable women by vetoing a plan to distribute free sanitary pads and tampons to disadvantaged girls and women

The plan was expected to benefit 56 million women including homeless people prisoners and teenage girls at state schools It is estimated period poverty keeps one in four girls out of school in the country

Tabata Amaral of the Democratic Labour party PDT and one of 34 crossparty federal deputies who coauthored the bill slammed the decision Bolsonaro says this project is against the public interest  I say that what is against the public interest is that girls lose around six weeks of school a year because they are menstruating

In May a report by the UN childrens fund Unicef and population fund UNFPA found that 713000 girls in Brazil live without access to a bathroom about 4 million girls dont have adequate hygiene facilities at school such as sanitary pads and soap and at least 200000 girls lack even the minimum hygiene facilities at school such as bathrooms

The news that unvaccinated pregnant women now make up nearly 20 of Englands most critically ill Covid patients is a damning indictment of the lack of attention given to this vulnerable group as restrictions have eased said Sarah McMullen director of impact and engagement at parenting charity NCT in response to new figures

One in six patients requiring the NHSs highest form of lifesaving care are unvaccinated pregnant women with Covid

Twenty of the 118 patients with Covid who received extra corporeal membrane oxygenation Ecmo between July and September were motherstobe NHS England said Of these 19 had not had a jab and the other had only had one dose of a vaccine

NHS England released the statistics as part of a renewed effort to persuade pregnant women to get fully vaccinated amid new evidence from doctors in Israel that Covid can cause serious problems for the mothertobe and her baby in the later stages of pregnancy

The new data also underline extra risks facing unvaccinated people Of the 118 men and women who had Ecmo in those three months 107 had not been jabbed four had only had one dose and only seven were fully immunised

This is another stark reminder that the Covid19 jab can keep you your baby and your loved ones safe and out of hospital said Jacqueline DunkleyBent NHS Englands chief midwifery officer

Experts in pregnancy and womens health NHS leaders and ministers have been concerned at the number of motherstobe who have not been immunised amid unfounded fears  partly fuelled by antivax campaigners  that getting jabbed could harm the mother her baby or both

This comes as new peerreviewed evidence published on Monday showed that pregnant women with Covid19 are more likely to suffer from gestational diabetes lower white blood cell counts and heavier breathing during and after birth

The disease can also increase the risk of newborns struggling to breathe according to the study of 2471 women by Dr Elior Eliasiof the Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Israel Our findings support the importance of vaccinating all pregnant women at all stages of pregnancy he said

Have you reduced how much meat you eat

Britons have cut their meat consumption by 17 over the past decade but will need to double these efforts if they are to meet targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production set out earlier this year

Meat production is a major contributor to global heating and land degradation while eating lots of red and processed meat has been linked to a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer

For these reasons the governmentcommissioned national food strategy for England recently recommended that people try to cut their meat consumption by about 30 within the next decade

To understand how much meat people in the UK are currently eating Cristina Stewart a health behaviours researcher at the University of Oxford and colleagues turned to dietary data recorded in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey This annual exercise involves asking a nationally representative sample of the population to keep a food diary for four consecutive days

The analysis found that between 20089 and 201819 participants average meat consumption decreased from about 103g per person a day to 86g a reduction of about 17g or 17 This is equivalent to eating roughly two and a half fewer pork sausages each week

There was an absolute reduction of 137g of red meat and 7g processed meat and a 32g increase in white meat consumption

Stewart said I think the reductions that were seeing are positive but were moving pretty slowly and if we continue reducing our intake at the same rate were not really going to be reaching these dietary targets

Victoria Taylor senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation said We need to look beyond meat to benefit from the full range of protein sources available to us Including plantbased proteins like beans lentils nuts and seeds or using these to bulk out meat dishes can be a healthy way to cut down on the amount of red and processed meat you are eating

The 2021 Nobel peace price has been awarded to two journalists and free speech activists Maria Ressa from the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov from Russia

Maria Ressa is a FilipinoAmerican journalist and author the cofounder and CEO of Rappler who spent nearly two decades as an investigative reporter in southeast Asia for CNN 

In 2020 she was convicted of cyberlibel under a controversial Philippine law against cybercrime a move widely condemned by rights groups and journalists as an attack on press freedom

The Guardian published this editorial about Ressa last year calling her a courageous journalist and her conviction a move designed to chill the media

Dmitry Muratov is a Russian journalist and one of the founders of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta described by the Committee to Protect Journalists as the only truly critical newspaper with national influence in Russia today

Muratov won an International Press Freedom Award in 2007 for his courage in defending press freedom in the face of attacks threats and imprisonment

Announcing the award the Nobel committee chair Berit ReissAndersen said Free independent and factbased journalism serves to protect against abuse of power lies and war propaganda Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time

Pope Francis has said he is shamed by the Catholic churchs failure to deal with paedophile priests in France

A landmark report on Tuesday found that at least 330000 children were sexually abused by clergy and lay members of church institutions in France over the past 70 years

The pope conceded that the church had failed to put the needs of victims first in what was considered to be one of his strongest condemnations of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church to date

There is unfortunately a considerable number he said during his weekly audience at the Vatican on Wednesday I would like to express to the victims my sadness and pain for the trauma that they suffered It is also my shame our shame for the incapacity of the church for too long to put them at the centre of its concerns

The independent inquiry was Frances first major reckoning with clerical child sexual abuse It found an estimated 216000 children were victims of sexual violence by French Catholic priests deacons and other clergy from 1950 to 2020 When considering lay members of the church such as teachers at Catholic schools the figure rose to at least 330000

In the wake of the damning findings Hans Zollner a German priest and close adviser to Pope Francis urged Italian bishops to find the courage to investigate clerical child abuse

The Catholic church in other countries must now find the same courage as in France I hope in Italy too Zollner said in an interview with La Repubblica

In January 2019 a UN commission condemned Italy for being complicit in protecting paedophile priests from criminal charges and called for the country to devise a national plan to prevent the sexual abuse of children

The numbers in France are frightening but here we could have up to 1 million victims Simply hearing Im sorry is laughable said Francesco Zanardi who set up Rete lAbuso Italys only network of clerical abuse victims

Whats sad is that a lot of cases arent taken too seriously Its just another Black girl said Jennifer Redmond whose 19yearold daughter Sarayah Jade was killed last September

To families of victims and local activists the release of new data on the number of Black women and girls who were murdered per day in the US last year is just the latest reminder that violence against them often goes ignored  and that it should be made a more urgent public priority

According to statistics released by the FBI last week at least four Black women and girls were murdered per day in 2020 a sharp increase compared with the year before

The FBI recorded at least 405 additional murders of Black women and girls last year as homicide surged across the country and experts caution that even that stark number probably represents an undercount

The increase in murders of Black women comes as the overall US murder rate rose nearly 30 during the pandemic the biggest jump in six decades

The rising murder rate has affected Black women across the country Baltimore Maryland recorded the highestever number of women killed in 2020 with at least 48 women murdered throughout the year many of them Black

Advocates and experts said the stark rise makes it clear its time to address the factors that have long made Black women face a three times higher homicide rate than white women as well as why their risk of being murdered increased sharply last year

Black women and girls have been indoctrinated to believe everyone matters but themselves said Rosa Page the founder of the advocacy group Black Femicide US

When things get rough Black women are the first to be harmed said Ori Monroe an organiser with Black Femicide US and cofounder of Black Women LeadBlack Femme Fund

Its being hailed as a breakthrough for science

The World Health Organization has recommended the widespread rollout of the first malaria vaccine in a move experts hope could save tens of thousands of childrens lives each year across Africa

Calling it an historic day the WHOs director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that after a successful pilot programme in three African countries the RTSS vaccine should be made available more widely

The RTSS vaccine also known as Mosquirix was developed by the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline GSK and has been administered to more than 800000 children in Ghana Kenya and Malawi since the pilot programme began in 2019

Using this vaccine in addition to existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year said Tedros on Wednesday It is safe It significantly reduces lifethreatening severe malaria and we estimate it to be highly costeffective

He added Malaria has been with us for millennia and the dream of a malaria vaccine has been a longheld but unattainable dream Today the RTSS malaria vaccine more than 30 years in the making changes the course of public health history We still have a very long road to travel But this is a long stride down that road

Noting the role played by GSK in the development of the RTSS vaccine Gareth Jenkins director of advocacy at the charity Malaria No More called on the UK government to continue to invest in cuttingedge research that could finally bring about a zeromalaria world

There have been fears that decades of progress towards ending malaria has stalled with some countries such as Eritrea and Sudan seeing significant resurgences in recent years In 2019 409000 people died from the mosquitoborne parasite disease most of them in Africa More than 270000 of the victims were children under five

Experts hope the WHOs announcement will reenergise the race to find other vaccines a quest that has been going on for almost a century

How many toys names do you think your pet can remember

Our dogs might follow commands such as sit or become uncontrollably excited at the mention of the word walkies but when it comes to recalling the names of their toys and other everyday items most seem pretty absentminded

Now a study of six genius dogs has advanced our understanding of dogs memories suggesting some of them possess a remarkable grasp of the human language

Hungarian researchers spent more than two years scouring the globe for dogs who could recognise the names of their various toys

Although most can learn commands to some degree learning the names of items appears to be a very different task with most dogs unable to master this skill

Max Hungary Gaia Brazil Nalani Netherlands Squall US Whisky Norway and Rico Spain made the cut after proving they knew the names of more than 28 toys with some knowing more than 100

They were then enlisted to take part in a series of livestreamed experiments known as the Genius Dog Challenge

All of the dogs taking part were border collies  herding dogs originally bred to work sheep Although this makes many of them very responsive to the behaviour of their owners only a small proportion of the breed are able to memorise the names of their toys

Neither is this talent unique to border collies Thanks to the Genius Dog Challenge we have managed until now to find also dogs from other breeds including a German shepherd a pekingese a mini Australian shepherd and a few dogs of mixed breeds said researcher Dr Shany Dror from the Etvs Lornd University Separate research has also suggested some Yorkshire terriers may be able to do it

Dogs are good models for studying human behaviour as they evolved and develop in the human environment said one of the studys coauthors Prof dm Miklsi at Etvs Lornd University With these talented dogs we have a unique opportunity to study how another species understands the human language and how learning words influences the way we think about the world

What do these sculptures make you think of

They form the first permanent artwork to honour the Windrush generation in the UK and were unveiled in the east London borough of Hackney on Friday to mark the first day of Black History Month

The artist Veronica Ryan pictured on the second slide created three sculptures in bronze and marble of Caribbean fruits Custard Apple Annonaceae Breadfruit Moraceae and Soursop Annonaceae

Ryan says the use of these fruits ties into the narrative of migration and movement I grew up in the 1950s My parents moved between London and Watford I remember some of the complexities my parents had during the 1950s I remembered my mum and some of her friends discovering Ridley Road market and my mother bought fabrics and threads I remembered some of the fruits and vegetables

She hopes the artwork will foster a sense of ownership amongst the local community and provide a vital public space to celebrate their cultural heritage

Im hoping that the community will recognise themselves through my choices Through breadfruit soursop a custard apple that the community will say Oh my goodness oh I know those Those are things we grew on trees back home she said

Carole Williams the lead member for the councils response to the Windrush scandal described the permanent artwork as another step on the road to doing the work that we committed to do as a council when we passed the comprehensive Windrush motion back in 2018 which was the first of its kind in the country

The motion has two strands policy work that calls for an end to the hostile environment policies challenging the impact it continues to have on the Windrush generation and their descendants and celebrating and honouring the community

Dominic Raab has rejected the idea that misogyny should become a hate crime in the wake of Sarah Everards murder but then appeared confused about its meaning as he suggested it could apply to abuse against either women or men

The justice secretary and deputy PM who has said he is not a feminist and previously complained about the raw deal men are getting said it was his number one priority to make sure women feel confident in the justice system

Pressed on BBC Breakfast about whether misogyny should be a hate crime Raab appeared not to understand the term as he said misogyny is absolutely wrong whether its a man against a woman or a woman against a man Misogyny is hatred aimed specifically against women and some campaigners would like to see it criminalised

Questioned about his confusion Raab said What I meant was if we are talking about things below the level of public order offences of harassment intimidation which are rightly criminalised  if we are talking about effectively insults with a sexist basis I dont think that criminalising those sorts of things will deal with the problem that we have got at the heart of the Sarah Everard case

He said the problem was with enforcement rather than a lack of laws supporting Boris Johnsons views that a hate crime of misogyny was not necessary

Sickle cell disease has defined me defined my body and made a big dent to my dreams  No matter how hard I fight it continues to defeat me A new treatment brings hope and might make dreaming possible again

Thats what Toks Odesanmi a finance specialist and patient at Cambridge University hospitals trust said after the NHS announced that thousands of people in England are to benefit from the first new therapy for two decades for the serious and lifelong health condition

Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder  particularly common in people with an African or Caribbean background  characterised by red blood cells that assume an abnormal rigid curved shape resembling a sickle It can cause severe pain and organ failure often requiring hospital admissions

Crizanlizumab a revolutionary lifechanging drug treatment is delivered by a transfusion drip and works by binding to a protein in the blood cells to prevent the restriction of blood and oxygen supply The therapy will help at least 5000 people over the next three years officials said

Current treatments to prevent sickle cell crises include a tablet called hydroxycarbamide and regular blood transfusions but these are not always effective for people with severe forms of the disease

This revolutionary treatment will help to save lives allow patients to have a better quality of life and reduce trips to AE by almost half said Amanda Pritchard chief executive of NHS England

A former Facebook employee has accused the company of putting profit over the public good after coming forward as the whistleblower who leaked a cache of internal documents that have placed the tech firm in its worst crisis since the Cambridge Analytica scandal

Frances Haugen  who is due to testify in Congress today  came forward on Sunday as the whistleblower behind a series of damaging reports in the Wall Street Journal that have heaped further political pressure on the tech giant Haugen told the news program 60 Minutes that Facebooks priority was making money over doing what was good for the public

She has been called to testify before the US Senates commerce subcommittee on the risks the companys products pose to children Lawmakers called the hearing in response to a Wall Street Journal story based on Haugens documents that showed Facebook was aware of the damage its Instagram app was causing to teen mental health and wellbeing

Haugen will argue that Facebooks closed design means it has no oversight even from its own oversight board a regulatory group that was formed in 2020 to make decisions independent of Facebooks corporate leadership She also alleges that Facebooks decision to prematurely reinstate old algorithms valuing engagement above all else contributed to the 6 January attack on the Capitol building

As soon as the election was over they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before to prioritise growth over safety And that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me she said

As the details of Everards case unfolded womens sense of despair and anger heightened

The hope that her murder would bring about rapid change all but evaporated On 18 September nearly seven months after the 33yearold was killed a member of the public found the body of the schoolteacher Sabina Nessa in Cator Park in southeast London

In addition to Nessa another 80 women were killed by men in 28 weeks in the UK according to Karen Ingala Smith of the Counting Dead Women project That brings the total for 2021 to at least 109 which she is sure is an underestimate

After Sarah was killed there was a big outcry and people said it felt like a sea change but I just I cant see it like that she said

In between Sarah and Sabina there were so many women killed and we dont have a huge outpouring of anger and empathy and grief for every one As a society we seem to find these deaths as somehow acceptable

She noted that whilst sentencing Wayne Couzens Lord Justice Fulford had called Everard a wholly blameless victim implying other women killed at the hands of men may not be so blameless

Murders by strangers attract much greater attention than stories of women killed by someone they know although they are significantly less common

Those deaths are just a fraction of the violent incidents faced by women in the UK The last year saw a global and national increase in domestic violence and an increase in rape reports whilst the number of prosecutions has collapsed

Thousands of women across the US joined nationwide protests against the Texas abortion law demanding continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy

Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court shouting My body my choice and cheering loudly to the beat of drums

Its the first Womens March since Joe Biden became president The day before the march his administration urged a federal judge to block the nations most restrictive abortion law which has banned most abortions in Texas since early September

It is one of a series of cases that will give the nations divided high court occasion to uphold or overrule Roe v Wade

The abortionthemed demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term for the supreme court that will decide the future of abortion rights in the US after appointments of justices by Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court

The Womens March has become a regular event although interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic since millions of women demonstrated in the US and around the world the day after Trumps inauguration in January 2017

Trump endorsed punishing women for getting abortions and made appointment of conservative judges a mission of his presidency

This portrait is of Moody He was living in his broken down truck in Las Vegas in 2017 when this picture was taken

The image is part of a new social documentary photography project aiming to authentically capture homeless communities in America

Inspired by her own experience living outside Thilde Jensens pictures document the stories of those living on the streets from Nevada to New York

After becoming friends with two homeless people who lived under a highway in Syracuse New York in 2014 Jensen began her project portraying homelessness as the social cost of a system valuing profit over human welfare

Jensen herself spent two years living out of a tent in the woods after becoming sick She had been living well and working hard but had not made enough money to cover health insurance and she had no American safety net to catch her

Most of the homeless people I met had life stories so full of trauma and neglect that I was surprised they had made it this far Jensen said

An unkind world and a system not designed to help them succeed had deeply scarred many of them They feel cast out unwanted invisible forgotten

Jensens exhibition  I AM NOT INVisible  is part of the inaugural brsphotofest at the martinparrfdn Bristol England until 19 December

For some it is a source of shame  and a trigger for frequent mirror checks is my hairline receding Is there a thin patch on top of my head

But for the acclaimed photographer Rankin and the conceptual artists Scott Kelly and Ben Polkinghorne male baldness is something to celebrate

Their Baldpieces project a series of portraits of men adorned with striking headwear focuses on masculine beauty and challenges an enduring taboo

Twothirds of men begin to lose hair on their heads by the age of 35 By the age of 50 85 of men will have significantly thinner hair

Kelly and Polkinhorne made hundreds of sketches of male pattern baldness before whittling them down to eight shapes They then collaborated with headpiece designers to create magnificent crowns to adorn balding crowns

With Rankins involvement they put out casting calls for balding men to be photographed Because of the stigma we were amazed there were men willing to come forward said Kelly

Rankin a globally renowned portrait and fashion photographer whose subjects have included the Queen David Bowie the Rolling Stones and Madonna said the headpieces were brilliant in their originality

There is a taboo around baldness  we dont particularly talk to other men about it apart from taking the mickey he said This project was trying to create something new and say its OK to be bald Its so confronting  yet so unashamedly masculine

What do you think governments should be doing to combat loneliness

With its campaign One Against Loneliness the Dutch government has encouraged organisations businesses and towns to find solutions to a growing number of people feeling lonely particularly among the elderly

The Netherlands has around 13m people over the age of 75 half of whom said they regularly feel lonely

Enter Kletskassa which translates to chat checkout The concept began a couple of years ago at the supermarket chain Jumbo

After noticing a positive response from customers the chain has now announced there will be chat checkouts in 200 stores across The Netherlands

Colette Cloostermanvan Eerd CCO of Jumbo said Our stores are an important meeting place for many people and we want to play a role in identifying and reducing loneliness

We are proud that many of our cashiers like to take a seat behind a Kletskassa They support the initiative and want to help people to make real contact with them out of genuine interest It is a small gesture but very valuable especially in a world that is digitizing and getting faster and faster

This is far from just a Dutch problem Globally 41 of people reported becoming lonelier over the previous six months from March 2020

Berlin has had what is being called a watershed moment

Citizens gathered enough signatures to trigger a referendum on whether to take properties back from mega landlords those who own over 3000 properties in their city

The referendum took place earlier this week and was backed with a majority in favour of putting around 11 of all apartments in Berlin back into state ownership

This sets a major precedent for many other cities that now find themselves in a housing crisis

The horned crocodilefaced hell heron is one of two exciting new species of dinosaur to have been unearthed off the coast of England

Found on the Isle of Wight the 125 millionyearold predator officially named Ceratosuchops inferodios had a 9 metrelong body powerful claws a gigantic skull covered in horns and bumps and long crocodilelike teeth

The fearsome creature lived on the fringes of ancient floodplains where it would have lain in wait for aquatic prey research suggests

Scientists say the discovery along with the skeleton of a second species at the same site offers unique insights into how the Spinosauridae family of dinosaurs made the transition from landdwelling to semiaquatic predators over a period of tens of millions of years

This is a really exciting piece of news for the dinosaur world as these are some of the most charismatic and enigmatic predators said Neil Gostling of the University of Southampton who supervised the project

The new finds also cemented the Isle of Wights status as the best place in Europe to find dinosaurs he added

The fact they have these crocodilelike teeth which are good for catching slippery fish means we suspect they were standing in the water and using their jaws to hunt said Gostling

Another possibility is that the dinosaurs would have waited semisubmerged like a crocodile or used their large claws to hook fish out of the water like a bear

In bright sunshine on Wednesday a choir from the school Betty Campbell led with distinction sang her favourite song Something Inside So Strong as a huge bronze monument to her was unveiled in a Cardiff city centre square

Campbell was the first black woman to become a headteacher in Wales

Under her leadership Mount Stuart primary in Butetown Cardiff became a model for best practice in equality and multicultural education throughout the UK

But the joyful unveiling was also important because the monument is the first statue of a real named woman set up in an openair public space in Wales

Campbells daughter Elaine Clarke said her mother who died in 2017 aged 82 would have been proud of the monument

She recalled how as a child growing up in the Tiger Bay area of Cardiff Campbell had been told that a black workingclass woman could never reach the academic heights to which she aspired  but she had proved them wrong

This sculpture encapsulates Bettys legacy of determination aspiration and inspiration she said

Campbells family were present at the unveiling including great granddaughter Ezrae Campbell who can be seen sitting on the base of the statue on the last slide of this post

Granddaughter Michelle CampbellDavies said there were still too few teachers of colour and the education system was letting down students from black Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds But she called the statue a beacon of hope

Seeing a statue of a black Welsh woman means that change can happen

According to new study air pollution is likely to have been responsible for up to 6 million premature births and 3 million underweight babies worldwide every year

The research published in the journal Plos Medicine is the first to calculate the total global burden of outdoor and indoor air pollution combined

By looking at the results of multiple scientific studies the study found that indoor air pollution exposure appears to carry a much higher burden compared to outdoor levels

Indoor pollution mostly from cooking stoves burning solid fuel such as coal or wood made up almost twothirds of the total pollution burden on pregnancies in 2019

This is especially true in developing areas such as in some parts of southeast Asia and subSaharan Africa

More than 92 of the global population lives in areas where the outdoor air quality is below recommended limits set by the World Health Organization and about 49 are exposed to equally high levels of indoor air pollution

Regions such as south and east Asia are the most polluted with Bangladesh China India and Pakistan home to 49 of the 50 of the most polluted cities worldwide

In recent years wildfires agricultural fires and dust storms have also caused extensive air pollution

By minimising air pollution in southeast Asia and subSaharan Africa the study calculated that the number of premature births and babies with low birth weight could be reduced by almost 78 globally

The ivorybilled woodpecker  pictured above  and 22 more birds fish and other species are expected to be declared extinct by the US Fish and Wildlife Service

Its a rare move for wildlife officials to give up hope on a plant or animal but government scientists have exhausted efforts to find these 23 species and warned that the climate crisis on top of other pressures could make such disappearances more common

Each of these 23 species represents a permanent loss to our nations natural heritage and to global biodiversity Bridget Fahey who oversees species classification for the Fish and Wildlife Service told the New York Times Its a sobering reminder that extinction is a consequence of humancaused environmental change he said

The ivorybilled woodpecker was perhaps the best known species the US Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday will announce is extinct

It went out stubbornly and with fanfare making unconfirmed appearances in recent decades that ignited a frenzy of ultimately fruitless searches in the swamps of Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi and Florida

Around the globe some 902 species have been documented as extinct

The actual number is thought to be much higher because some are never formally identified and many scientists warn the earth is in an extinction crisis with flora and fauna now disappearing at 1000 times the historical rate

The factors behind the disappearances vary  too much development water pollution logging competition from invasive species birds killed for feathers and animals captured by private collectors In each case humans were the ultimate cause

But several scientists are staying positive saying that its possible one or more of the 23 species included in Wednesdays announcement could reappear

The eating of dog meat has long been a traditional practice in South Korea but has increasingly become an international embarrassment

The South Korean president Moon Jaein has now raised the idea of banning doing so in the country  where an estimated 1 million dogs are believed to be eaten annually

Consumption has already been declining as more people embrace the animals as companions rather than livestock  and during a weekly meeting with the prime minister Kim Bookyum earlier this week the president said the time has come for the practice to end

Moon who has several canines at the presidential compound including one dog he rescued after taking office made his latest remarks as he was briefed on a plan to improve the care system for abandoned pets

South Koreas animal protection law is intended mainly to prevent the cruel slaughter of dogs and cats but does not ban consumption itself

Scientists have found what they called environmentally damaging levels of illegal drugs  including MDMA and cocaine  in the river running through Glastonbury festival owing to people peeing on the land instead of using the toilets and urinals on the site

Researchers measured levels of illegal drugs in the river before during and after the last Glastonbury festival in 2019 comparing levels upstream and downstream of the event

After the festival three years ago drug levels in River Whitelake were high enough to harm aquatic wildlife including a rare eel population according to the report

It found that the amount of MDMA was 104 times greater downstream than upstream in the weeks after the festival rising to levels that could harm the life cycle of European eels a protected species

Cocaine concentration was 40 times higher downstream although the levels of cocaine were not considered harmful to aquatic life

Ahead of the 2019 festival Glastonburys organisers launched a campaign Dont Pee on the Land to raise awareness of the environmental damage caused by public urination on Worthy farm

Peeing on the land at Glastonbury causes pollution of the water table which can affect local wildlife and fish they tweeted in June 2019 The Environment Agency have the power to close the site if there is too much pollution Please only pee in the hundreds of toilets and urinals on site

In response to the new research Glastonburys spokesperson described public urination as the biggest threat to our waterways and the wildlife for which they provide a habitat

Greta Thunberg has slammed global leaders over their promises to address the climate emergency dismissing them as blah blah blah

In a speech to the Youth4Climate summit in Milan Italy today Thunberg quoted statements by UK prime minister Boris Johnson This is not some expensive politically correct green act of bunny hugging and Narendra Modi Fighting climate change calls for innovation cooperation and willpower but said the science did not lie

Of course we need constructive dialogue said gretathunberg But theyve now had 30 years of blah blah blah and where has that led us We can still turn this around  it is entirely possible It will take immediate drastic annual emission reductions But not if things go on like today Our leaders intentional lack of action is a betrayal toward all present and future generations

The Cop26 climate summit starts in Glasgow UK on 31 October and all the bigpolluting countries must deliver tougher pledges to cut emissions to keep the goal of 15C within reach

Carbon emissions are on track to rise by 16 by 2030 according to the UN rather than fall by half which is the cut needed to keep global heating under the internationally agreed limit of 15C

Research published on Monday showed that children born today would experience many times more extreme heatwaves and other climate disasters over their lifetimes than their grandparents even if countries fulfil their current emissions pledges

Thunberg vanessanakate1 from Uganda and hundreds of other young people from across the world are attending the Youth4Climate Summit It is hosted by the Italian government the UKs partner in running Cop26

Thunberg said They invite cherrypicked young people to meetings like this to pretend that they listen to us But they clearly dont listen to us Our emissions are still rising The science doesnt lie

We can no longer let the people in power decide what is politically possible We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is Hope is not passive Hope is not blah blah blah Hope is telling the truth Hope is taking action And hope always comes from the people
What do you think of this statue

The sculpture of a woman in a transparent dress from a 19thcentury poem has sparked controversy in Italy

The bronze statue was unveiled on Saturday in the town of Sapri during a ceremony attended by the former prime minister Giuseppe Conte surrounded by a mostly male entourage

The work by the sculptor Emanuele Stifano is a tribute to La Spigolatrice di Sapri The Gleaner of Sapri written by the poet Luigi Mercantini in 1857 The poem is based on the story of a failed expedition against the Kingdom of Naples by Carlo Pisacane one of the first Italian socialist thinkers

But a group of female politicians from the centreleft Democratic party have called for the statue to be knocked down They argue it reflects nothing of the antiBourbon revolution nor the selfdetermination of a woman who chooses not to go to work in order to take sides against the oppressor

Laura Boldrini a deputy with the party said the statue was an offence to women and the history it should celebrate

Meanwhile Stifano has defended his work in a Facebook post saying it was useless to try to explain artwork to those who absolutely only want to see depravity

The 54yearold singer was accused of running a Chicagobased criminal enterprise that recruited women and children and subjected them to unwanted sex and mental torment

Multiple witnesses said Kelly had forced them to obey perverse and brutal whims when they were underage in a scheme that stretched back more than two decades

Gloria Allred a lawyer for some of Kellys victims said that of all the predators shes gone after  a list including Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein  Mr Kelly is the worst

R Kelly thought that he could get away with all of this but he didnt Allred said outside the courthouse

Breastfeeding could play an important role in helping to protect babies from Covid

New research suggests that breastfeeding women who have been infected with the virus continue to produce virusneutralising antibodies into their milk for up to 10 months

Its believed these antibodies can be used to treat people with severe Covid preventing their condition from getting worse

Although young children are less at risk of developing severe Covid than older people or those with underlying health conditions approximately one in 10 infants under the age of one will require significant hospital care if they become infected

The antibodies in breast milk are somewhat different to the Immunoglobulin G IgG antibodies that predominate in blood and are triggered by vaccination The main antibody is Secretory Immunoglobulin A IgA which sticks to the lining of babies respiratory and intestinal tracts helping to block viruses and bacteria from entering their bodies

Although researchers had previously detected coronavirus antibodies in breast milk it was unclear whether they could neutralise the virus or how long women continue to produce them after encountering coronavirus

Dr Rebecca Powell who led the research in New York says This is the breastfeeding population so knowing if there are antibodies in the milk how long theyll be protective after being infected or which vaccine is going to give your baby the best antibody protection is very important information and will be relevant for a long time to come

A milestone for equality

Swiss voters have decided by a clear margin to legalise marriage for samesex couples in a referendum on Sunday  making it one of the last countries in Western Europe to do so

Official results showed the measure passed with 641 of voters in favour and won a majority in all of Switzerlands 26 cantons  the countrys administrative provinces

Switzerlands parliament and the governing federal council supported the Marriage for All measure and prereferendum polls showed solid backing The country has authorised samesex civil partnerships since 2007

Supporters said approval would put samesex partners on an equal legal footing with heterosexual couples by allowing them to adopt children together and facilitating citizenship for samesex spouses It would also permit lesbian couples to use regulated sperm donation

Amnesty International welcomed the move as a milestone for equality

The Alpine nation which has a population of 85 million is traditionally conservative and only extended full voting rights to women in federal elections in 1971 with one canton holding out on full voting rights for municipal elections until 1990

The latest samesex referendum result is welcome news but the topic does continue to divide the continent Most countries in western Europe already recognise samesex marriage but most of those in central and Eastern Europe do not allow wedlock involving two men or two women

Switzerland is the worlds 30th country to adopt samesex marriages

So these are some of the contenders in an annual competition to find Chinas ugliest buildings

The hall of shame listing of Chinas top 10 ugliest buildings has kicked off with 87 bizarre designs in the running including a violinshaped church and an Inner Mongolia hotel in the form of a monstrous babushka doll

Over the past 11 years a Chinese architecture website archcycom has been inviting people to vote in the lighthearted annual contest that it hopes will encourage people to ponder the flexible notion of beauty

For years China has been an experimental ground for ambitious domestic and international architects with mixed results

There is a national broadcaster building in Beijing designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas that is called big pants by Chinese social media users as it looks like a pair of legs image three

This years competition comes as the central government becomes more prescriptive about architecture In April the national development and reform commission NDRC banned the construction of ugly buildings

The official intervention triggered further curiosity among Chinas internet users On Weibo the hashtag BanningUglyArchitecture has been viewed 170m times Users have also been sharing photos of what they consider unattractive buildings across the country

With todays action we want to send two messages  that we dont believe that rhino horns have any medicinal value and that we only believe in preserving the living rhinos

In aid of World Rhino Day nearly 2500 rare rhino horns that were confiscated by authorities were burned in public in Assam India

This is the first ceremony of its kind in northeastern India and is part of an antipoaching drive

Since the signing of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 1977 trade in rhino horn has been banned

But there is still demand in China and Vietnam where it is sometimes promoted as a wonder ingredient in traditional medicine

In South Africa alone 769 rhinos were poached in 2018 and there have also been attempts to steal rhino horns from museums in Europe

A rhino horn has supreme value only when it is intact to the living rhino These horns have no value Assams Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said

Bokakhat Assam is near the UNESCOlisted heritage site Kaziranga National Park home to more than 2000 onehorned rhinos  the worlds biggest population

The collection of horns that were burned had been kept in storage by the government since 1969 some seized from poachers and others removed from rhinos that died from natural causes

One of the founders of the Taliban and the chief enforcer of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law when they last ruled Afghanistan has said the hardline movement will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands though perhaps not in public

In an interview with Associated Press Mullah Nooruddin Turabi dismissed outrage over the Talibans executions in the past which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium and warned the world against interfering with Afghanistans new rulers

Everyone criticised us for the punishments in the stadium but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments Turabi said in Kabul No one will tell us what our laws should be We will follow Islam and we will make our laws on the Quran

Since the Taliban overran Kabul on 15 August and seized control of the country Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will recreate their harsh rule of the late 1990s

Turabis comments pointed to how the groups leaders remain entrenched in a deeply conservative hardline worldview even if they are embracing technological changes such as video and mobile phones

Executions of convicted murderers were usually by a single shot to the head carried out by the victims family who had the option of accepting blood money and allowing the culprit to live

For convicted thieves the punishment was amputation of a hand For those convicted of highway robbery a hand and a foot were amputated

Trials and convictions were rarely public and the judiciary was weighted in favor of Islamic clerics whose knowledge of the law was limited to religious injunctions

Turabi said that this time judges  including women  would adjudicate cases but the foundation of Afghanistans laws will be the Quran He said the same punishments would be revived

Cutting off of hands is very necessary for security he said saying it had a deterrent effect He said the cabinet was studying whether to carry out punishments in public and will develop a policy

Strict coronavirus measures have made it difficult to be a taxi driver in Thailand

But some of Bangkoks outofwork drivers are making the most out of their taxis being left idle by setting up mini vegetable gardens

The taxi graveyard has been set up to help feed drivers who are struggling to find fares

The site is owned by Ratchapruk Taxi Garage which has seen most of its drivers quit Bangkok for their home villages because fares have dried up following lockdown restrictions

Thailands Covid restrictions to deal with a deadly spike in cases in recent months include a nighttime curfew and the tourism industry which the Bangkoks taxi trade heavily relies on has declined rapidly because of the countrys strict arrival rules

Vegetables being grown on the cars include eggplants chillies cucumbers courgettes and basil Any surplus crops will be sold at local markets

The evacuation of people on the Canary island of La Palma continues as the ongoing volcanic eruption has pushed streams of lava towards inhabited coastal areas

The eruption which began on Sunday afternoon has destroyed at least 183 homes and led to the evacuation of at least 6000 people to date

Fresh drone footage shows lava advancing down the volcanos western flank towards the sea Experts say that if and when the lava reaches the sea it could trigger more explosions and clouds of toxic gases

Spains prime minister Pedro Snchez paid tribute to the extraordinary work of the emergency workers deployed on La Palma and said their efforts had kept people on the island safe

But warnings to stay away from the magma and the volcano have not been universally heeded with visitors flocking to catch a glimpse of the eruption

No deaths or injuries have been reported but the eruption is worrying banana farmers and grape growers in the region who fear their businesses will be affected

Her journey should have taken just over five minutes and she is thought to have been murdered

Her body was found near the OneSpace community centre at Kidbrooke Park Road in the Royal Borough of Greenwich on Saturday

A man in his 40s who was arrested on suspicion of killing her has been released under further investigation

The London mayor Sadiq Khan said violence against women was a national epidemic Appearing on ITVs Good Morning Britain he said Between last years International Womens Day and this years International Womens Day 180 women were killed at the hands of men across the country

We do have an epidemic when it comes to violence against women and girls I think us men have got to be allies in addressing this issue

Colleagues and neighbours have paid tribute to Nessa Her colleague Lisa Williams the head of Rushey Green primary school in Lewisham called her a brilliant teacher and said the school had been left devastated

A vigil will be held at 7pm on Friday evening in Pegler Square for Nessa supported by the group Reclaim These Streets which organised a similar vigil after the murder of Sarah Everard in March

Anna Birley one of the groups organisers said Nessas death was more tragic evidence that urgent changes were needed

For too long the burden of womens safety has been on women  it shouldnt take yet another murder of a woman to change that she said Since March weve seen a lot of reports and little action  a woman dies at the hands of a man every three days in this country so the time for reports and platitudes is over and the time for action is long overdue

A man named Serbest Salih is behind an unique project in Turkey where children most of them refugees have been given analogue cameras and taught the art of photography

He is one of an estimated 100000 refugees living in the historic city of Mardin in southeastern Turkey just a few miles from the Syrian border

And his life changed dramatically in 2017 when he discovered a sprawling refugee community living in a group of abandoned government buildings in the workingclass Kurdish district of Istayson

It was a place where Turkish and Syrian Kurds lived as neighbours but did not communicate They were strangers who spoke the same language It was at that moment I thought to use analogue photography as a means to integrate the different communities

Salih studied photography at college in Aleppo before fleeing Syria with his family in 2014 as Islamic State fighters advanced on his home town of Kobani

Children from the age of seven come to his workshops to learn the traditional skills of shooting on film and processing the results in a darkroom

The results as a new book i saw the air fly shows are often surprising
Rather than reflect the traumas of their displacement the pictures tend towards the innocent and joyous family portraits blurred shots of their friends at play children jumping hiding posing with their friends or tending their animals

When they start using them something magical happens They start to show the world they live in through their own eyes

People think that if you give a refugee child a camera the results will be sad but instead most of these photographs are all about joy They are small moments of private happiness

All proceeds from the sale of i saw the air fly will go to the Her Yerde SanatSirkhane charity whose aim is to provide a safe friendly and embracing environment for children caught up in conflicts

Could this move democratise air travel

South Americas superrich have long used them to hop between luxury beach properties ranches and heavily guarded compounds

But now the skies over Latin Americas largest city are set to witness a futuristic aerospace revolution after the Brazilian budget airline Gol struck a deal that could see it ferry commuters around So Paulo in hundreds of lowcost zeroemission electric air taxis

Few cities are crying out for such a revolution more than So Paulo a sprawling metropolis with more than 12 million inhabitants and choked by a fleet of 86m vehicles

Stephen Fitzpatrick the head of the British aerospace manufacturer that produces the aircraft Vertical Aerospace said the flying taxis would be ideal for Brazils biggest city and will transform how we travel around high population density cities that are clogged with traffic

It is designed for people who have difficulty in finding a comfortable space to work in their home and dont want to get in the way of their family the creators of this minimalist office said

Japanese design is renowned for its minimalism and for keeping things simple and uncluttered

So its no surprise that a leading housebuilder is trying to tackle the lack of space for pandemicera working from home by marketing a tiny homeoffice building that can be constructed adjacent to houses in just two days weather permitting

The socalled Hanare Zen is a 91cmwide and 18 metrelong building equipped with power sockets a countertype desk and very little else

KI Star Real Estate a popular housebuilder began taking orders for the Hanare Zen on 6 September hoping to find a market among those struggling to work in cramped homes

Hanare means separate or detached in Japanese while Zenzen is written in both the Chinese character for Zen Buddhism and the alphabet

We had already created the Hanare building as a kind of storage space and with the situation in the pandemic the idea came about to develop the Hanare Zen as a work space said Chisa Uchiyama a spokesperson for KI Star Real Estate The use of Zen in the name represents the minimalist concept of stripping down the size and features to only what is necessary

The Hanare Zen will cost you 547800 yen 3600 and is available in Tokyo and the surrounding areas

For some of the 70 of Tokyos population that live in apartments and would be unable to use a construction like the Hanare Zen working in their cars has become one way to find some peace and quiet to toil in

Demand is up for a range of accessories to support invehicle working including stands for computers that fit onto steering wheels folding desks minifans portable batteries and screens for windows to block outside distractions

107 years and 300 days old makes sisters Umeno Sumiyama and Koume Kodama the oldest ever identical twins the world has seen

They were born on November 5 1913 on Shodo Island in Japan and were the third and fourth siblings of a family with 11 children

According to the Guinness World Records the pair were separated as children and rarely met up until they reached 70

Living about 190 miles apart they saw one another mostly at weddings and funerals But when they turned 70 they reconnected and started making Buddhist pilgrimages together

Previous record holders Kin and Gin also from Japan had held the title of oldest identical twins at 107 years and 175 days since Kins death in January 2000 Gin died the following year aged 108

Sumiyama and Kodama are now living in separate care homes and their families said the twins are sociable and positive and that they often joked about surpassing the age of Kin Narita and Gin Kanie

Because of Covid measures their world record certificates were mailed to their nursing homes and Sumiyama reportedly was in tears when she received hers while Kodamas memory has faded and she couldnt fully understand the significance of it

Japan has one of the highest life expectancy in the world of 8467 years The oldest living person on record was 118yearold Japanese woman Kane Tanaka

The US has reached a grim coronavirus milestone

Covid19 has now killed as many Americans as the 191819 flu pandemic  more than 675000

The US population a century ago was just onethird of what it is today meaning the flu cut a much bigger more lethal swath through the country

But the Covid19 crisis is by any measure a colossal tragedy in its own right especially given the incredible advances in scientific knowledge since then and the failure to take maximum advantage of the vaccines available this time

Big pockets of American society  and worse their leaders  have thrown this away said Dr Howard Markel a medical historian at the University of Michigan

While the Delta variantfueled surge in infections may have peaked US deaths are more than 1900 a day on average  the highest level since early March  and the countrys overall toll topped 675000 Monday according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University though the real number is believed to be higher

Winter may bring a new surge with the University of Washingtons influential model projecting an additional 100000 or so Americans will die of Covid19 by 1 January which would bring the overall US toll to 776000

50 million people lost their lives during the 1918 pandemic at a time when the worlds population was only one quarter of todays number

The global toll from the Covid pandemic stands at over 46 million currently

We know that all pandemics come to an end said Dr Jeremy Brown director of emergency care research at the National Institutes of Health who wrote a book on influenza They can do terrible things while theyre raging

Covid19 could have been far less lethal in the US if more people had gotten vaccinated faster and we still have an opportunity to turn it around Brown said We often lose sight of how lucky we are to take these things for granted

The global production of food is responsible for a third of all planetheating gases emitted by human activity a major new study has found

Meanwhile the report revealed that use of animals for meat causes 60 of this pollution which is twice that of plantbased foods

The entire system of food production such as the use of farming machinery spraying of fertilizer and transportation of products causes 173bn metric tonnes of greenhouse gases a year according to the research This enormous release of gases that fuel the climate crisis is more than double the entire emissions of the US and represents 35 of all global emissions researchers said

The emissions are at the higher end of what we expected it was a little bit of a surprise said Atul Jain a climate scientist at the University of Illinois and coauthor of the paper published in Nature Food This study shows the entire cycle of the food production system and policymakers may want to use the results to think about how to control greenhouse gas emissions

The raising and culling of animals for food is far worse for the climate than growing and processing fruits and vegetables for people to eat the research found confirming previous findings on the outsized impact that meat production particularly beef has on the environment

How do these images make you feel

These images are all taken by underwater photographers who are determined to show us the oceans silent struggle

Whether its a moray eel tangled in a ghost fishing line or lizardfish attempting to eat a cigarette end the Ocean photography awards are a window into how human behaviour is affecting marine life

Kerim Sabuncuolu won an award for his image of a moray eel that suffocated after becoming entangled in a fishing line He witnessed the result of whats known as ghost fishing When a fisherman leaves his equipment under the water like a fishing net or line it keeps on killing fish for many years to come he explains If I had left this moray eel some other fish would have eaten the hook and died as well

Its a worldwide problem Ghost fishing gear accounts for around an estimated 10 of all marine litter

The National Geographic photographer and conservationist Cristina Mittermaier was among the judges who picked Sabuncuolu as the ocean conservation photographer of the year Its a fantastic image she says

Underwater wildlife communicate in a very different way to terrestrial wildlife and they dont have the same facial expressions that an animal like a grizzly bear might have Therefore making images that create an emotional connection with humans when youre photographing fish is really hard In this image the photographer was able to capture a dramatic moment and the eel actually has a facial expression that conveys emotion It caught me as soon as I saw it

The award was for her breakout hit show I May Destroy You which is about a young writer named Arabella whos drugged and raped and embarks on a quest for justice and selfknowledge

Coel is the first Black woman to win the award but as a whole the Emmys showed a diversity problem still remains  handing almost all the acting awards to white performers

The awards had a diverse lineup of presenters and nominees across the board But the likes of Billy Porter and Mj Rodriguez from Pose the late Michael K Williams from Lovecraft Country and Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang from Saturday Night Live all went home emptyhanded

Which altmilk do you think is the most popular

New research suggests that one in three people in Britain are now choosing plantbased milk alternatives  with analysts saying the uptake is being driven by environmental and health considerations

Shoppers spent 100m more in 2020 on altmilks made from oats almonds or soya turning it into a near 400mayear market

The findings from Mintel said 32 of those polled drank plantbased milk which was up from 25 in 2020  and it is even higher among 25 to 44yearolds at 44

A quarter of the 2000 people who took part in the research also said the pandemic had made eating vegan or plantbased food and drink more appealing to them For the under35s that figure rose to 38

The report also revealed that oat milk had become the plantbased milk of choice overtaking almond to become the biggest seller in 2020

The average persons milk consumption in the UK has fallen 50 since the 1950s however it soared on the back of pandemic lifestyle changes with sales up by 100m to 32bn

According to a 2018 study a glass of dairy milk produces almost three times more greenhouse gas than any plantbased milk But vegan options have drawbacks of their own  so what milk should we drink

Despite how big or small Antartica looks on a map its actually about 13 times as large as Europe and almost double the size of Australia

Now scientists say the hole in the ozone layer and is this year bigger than the size of the continent

Ozone exists about seven to 25 miles 1140km above the Earths surface in the stratosphere and acts like a sunscreen for the planet shielding it from ultraviolet radiation

Researchers from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service who are responsible for monitoring the hole which develops annually said it is rather larger than usual

Every year a hole forms during the late winter of the southern hemisphere as the sun causes ozonedepleting reactions which involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from humanmade compounds

VincentHenri Peuch the services director told the Guardian The 2021 ozone hole is now among the 25 largest in our records since 1979 but the process is still under way

A large or small ozone hole in one year does not necessarily mean that the overall recovery process is not going ahead as expected but it can signal that special attention needs to be paid and research can be directed to study the reasons behind a specific ozone hole event

Scientists accept that the depletion in the ozone layer is caused by humanmade gases called CFCs which were first developed in the 1930s for use in refrigeration systems and were then deployed as propellants in aerosol spray cans

Last month separate research found these ozonewrecking chemicals would have driven 25C of extra warming by 2100 if they had not been outlawed and that banning them has given us a fighting chance of limiting global heating to 15C as set out by the Paris agreement

CFCs have been banned in 197 countries around the world  and since then the ozone layer has shown signs of recovery but it is a slow process and it is is expected to take until the 2060s or 70s for a complete phasingout of the depleting substances

So how do Afghan women dress then This is how

Those are the words of BBC journalist Sana Safi  one of hundreds of Afghan women around the world who have joined an online campaign sharing photos of themselves wearing traditional colourful clothes using the hashtag DoNotTouchMyClothes

The protest is a response to a sitdown demonstration orchestrated by the Taliban at Kabul University where about 300 women appeared in allblack garments covering their faces hands and feet  the sort of dress previously never seen across the country

Waving Taliban flags the women said they supported the militants who have announced that women would not be allowed to hold highranking government positions and that schools and universities needed to be gendersegregated

Since the Taliban took the capital Kabul it has set up an allmale interim government Many Afghan women especially in urban centres fear that their hardgained freedoms might be limited remembering the 1996 to 2001 Taliban regime that saw women largely confined to their homes

Dr Bahar Jalali an Afghan historian and gender studies expert posted the first photo using the DoNotTouchMyClothes hashtag which has since inspired Afghan women across the globe

Peymana Assad the first person of Afghan origin to be elected to public office in the UK posted a photo of herself in colourful garments as seen on the fourth slide and tweeted This is Afghan culture My traditional dress

Despite the Talibans announcement that further protests would only be allowed if approved by the ministry of justice women in Kabul have pledged to continue their demonstrations

Even the staunchest defenders of traditional whaling in the Faroe Islands have condemned the cruel and unnecessary massacre of nearly 1500 dolphins on Sunday which has been described as the largest single killing of dolphins or pilot whales in the islands history

The dolphins were driven into shallow waters of the Sklabotnur beach on the island of Eysturoy and left writhing for hours before being killed

The scale of the killing was such that even many Faroese who frequently view the traditional Faroese Grind hunt as part of their cultural heritage expressed disgust

The Grind is significant for many Faroese people with spectators coming out to watch from the shore and the meat from the catch traditionally shared among the families that participated with any excess then spread among local villagers

But one local told the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet that there was no way that locals would want to consume this much dolphin meat and that most of the dolphins will be thrown in the trash or in a hole in the ground

Captain Alex Cornelissen the global chief executive of the Sea Shepherd group which has been campaigning to stop the traditional Faroese Grind hunt since the 1980s said that in the midst of a global pandemic it was absolutely appalling to see an attack on nature of this scale in the Faroe Islands

US gymnasts including Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney offered emotional testimonies on Tuesday at a senate hearing into the Larry Nassar abuse scandal

Nassar a former USA Gymnastics team doctor is serving an effective life sentence after abusing dozens of athletes under his care In moving scenes his victims appeared in front of a senate committee to give searing testimonies on his abuse and the failure of the FBI to properly investigate it

Biles began her testimony with a quote from Nelson Mandela that There can be no keener revelation of a societys soul than the way in which it treats its children She briefly had to pause after becoming overcome with emotion before she continued

To be clear I blame Larry Nassar and I also blame an entire system that enabled and perpetrated his abuse she said USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee knew that I was abused by their official team doctor long before I was ever made aware of their knowledge

Biles widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time withdrew from several events at this summers Olympics to maintain her mental health She acknowledged on Tuesday that the legacy of Nassars abuse had affected her

The FBI is accused of failing to properly investigate allegations that Nassar was abusing athletes in his care Children suffered needlessly because multiple agents in multiple offices at the FBI neglected to share the Nassar allegations with their law enforcement counterparts at state and local agencies Republican senator Chuck Grassley said in prepared remarks before the hearing

The cultural icon rupaulofficial has become the first drag queen to be forever enshrined as a soldier fly

The RuPaul fly is part of a new Australian genus named Opaluma from the Latin words for opal and thorn because they look like little gems buzzing around the forest floor and have a distinctive thorn tucked under their abdomen

It is 50th species to be named by csirogram entomologist Bryan Lessard A decade ago the first insect he named after a pop culture icon was the Beyonc fly  Scaptia beyonceae in 2011

At the time it caused quite a stir and was frowned upon by some taxonomists but brytheflyguy said the growing naming practice had helped threatened species gain attention in response to environmental threats such as climate change

Lessard said naming the soldier fly Opaluma rupaul came as an obvious decision

I was watching a lot of RuPauls Drag Race while examining the species and I know it would challenge RuPaul on the runway serving fierce looks Lessard said

It has a costume of shiny metallic rainbow colours and it has legs for days I think once Ru sees the fly shell realise its quite fierce and hopefully appreciate the name

He hopes CSIROs work will encourage citizen scientists and conservationists to help to monitor wildlife and insects part of a national push for scientists to document and name every Australian species

We really need to encourage next generation to help us name and describe and protect our unique biodiversity in Australia

When the Canadian comedian Norm Macdonald who has passed away aged 61 wasnt spinning out hilarious yarns he was often delighting crowds with his incisive observations dad jokes and oneliners

If you havent watched some of the long sidesplitting stories he told on talk shows or seen the glint in his eye as he prepared to make a hilariously awkward remark then you may want to head to YouTube when you can

It was always hard to tell when Macdonald was being serious and when he was joking even when talking about illness and death But often the line between sincerity and humour were naturally blurred with Macdonalds candid perspective on the world and gift for comedy two inseparable parts of his personality and appeal

I am absolutely devastated about Norm Macdonald tweeted Conan OBrien whose talk show Macdonald regularly appeared on Norm had the most unique comedic voice I have ever encountered and he was so relentlessly and uncompromisingly funny I will never laugh that hard again Im so sad for all of us today

Do you recognise this sculpture A little a least

The lifesize bronze artwork is based on Leonardo da Vincis Mona Lisa  and has just gone on public display in Bristol  butt has already divided some opinion among artlovers

The Moona Lisa is a reimagined version of acclaimed street artist Nick Walkers spray painting on the same subject as seen on the second slide which sold for 54000 at Londons Bonhams auction house in 2008

Walker created the original painting in response to a challenge from Banksy  a fellow artist and Bristolian  who said nothing more could be done with the Mona Lisa

To create the 3D piece a rig comprising of 160 DSLR cameras was constructed which captured a 360 image of a live model dressed as the Moona Lisa

From this image a digital model was created which was then used as the mould for the final bronze sculpture

The 260kg piece can be found at the vanguardstreetart at the M Shed bristolmuseums until 31 October a show that celebrates the role Bristols artists have played in the development of British street art

Four in 10 young people around the world are hesitant to have children as a result of global heating and fear that governments are doing too little to prevent climate catastrophe a poll in 10 countries has found

Nearly six in 10 young people aged 16 to 25 were very or extremely worried about climate change according to the scientific study  the biggest yet on climate anxiety and young people

A similar number said governments were not protecting them the planet or future generations and felt betrayed by the older generation and governments

Young climate activists said feelings of anxiety over the climate were now widespread among todays youth

Mitzi Tan 23 from the Philippines said I grew up being afraid of drowning in my own bedroom Society tells me that this anxiety is an irrational fear that needs to be overcome one that meditation and healthy coping mechanisms will fix At its root our climate anxiety comes from this deepset feeling of betrayal because of government inaction To truly address our growing climate anxiety we need justice

The poll of about 10000 young people covered Australia Brazil Finland France India Nigeria the Philippines Portugal the UK and the US It was paid for by the campaigning organisation Avaaz

Threequarters of those who took part agreed with the statement the future is frightening and more than half felt they would have fewer opportunities than their parents

Nearly half reported feeling distressed or anxious about the climate in a way that was affecting their daily lives and functioning

Earlier this month Unicef found that children and young people around the world were bearing the brunt of the climate crisis with 1 billion children at extreme risk from the impacts of climate breakdown

Halima Aden the trailblazing SomaliAmerican modest fashion model who quit last year has said she felt like one of the biggest tokens in the fashion industry

Before she announced her departure last November the model had made a name for herself by scoring many industry firsts

In 2017 halima was the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of a US magazine Allure she was the first to wear the head covering on the cover of British Vogue a year later and in 2019 the first to wear a burkini on the cover of Sports Illustrated

Now Aden says she felt she had to compromise to fit into the industry Despite me saying Dont change yourself change the game that was exactly what I was doing she told the Times

Im not saying its not right for other Muslim hijabwearing women Im saying it was not right for me I wear a hijab Im a Muslim Im Somali so yes all these identities set me up to be the perfect token to check all the boxes I felt like one of the biggest tokens in the industry I always felt like an outsider in my own career

In July she spoke of the internal conflict she felt in the last two years of her career My hijab kept shrinking and got smaller and smaller with each shoot she told the BBC

The former model also spoke about a horrendous magazine cover that made her look like a white mans fetishised version of me She didnt name the publication

Last week she announced her return to the fashion industry not as a model but as a designer Aden signed a twoyear contract with the modest fashion label Modanisa and her first designs for Halima X Modanisa include headscarves In a statement she said Modanisa shares my faith and values and fully respects my choices as a Muslim woman

Could controlling toilet habits of cows be the key to more environmentally friendly farming

In Germany one herd has been pottytrained in an experiment to teach calves to use a toilet area in their barn meaning that urine could be collected and treated

Scientists trained the cows via a system of rewards and mild punishments When they urinated in the assigned area they were given a sweet drink or some mashed barley and when they relieved themselves elsewhere they were surprised by a short blast of water from above

Waste from cattle farms often contaminates soil and waterways and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and the acidification of soil

For this reason toilettraining cattle has long been viewed as desirable but several previous attempts have been unsuccessful

Within a few weeks after about 15 training sessions 11 out of the 16 calves in the experiment had been successfully toilettrained according to the study published in the journal Current Biology

Cattle like many other animals are quite clever and they can learn a lot said Jan Langbein an animal psychologist at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology FBN in Germany Why shouldnt they be able to learn how to use a toilet

Langbein said a future ambition would be to teach cows to also defecate in a toilet area

The ammonia produced in cow urine doesnt directly contribute to the climate crisis but when it leaches into the soil microbes convert it into nitrous oxide which is the third most significant greenhouse gas after methane and carbon dioxide

What do they say about cats having nine lives

This feline seemingly used one up here surviving a dramatic fall after somehow getting into Miami Gardens the University of Miamis stadium for a college football match 

The cat was filmed dangling from an upper stand for a couple of seconds As the crowd looked on some quick thinking spectators thankfully used an American flag as a makeshift net to cushion the animals fall

The stadium tweeted after the event saying we wish the cat the best in its remaining eight lives

Theres high fashion  and then theres higher taxes fashion as AOC has shown at this years Met Gala 

The New York congresswoman turned heads at the annual event wearing a white gown by Brother Vellies containing a notsohidden message tax the rich

It was AOCs first appearance at the ball and as you might expect has sparked a somewhat predictable yet fierce debate on social media

While many have embraced AOCs fashion statement many of her critics have once again accused her of hypocrisy due to the costly and luxurious nature of the event and partying with the elites she wants to tax 

But what do you think Does wanting the rich to pay more in taxes mean you cant party with them Should AOC have protested outside instead Or is it ok to endorse a wealth tax while also attending such a glitzy event As Yale professor Jason Stanley tweeted AOC is in fact pushing legislation to tax the rich Good for her for making it cool Thats why shes going to win 

However you may also be indifferent and agree more with Melania Trump who in 2018 famously wore a jacket emblazoned with the message I really dont care do u

Either way the debate over whether democratic socialists can have nice things rages on

A hospital in New York will at least temporarily stop delivering babies later this month after too many employees resigned over a rule that made Covid19 vaccinations compulsory

The number of resignations received leaves us no choice but to pause delivering babies at Lewis county general hospital chief executive of the Lewis County Health System told reporters

Amid alarm over the highly infectious Delta variant and continued evidence that vaccines are both safe and effective New York state has required healthcare workers to be vaccinated

The mandate makes room for medical exemptions but excludes religious ones Hospitals and nursing homes must comply by 27 September

Nearly three quarters of staff in the Lewis County Health System have received the jab including 30 employees after the mandate was announced in August But another 30 have resigned  21 from clinical areas  and 165 remain unvaccinated leaders say

Already chronically shortstaffed the Lewis county general hospital maternity department took a debilitating hit after six employees resigned from the obstetrics service Another seven are still deciding whether to get vaccinated or leave

Patients may now have to rely on other facilities for maternity and postpartum care Other departments are at risk and the hospital strongly encourages staff to get the shot

Picture this youre 18 taking in the sights of New York City and then you spot it  a huge billboard of yourself celebrating the biggest win of your career

Thats what today looked like for US Open champion Emma Raducanu

She emerged from her hotel following three weeks of experiencing the city primarily through Uber Eats having made tennis history Keen to do some sightseeing after becoming the first British woman to win a grand slam in 44 years the teenager stepped out and was met with a giant poster of her triumph

In three months she has gone from being a student waiting for her Alevel results to reaching the last 16 at Wimbledon and then in unprecedented fashion to winning 10 straight matches to qualify for the main draw at the US Open and then go all the way to the title

Born in Toronto when emmaraducanu was two her family moved to southeast London England I think that the calmness and the mental strength definitely comes from my upbringing she said following her victory over Leyla Fernandez on Saturday

Raducanu was introduced to tennis by her parents at the age of five and enjoyed ballet horse riding swimming gokarting and motocross and her love of cars helped her relax between matches at the US Open as she watched the Dutch Grand Prix

And when she played in Chicago just before winning her first grand slam Raducanu revealed her love of architecture finding time to visit the Bean Anish Kapoors sculpture

For many players it can be easy to forget that there is life outside the tennis bubble other things to keep your mind occupied and settled But Raducanus secret seems to be to embrace everything from culture to food friends and family to travel music to F1

I definitely think its the time to just switch off from any future thoughts or any plans any schedule she said after her win when asked where she would be playing next Ive got absolutely no clue Right now no care in the world Im just loving life

This is 12yearold Francisco Vera

At the beginning of the year the young environmentalist was sent anonymous death threats on Twitter after calling for better access to education for children during the coronavirus pandemic

The news caused outrage in Colombia and made headlines around the world But nine months later nobody has been arrested  and the fear and anxiety caused have not gone away

Even though Francisco is a child his mother Ana Maria Manzanares knows her sons activism puts him at risk from groups that would rather he remained quiet I am always watching out The threat might never materialise But from the moment youre told about it in a country like Colombia you expect anything could happen at any moment

In 2020 for the second year running the South American country was the most deadly in the world for environmental defenders according to Global Witness which recorded 65 killings

Manzanares says she had anticipated threats over her sons campaigning but had not expected them to come so soon Even so she does not want to stand in the way of her sons passion for nature

Francisco is a wellknown environmentalist and defender of his countrys extraordinary biodiversity that stretches from the high Andes to the Caribbean and Pacific coasts He uses his social media profiles which have thousands of followers to campaign against fracking and mining

After the death threats in January the Colombian government gave Francisco a bodyguard But his mother says what they really want is for someone to be brought to justice

Please let me hug my family before its too late

Thats the title of a petition that has been signed by over 240000 people demanding a new law ending isolation for care home residents with many saying care operators are still refusing to follow government advice and are imposing their own stricter regimes

100yearold care home resident Frances Heaton has issued a video plea for greater freedom complaining that thousands of people can go to pop festivals but she is being prevented from seeing two of her children at her home in Yorkshire

Government guidance is that every care home resident in England can have an unlimited number of named visitors who will be able to enter the care home for regular visits after negative tests and they can also nominate one essential care giver who undergoes regular testing who may visit the home to attend to essential care needs

Hundreds of families are to protest in Westminster next week over restrictions on residents access to their families in care homes and the lack of legal visiting rights after 18 months of lockdowns The protest organised by the Rights for Residents campaign group will be led by the actor Ruthie Henshall whose mother Gloria died recently after isolation in a care home that allowed only window visits

My name is Frances Heaton said in the message from her room I was 100 years old in March After 18 months of being shut out from the outsider world my daughter can now see me in my room But my other daughter and my son are not allowed in my room But 90000 people can visit the Leeds Festival Human rights and equality are out of order altogether

Jenny Morrison the cofounder of Rights for Residents said Some people are paying 8000 a month in care fees and havent got the right to decide who comes into their home We feel that if social care is going to be reformed they should look at the rights of people in care homes and the responsibilities of people that look after them

What do you reckon Will you be buying a pair

An entirely new way for people to stay connected to the world around them and truly be present in lifes most important moments is how the smart glasses are being pitched by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth

You can take calls listen to podcasts and take images or video but there is no augmented reality layered on top of the real world Building true augmented reality is the ultimate goal of Facebooks Reality Labs division

The frames are just a few millimetres thicker than a standard pair of Wayfarers and each wing of the glasses hides a camera which combine to shoot still images and video of up to 30 seconds with a long or short tap of the devices only button

The glasses dont actually come from Facebook at all Instead the company is working with RayBan on whose classic Wayfarer designs the hardware has been modelled and the device will be branded as a RayBan product first and foremost

If the whole thing sounds and looks familiar its because the concept bears a heavy resemblance to Snapchats Spectacles now in their third generation

We believe that this will be the first pair of smart glasses people will truly want to wear says Facebooks Monisha Perkash

An experiment that hung rhinos upsidedown to see if it was better for the animals has been awarded one of this years Ig Nobel prizes

Groundbreaking studies into how well beards soften punches to the face as well as orgasms as a nasal decongestant were honoured on Thursday night with one of the most coveted awards in science

Not to be confused with the more prestigious  and lucrative  Nobel awards to be announced from Stockholm and Oslo next month the Ig Nobels celebrate the quirkier realms of science rewarding research that first makes people laugh and then makes them think

The transportation prize went to a group that found airlifting tranquilised rhinoceroses upside down is probably better for them than carrying them on their sides in slings

Wildlife veterinarian Robin Radcliffe from Cornell University and colleagues hung 12 rhinos upsidedown for 10 minutes in Namibia because they wanted to know if the health of the animals might be compromised when slung by their legs beneath a helicopter

Rhinos are being increasingly transported in African conservation efforts to shift the animals between fragmented habitats This study wanted to ensure that the upsidedown methods being used were safe

The scientist looked at the tranquillised animals heart and lung function while being carried upside down and found there was evidence that it was better than lying chest down or on their side

This has really changed rhino translocation and even more so elephant translocation Picking these big animals up by their feet  its now accepted The next thing weve got to do is some research on other species like buffalo hippo and maybe even giraffe said teammember and wildlife doctor Pete Morkel to BBC News

A new form of influence government which uses sensitive personal data to craft campaigns aimed at altering behaviour has been supercharged by the rise of big tech firms researchers have warned

A Guardian exclusive by technology editor Alex Hern reveals that a shift to this new brand of governance comes from a marriage between the introduction of psychological nudge theory in policymaking and an online advertising infrastructure that opens up huge opportunities to run targeted campaigns

It is unacceptable that women cannot protect themselves  because they cannot afford it

Frances health minister has announced that women under the age of 25 will be offered free contraception from next year

Olivier Vran said they would not not be charged for medical appointments tests or other medical procedures related to birth control

Explaining the move Vran said that studies had shown this was the age that many women were dropping contraception not because they wanted to have children but because it is expensive

Contraception has been free in France for those aged between 15 and 18 since 2013 and for the under15s since August 2020 This has led to a drop in the number of abortions

For women over 25 about 65 of the cost of contraception is reimbursed

The measure which covers the pill IUD devices and contraceptive implants is expected to cost Frances health system the Assurance Maladie about 21m a year

Activists in Mexico have hailed a supreme court decision to decriminalise abortion saying it would stop the legal prosecution of women who terminate their pregnancies  and those reported to the authorities after suffering miscarriages

The decision handed down unanimously on Tuesday declared that criminal sanctions for abortion in the northern state of Coahuila were unconstitutional The decision sets precedent according to lawyers involved in abortion cases and will be applicable across the country

The ruling came just days after the US supreme court refused to block a neartotal ban on abortion in Texas and has prompted speculation that women in the US state may head across the border to seek terminations

In the past two years Oaxaca Veracruz and Hidalgo followed Mexico Citys 2007 precedent and decriminalised abortion but activists say elective abortions are still difficult to obtain in those states because medical workers refuse to make the procedure available

On Wednesday one Mexican state governor announced he would release all women imprisoned for having abortions

Coahuilas governor Miguel Riquelme said in a statement the resolution will have retroactive effects and if there is any woman deprived of her freedom for the crime of abortion she must be released immediately

Activists and lawyers say the ruling is likely to bring about a change in legal culture and fewer criminal investigations as the justices based their decision on human rights arguments and a womans right to decide rather than on legal technicalities

From guardianus New York Congresswoman Alexandria OcasioCortez had to explain basic biology to Texas governor Greg Abbott after he claimed six weeks was ample time to get an abortion

Abbott inaccurately defended his states new antiabortion law saying that it does not require victims of rape and incest to carry pregnancies to term because it provides enough time for a person to get an abortion

OcasioCortez called Abbotts remarks disgusting adding I do know that he is not familiar with a female or menstruating persons body because if he was he would know you dont have six weeks

Cortez went on to explain the basic biology surrounding pregnancies and that many pregnancies are often undetected at six weeks She said In case no one has informed him before in his life six weeks pregnant means two weeks late on your period And two weeks late on your period for any person with a menstrual cycle can happen if youre stressed if your diet changes or for really no reason at all So you dont have six weeks

The law which took effect on 1 September is the most extreme antiabortion measure in the US and essentially bans most abortions offering no exceptions for rape or incest

A new photography project is putting the focus on women and how they have been affected by the criminal justice system  whether as prisoners activists or professionals

Someones Daughter curated by Jennie Ricketts and presented with the View magazine is an exhibition highlighting how female prisoners are seen and understood with the ultimate aim of reimagining the justice system

By photographing women who have been stigmatised by the law the courts and the media in the administration of justice and displaying them alongside professionals working in the criminal justice space the exhibition seeks to change how formerly incarcerated women are perceived and ultimately the way justice is served

Afghan women including the countrys national womens cricket team will be banned from playing sport under the new Taliban government according to an official in the hardline Islamist group

A new Taliban interim government drawn exclusively from loyalist ranks formally began work on Wednesday with established hardliners in all key posts and no women  despite previous promises to form an inclusive administration

And in an interview with the Australian broadcaster SBS the deputy head of the Talibans cultural commission Ahmadullah Wasiq said womens sport was considered neither appropriate or necessary

I dont think women will be allowed to play cricket because it is not necessary that women should play cricket Wasiq said

In cricket they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered Islam does not allow women to be seen like this

It is the media era and there will be photos and videos and then people watch it Islam and the Islamic Emirate Afghanistan do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed

The ban on playing sport comes amid mounting evidence that the Talibans attitude towards women has barely moderated since they were last in power despite claims to the contrary

The issue of womens rights is likely to dominate how the regime is judged by the international community with the stance on womens sport and the allmale government being ominous warning signs

In an unexpected move Britney Spears father has filed a request to terminate the controversial conservatorship that has controlled the singers life for 13 years

Jamie Spears who is the conservator of his daughters estate said recent events called into question whether she still needed a court to oversee her personal affairs and finances

Britney Spears was placed under the conservatorship a complex legal arrangement usually reserved for the very old or frail in 2008 after suffering a series of mental breakdowns

Spears has twice addressed the court in recent months describing the conservatorship as abusive She has not performed since 2018 and has said she would not return to the stage while her father was conservator

Jamie Spears representatives have previously defended the conservatorship and his role in the arrangement Her father long had control over her finances and healthcare but stepped down as a personal conservator in 2019 A licensed conservator now oversees her medical treatment and her father has maintained authority over her money

But the new filing at a court in Los Angeles states Ms Spears has told this court that she wants control of her life back without the safety rails of a conservatorship

She wants to be able to make decisions regarding her own medical care deciding when where and how often to get therapy She wants to control the money she has made from her career and spend it without supervision or oversight

She wants to be able to get married and have a baby if she so chooses In short she wants to live her life as she chooses without the constraints of a conservator or court proceeding

Britneys lawyer Mathew Rosengart said he welcomed the termination request by her father and that it was a victory and vindication for the singer before adding It appears that Mr Spears believes he can try to avoid accountability and justice including sitting for a sworn deposition and answering other discovery under oath but as we assess his filing  we will also continue to explore all options

The next hearing is scheduled for 29 September

Twenty livestock companies are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than either Germany Britain or France  and are receiving billions of dollars in financial backing to do so according to a new report by environmental campaigners

Between 2015 and 2020 global meat and dairy companies received more than US478bn in backing from 2500 investment firms banks and pension funds most of them based in North America or Europe according to the Meat Atlas which was compiled by Friends of the Earth and the European political foundation Heinrich Bll Stiftung

Although the vast majority of growth was likely to take place in the global south the biggest producers will continue to be China Brazil the USA and the members of the European Union By 2029 these countries may still produce 60 of worldwide meat output

Across the world the report says threequarters of all agricultural land is used to raise animals or the crops to feed them In Brazil alone 175m hectares is dedicated to raising cattle an area of land that is about equal to the entire agricultural area of the European Union

Raising livestock contributes significantly to carbon emissions with animal agriculture accounting for 145 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions Scientific reports have found that rich countries need huge reductions in meat and dairy consumption to tackle the climate emergency

The new report has now called for more meat industry regulation and for private banks and investors to stop financing largescale intensive animal protein production projects

Warmblooded animals are getting larger beaks legs and ears to adapt to a hotter climate and to better regulate their temperature

When animals overheat birds use their beaks and mammals use their ears to disperse the warmth Some creatures in warmer climates have historically evolved to have larger beaks or ears to get rid of heat more easily These differences are becoming more pronounced as the climate warms

If animals fail to control their body temperature they can overheat and die Beaks which are not covered by feathers and therefore not insulated are a site of significant heat exchange as are ears tails and legs in mammals if not covered by fur

The review published in the journal Trends in Ecology  Evolution found that the differences are particularly pronounced in birds

The author of the study Sara Ryding of Deakin university a bird researcher said Shapeshifting does not mean that animals are coping with climate change and that all is fine

It just means they are evolving to survive it  but were not sure what the other ecological consequences of these changes are or indeed that all species are capable of changing and surviving

While the scientists say it is difficult to pinpoint climate breakdown as the sole cause of the shapeshifting it is what the instances studied have in common across geographical regions and across a diverse array of species

Examples include several species of Australian parrot that have shown a 410 increase in bill size since 1871 positively correlated with the summer temperature each year

A statue of the explorer Christopher Columbus which stood on one of Mexico Citys main boulevards is set to be replaced by one of an indigenous woman

The citys Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said a new statue of an Olmec woman will aim to deliver social justice for the historic role of women in Mexico especially indigenous women

The Olmec people are believed to be one of the countrys first major civilisations

Columbus an Italianborn explorer has become a symbol of oppression and colonialism and the statue was a regular target of demonstrators protesting against the suppression of Mexicos Indigenous civilisations

Sculptor Pedro Reyes who has been given the job of creating the new monument said Its very important to dedicate a monument to indigenous women and to the Earth because if anyone can teach us how to take care of this planet its our native peoples and that is precisely what we must learn again

All of these people were blinded by police in May 2020 during protests following the death of George Floyd

Something in my head told me the teargas canister was the last thing Id ever see clearly Photojournalist Wil Sands writes about his experience of being shot and partially blinded with an aluminium teargas canister fired by police while he covered the Black Lives Matter protests

According to Shot in the Head a report released in September 2020 by Physicians for Human Rights during the protests between 26 May and 27 July of last year US law enforcement officials shot 115 people in the head with less lethal weapons Of these victims at least 30 suffered permanent ocular damage

Its perhaps needless to say that any eyerelated injury is basically a photographers worst nightmare tantamount to a musician going deaf Sands writes

While dealing with the aftereffects of his injury Sands came up with a new mission meet as many of the other people blinded by the police as I could

As well as a powerful photo essay the survivors are part of a growing WhatsApp group where they share solidarity news of diagnoses and the odd bit of offcolor eye humor

For the first time in my professional life I felt like my work was having a tangible impact on the world says Sands

The worlds largest lizard is threatened with extinction as rising water levels driven by the climate crisis shrink its habitat according to the latest red list update

The komodo dragon moves from vulnerable to endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species

The latest update is the first for the komodo dragon in more than 20 years It comes after the first peerreviewed paper on how global heating would affect the giant lizards concluded urgent conservation actions are required to avoid risk of extinction

The komodo dragon can only be found on a handful of Indonesian islands where they live on the edge of forest or in open savannah rarely venturing higher than 700 metres above sea level

As well as being unable to move to higher ground the komodo dragons habitat is becoming increasingly fragmented by human activity which makes populations less genetically healthy and more vulnerable

A reconstructed triceratops  nicknamed Big John  is expected to fetch up to 15m when hes auctioned off at Pariss Drouot auction house on 21 October

Approximately 66m years ago the triceratops with its massive collared skull and three attacking horns was one of the most dangerous and daunting of dinosaurs

Big John has a skull and bony collar measuring 262 metres long 2 metres wide and weighing more than 700kg two large horns measuring more than a metre and 200 other assorted bones that have been painstakingly pieced together

The herbivore lived in Laramidia an island continent that stretched from what is now Alaska to Mexico and died in an ancient flood plain now known as the Hell Creek geological formation in South Dakota As the plain is composed of sediment with no biological activity Big John was mostly fossilised and preserved

Big John over 60 complete and with a 75 complete skull is both a miracle of nature and work of art said a spokesperson for the auctioneers Giquelo

The death toll from floods and tornadoes in the US northeast rose past 40 on Thursday as authorities continued to digest the full impact of the remnants of Hurricane Ida

The storm ultimately dumped more than 9in of rain in parts of New Jersey Pennsylvania Massachusetts and Rhode Island and nearly as much on Staten Island in New York City

In New York City police said at least 13 people died one in a car and 11 in flooded basement apartments that often serve as relatively affordable homes in one of the nations most expensive housing markets

Major flooding along the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania swamped highways submerged cars and disrupted rail service

Officials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape

In Connecticut a state police sergeant perished after his cruiser was swept away A 19yearold man was killed in flooding at an apartment complex in Rockville Maryland police said

New Yorks resilience to flooding was under renewed scrutiny It was the second time in recent weeks that subway stations and streets were submerged

In a speech at the White House in Washington on Thursday Joe Biden said These extreme storms and the climate crisis are here We must be better prepared We need to act

In rainy conditions on the foothills of Mount Fuji Dame Sarah Storey completed a journey she began 29 years ago as she won her 17th gold medal to become outright the most successful British Paralympian of all time

Storey made her maiden Paralympic appearance in Barcelona as a swimmer at the age of 14 She competed in the pool at the following three games and won five gold medals before switching to cycling in 2008 Since then her success has only accelerated winning nine golds across Beijing London and Rio before her latest treble in Tokyo took her past the total set by the swimmer Mike Kenny between 1976 and 1988

Reflecting on her success is not something that comes readily to Storey who after her victory practically confirmed she intends to race again when the Paralympics head to Paris in 2024

I just wanted to be a British athlete I wanted to compete for my country for as long as I possibly could I couldnt have imagined having eight Games let alone winning medals at every Games and 17 of those medals being gold Its the dream I didnt have coming true

UPDATE The federal government has decided to match the bonus for Paralympians

In late July as soon as Emma McKeon won the first of her four gold medals at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre she was guaranteed a 20000 bonus

Last week when another Australian swimmer Lakeisha Patterson did the same thing at the same venue she received nothing

The difference One was competing at an Olympic Games and the other a Paralympics

It is through no fault of her own that McKeon is both ablebodied and highly decorated enough to qualify her for the Australian Olympic Committees lucrative cash prizes The AOC simply has the money to reward its athletes while its paracounterpart Paralympics Australia does not

Still the stark discrepancy  felt by paraathletes throughout the Paralympic cycle  has become externally apparent during the Tokyo 2020 Games Australian viewers watching more intently while in lockdown have voiced their discomfort and one ablebodied sportswoman has done something about it

Chloe Dalton who was a part of Australias gold medalwinning rugby sevens team at Rio 2016 and now plays for the AFLWs GWS Giants had read about Team USAs parity in this space with Olympic and Paralympic gold medallists each receiving 52000

I assumed it was going to be the same for Australian Paralympians she says So I was pretty shocked when it came out that they actually received nothing when they win a medal

From guardianus The most extreme abortion ban in the US has gone into effect in Texas despite legal efforts to block it  and given the supreme courts lack of intervention so far its the latest signal that Roe v Wade could soon be unraveled

A neartotal abortion ban in the southern state empowers any private citizen to sue an abortion provider who violates the law opening the floodgates to harassing and frivolous lawsuits from antiabortion vigilantes that could eventually shutter most clinics in the state

More widely the fact that the supreme court has not yet intervened over the enactment of the law which many see as unconstitutional bodes badly for an upcoming case brought by Mississippi that could overturn Roe v Wade 

So what are prochoice Americans supposed to do Kathryn Kolbert and Julie F Kay the authors of Controlling Women What We Must Do Now to Save Reproductive Freedom have an answer

First of all they say we must stop banging our heads against the supreme courts marble walls and fight for new laws at the state and federal levels

When rightwing state legislators whip up their base at the expense of reproductive freedoms we need to cry out with loud and creative protests and demand that corporations and politicians join the call for our rights they write As the supreme court diminishes Roe lets call for a blitz of laws in Democraticled states that assert abortion as a right for all who need it

Air pollution is cutting short the lives of billions of people by up to six years according to a new report making it a far greater killer than smoking car crashes or HIVAids

Coal burning is the main culprit and India is worst affected with the average citizen dying six years early

China has slashed air pollution in the last seven years but dirty air is still cutting 26 years from its peoples lifespan

Fossil fuel burning is causing air pollution and the climate crisis but nations have much greater power to cut dirty air within their own borders

The climate crisis is now also adding to air pollution by driving wildfires completing a vicious circle the scientists said

The team said recent events had illustrated the different futures possible depending on whether governments act or not

Air pollution is the greatest external threat to human health on the planet and that is not widely recognised or not recognised with the force and vigour that one might expect said Prof Michael Greenstone who developed the Air Quality Life Index AQLI which converts air pollution levels into their impact on life expectancy

Furthermore were not just letting it happen were actually causing it

He said switching to cleaner energy and enforcing air quality measures on existing power plants have cut pollution in many countries

China began a war against pollution in 2013 and has reduced levels by 29 This is adding an average of 15 years on to lives assuming the cuts are sustained the scientists said and shows rapid action is possible

Wild cockatoos have been observed using three types of tools as cutlery to extract seeds from tropical fruit

Researchers made the discovery while studying Goffins cockatoos on the Tanimbar Islands a remote archipelago in Indonesia

The team noticed the behaviour in two wild cockatoos who crafted tools from tree branches and used them to extract seed matter from sea mangoes a tropical fruit

They found that the cockatoos showed a high level of dexterity in manufacturing and using the cutlery

After observing the behaviour repeatedly and collecting some of the cutlery used by the birds the team were able to classify the tools into three types

The birds used sturdy thick twigs to wedge open a fruit and allow access to its inner portion fine tools to pierce the layer surrounding a seed like a knife and mediumsized tools to spoon out the inner seed matter

This is a great day for Irish football

The Republic of Ireland womens and mens international football teams have agreed a deal with the FAI to receive equal pay

Starting with the September World Cup qualifiers both teams will receive the same match fees for the first time

England Brazil Australia Norway and New Zealand are the countries that already pay their female and male footballers equally at international level

The Football Association of Ireland FAI said the historic move was made after talks that included team captains Seamus Coleman and Katie McCabe

The Republic mens team agreed to reduce their international fees with the FAI matching their contribution to ensure that the Senior Womens team match fee is increased

Its a major step forward from the situation four years ago when the Republic of Ireland womens team threatened to go on strike over playing and pay conditions after accusing the football association of treating them as fifth class citizens

Katie McCabe said the new deal was a huge step forward and that they had shown the world what can be achieved through unity as we offer male and female international players the same opportunities

Mens captain Coleman added that the deal is the right one for everyone who plays international football for Ireland and that the players were delighted to do what we can to ensure that our female international players are treated equally and fairly

As the sun rose over the city of New Orleans the streets quiet but for the crunch of detritus under foot residents in the citys Lower Ninth Ward awoke to assess the damage

This neighbourhood bore some of the worst scars of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 when New Orleanss levee system failed and submerged the Lower Ninth in a storey of water sweeping away lives and livelihoods

That was 16 years ago But it played heavily on many peoples minds as they hunkered down on Sunday the anniversary of Katrinas impact in Louisiana and braced for another storm

Wesley Foster a 74yearold retiree and lifelong Ninth Ward resident remembered that time vividly as he watched Ida pound the walls of the home he had rebuilt after Katrina

He had seen news reports as the storm picked up intensity over the Gulf eventually making landfall as a category 4 hurricane one of the most powerful ever to hit the US It went from one to two to three to four so quickly he said I knew it was going to be bad  but 10 hours of pounding wind 

He paused

It looked like a monster was trying to get inside

Foster was not alone in pointing to the storms rapidly increasing ferocity a growing trend in the Atlantic hurricane season that scientists link to the climate crisis

Ida formed just four days ago out in the Caribbean Sea intensifying so quickly that officials in New Orleans said they simply did not have the time to order the evacuation of the city

It came ashore with 150mph winds before trudging slowly through New Orleans and into the states capital Baton Rouge Quite simply a storm path born of nightmares

What do you think of companies like Nike and Bumble giving staff a week off to destress

Because of the pressures of the pandemic Nike has given its head office employees in the US a week off

The sportswear and trainers brand said workers at its headquarters in Oregon would be powering down until Friday with senior leaders encouraging staff to ignore all work responsibilities to aid their mental health

Take the time to unwind destress and spend time with your loved ones Do not work the Nike senior manager of global marketing science Matt Marrazzo said in an open message to staff posted on LinkedIn

He acknowledged that this past year has been rough adding that staff should recognise that were all human and living through a traumatic event

It puts Nike among a growing number of businesses offering extra time off or concessions around working responsibilities to combat the burnout caused by home working and constant video calls that have blurred the line between personal and professional lives

Whitney Wolfe Herd the founder of the dating app Bumble gave her 700 employees an extra week of paid leave to destress and switch off in June

Could this blurry yet haunting image of Maj Gen Chris Donahues lonely exit from Afghanistan come to symbolise Americas retreat from the country

Bathed in the green light of a night vision scope Donahue the final American pair of boots on the ground walked up the rear ramp of an air force C17 on Monday night

After two decades Americas last soldier left without pomp without ceremony certainly without the grandeur of victory

At precisely 1159pm Kabul time the final of five American C17s was wheels up from Afghan soil Donahue sent a final message to his troops job well done Im proud of you all

Behind Donahue blurred by the camera stands Hamid Karzai airport scene of chaos recent and distant vehicles and equipment still on the tarmac

Beyond its blast walls and razor wire lie millions of dollars more in American military materiel now in the hands of the Taliban the enemy US troops went in to fight

Coalition forces lost more than 3500 troops over 20 years The US spent more than 2tn on Afghanistan more than it contributed to the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe after the second world war

As our reporter Ben Doherty writes There was no flourishing of Afghanistan under foreign occupation More than 47000 Afghan civilians died in the conflict millions have fled as refugees to other countries Afghanistan remains the worlds largest supplier of heroin the country has consistently been ranked among the worlds least peaceful and most corrupt

Big oil coined the phrase carbon footprint to blame us for their greed  and while climateconscious individual choices are good theyre not nearly enough to save the planet More than personal virtue we need collective action writes columnist Rebecca Solnit

In her latest piece for guardianus she looks at how the very short counterargument that individual acts of thrift and abstinence  wont get us the huge distance we need to go in this decade

So what do we need to do instead 

We need to exit the age of fossil fuels reinvent our energy landscape rethink how we do almost everything

The revolution wont happen by people staying home and being good

We didnt have the ways of communicating then that we have today so everybody looked forward to coming to Notting Hill to meet other Caribbean people and to celebrate our culture

Londons first carnival was held in 1959 in response to a series of racist attacks and rioting that spread from Nottingham to west London where white youths targeted black people

It is now an indelible part of the British cultural calendar  with around a million people usually descending on west London for the celebration

For carnival institution and Queen of Mas Allyson Williams the event is a family affair In 1974 she met her husband Vernon there who founded Genesis one of Notting Hills longeststanding bands in 1980 since his death in 2002 Allyson has led the band alongside her daughter

Marrying a Trinidadian was a dream come true she says I want my children to understand our legacy the legacy of slavery where I came from to understand the culture of steel band and carnival

While technology will do its best to recreate the carnival atmosphere this August bank holiday weekend the matriarchs are already looking ahead to next years event All have given their lives to a celebration of freedom one theyre looking forward to returning to without restriction

Desperate calls from LGBTQ youths contemplating suicide or from their parents after they have made an attempt on their lives often punctuate Alexya Salvadors day When they do she drops everything to talk

As a transgender woman she recognises the anguish in their voices I feel their pain in my body because I went through this she says My family went through this

As the first transgender reverend in Latin America at the Metropolitan Community Church MCC she hopes she can use her faith to help She understands the struggle to reconcile religion and identity especially in Brazil where Christianity reigns and the church is often far from a safe space for those who are LGBTQ

According to the National Association of Travestis and Transexuals of Brazil Antra 175 trans people were killed in Brazil last year the highest number since the organisation started collecting data All were trans women and most like Salvador were black and from a low income background And this year the violence has continued In one case a trans woman was tied up in the boot of a car and beaten by two men with a piece of wood while police watched

Salvador says long before she became a pastor it was her faith that provided her with solace and strength Now its also a way for her to give others in her community the support they need To read more about her story  and the work she does in her community  click the link in bio

Blue whales the worlds largest mammals are returning to Spains Atlantic coast after an absence of more than four decades

The first one was spotted off the coast of Galicia in northwest Spain in 2017 by Bruno Daz a marine biologist who is head of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute in O Grove Galicia

Another was spotted in 2018 another the following year and then in 2020 they both returned Just over a week ago a different specimen was sited off the Islas Ces near O Grove

There was a centuriesold whaling industry and a dozen whaling ports in Galicia Spain did not ban whaling until 1986 by which time the blue whale was all but extinct in the region

Daz said it was not yet clear whether the climate crisis was leading the creatures to change their habits and return to the area out of a form of homesickness or ancestral memory Researchers believe this type of folk memory or cultural knowledge exists in many species and is key to their survival However not everyone sees the whales return as good news

Im pessimistic because theres a high possibility that climate change is having a major impact on the blue whales habitat Alfredo Lpez a marine biologist at a Galician NGO that studies marine mammals told the newspaper La Voz de Galicia

A typical blue whale is 2024 metres long and weighs 120 tonnes  equivalent to 16 elephants  but specimens of up to 30 metres and 170 tonnes have been found

Two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabuls airport One explosion took place near an airport entrance and another at a nearby hotel The Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for the attack

American forces in Kabul are bracing for more IS attacks while winding up their evacuation mission US officials say

Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie head of the US militarys Central Command told a news briefing We believe it is their desire to continue these attacks and we expect those attacks to continue  and were doing everything we can to be prepared

World Cup host Qatar has failed to investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers in the past decade according to a new report

Amnesty International said the majority of migrant worker deaths in the country are attributed to natural causes cardiac or respiratory failure classifications which are meaningless without the underlying cause of death explained according to one expert cited 

As a result as many as 70 of deaths may be unexplained In a well resourced health system it should be possible to identify the exact cause of death in all but 1 of cases the human rights organisations report said

The report described the devastating toll on the families of workers who die Under Qatar law compensation must be paid where deaths are caused by the job but the failure to properly investigate deaths means workrelated causes may not be identified Amnesty said

Qatars treatment of its migrant workforce of 2 million has come under unrelenting scrutiny since it won the right to host next years competition in 2010 In February guardiansport revealed that more than 6500 migrant workers from south Asia had died in Qatar in the past decade

Qatari authorities have claimed that the migrant mortality rate is within the expected range given the workforce size but epidemiological experts quoted in the report question this claim because of the low quality of data available They also said that migrant workers  who undergo health tests before departing for Qatar  are generally young healthy and in the prime of their lives

The right group said intense heat and humidity exposure is likely to be a significant factor and has urged the authorities to put in place better protections for workers

In response to the report the Qatar government highlighted its record on labour reforms including a new minimum wage and the removal of barriers to change jobs

It claimed to have made significant progress on tackling the effects of heat stress and said injury and mortality data were in line with international best practice setting new standards for the region

The 47yearold from Cheddleton Staffordshire who was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita which causes muscle weakness and contracture of the joints is the preeminent equestrian athlete in the history of Paralympic sport

By the time the end of this years Games comes along and Pearson has competed in both the team dressage and the individual freestyle test he could have more gold medals on his own than Germany and the United States the second and third most successful countries in Paralympic equestrian sport do between them

That he is more than that an icon of disability sport as well as an openly confidently gay athlete who performs to a global audience and has been out for decades makes the man unique

He is also just a horse rider

These remains belong to a teenager nicknamed Bess an ancient Toalean woman who died 7200 years ago in Indonesia

Archaeologists discovered ancient DNA in the remains in the Leang Panninge cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi  a find that challenges what was previously known about migration of early humans

The DNA was extracted from the petrous part of Besss temporal bone which houses the inner ear

The discovery published in the journal Nature is believed to be the first time ancient human DNA has been discovered in Wallacea the vast chain of islands and atolls in the ocean between mainland Asia and Australia

The researchers describe Bess as a genetic fossil Genetic sequencing showed she had a unique ancestral history not shared by anyone living today nor any known humans from the ancient past

Griffith Universitys Prof Adam Brumm who coled the research said the intact DNA was a rare find

The humid tropics are very unforgiving on DNA preservation in ancient human bones and teeth Brumm said

Bess is also the first known skeleton belonging to the Toalean culture a group of huntergatherers who lived in South Sulawesi between 1500 and 8000 years ago

She was around 17 to 18 years old at the time of burial Prehistoric stone tools and red ochre were found alongside her remains Her grave also contained bones of hunted wild animals

Afghanistans only boarding school for girls has temporarily relocated to Rwanda its cofounder has said just days after a video of her burning class records to avoid Taliban recriminations was widely shared on social media

Shabana BasijRasikh who escaped Kabul with 250 students and staff urged the world to not avert your eyes from the millions of girls left behind

See those girls and in doing so you will hold those holding power over them to account said BasijRasikh in a tweet as she vowed to return to Afghanistan

Another teacher Pashtana Durrani executive director of Learn Afghanistan who is now in hiding vowed she would raise an army just like the Taliban did  only mine will be of educated determined Afghan women

The Taliban leadership has sought to portray itself as more moderate than 20 years ago when it imposed a brutal rule stopping women from studying and working The have insisted women will have the right to both But reports of women being sent home from their jobs and from universities are exacerbating fears the reality will be very different

Susannah Hares a director of the Center for Global Development predicts a huge drop in school attendance despite Taliban assurances in mixed sex schools Only 16 of schools in Afghanistan are girlsonly

Aid leaders urged the international community to use their leverage of foreign aid to stop a reversal of two decades of hardwon advances in girls education

When Taliban last held power in 2001 only about 12 of primaryaged girls attended some sort of school rising to about 50 in 2015 according to an analysis of survey data by the Washingtonbased thinktank Center for Global Development In 2020 39 37 million of the 95 million children attending schools were girls

Spencer Elden who appeared as a naked baby on one of rock musics most iconic album covers  Nevermind by Nirvana  is suing the band claiming he was sexually exploited as a child

In a lawsuit filed in a Californian district court against numerous parties including the surviving members of the band Kurt Cobains widow Courtney Love and the record labels that released or distributed the album in the last three decades Elden alleges the defendants produced child pornography with the image which features him swimming naked towards a dollar bill with his genitalia visible

Elden who was four months old when the image was made says he has suffered lifelong damages from the 1991 album cover including extreme and permanent emotional distress with physical manifestations plus loss of education wages and enjoyment of life

The lawsuit claims the image is sexually graphic and says it makes Elden resemble a sex worker  grabbing for a dollar bill It claims Elden was never paid for appearing on the cover and that his parents never signed a release form for the image which was shot specifically for the album cover It has previously been reported that Elden was paid 250

In 2016 Elden recreated the image with the New York Post newspaper to mark the albums 25th anniversary saying Its cool but weird to be part of something so important that I dont even remember That year he also said Recently Ive been thinking What if I wasnt OK with my freaking penis being shown to everybody I didnt really have a choice

Robert Fisher who designed the cover said the image was inspired by Kurt Cobain seeing a documentary about babies being born underwater He thought the image would make a cool cover That vision was a bit too graphic so we went with the swimming baby instead

Elden is seeking damages of at least 150000 from each of the 15 defendants plus costs and asks that the case be tried with a jury The defendants have not yet responded to the lawsuit or commented on it publicly
This is completely unexpected behaviour and has never been seen before in wild tortoises said Dr Justin Gerlach the director of studies at Peterhouse Cambridge after a Seychelles giant tortoise a species previously thought to be a strict herbivore was filmed chasing and eating a baby bird in a horrifying and amazing attack

It was captured on film by researchers who say it was the first documented example of deliberate hunting in the wild by the species

The graphic video taken on Fregate Island in July 2020 shows a female giant tortoise slowly stalking a lesser noddy tern chick snapping at it unsuccessfully before delivering a lethal bow

Researchers think this new hunting behaviour has been driven by the unusual combination of a treenesting tern colony and a resident giant tortoise population on Seychelles Fregate island which is privately owned managed for ecotourism and home to about 3000 giant tortoises

The recordshattering rainfall that caused deadly flooding across Germany and Belgium in July was made up to nine times more likely by the climate crisis according to research

The new study also showed that humancaused global heating has made downpours in the region up to 20 heavier Last month parts of RhinelandPalatinate and North RhineWestphalia were inundated with 148 litres of rain per sq metre within 48 hours in a part of Germany that usually sees about 80 litres in the whole of July

The flooding in Germany and Belgium killed at least 222 people and caused massive damage

The new study which focused on the region around two areas that were particularly badly affected the German districts by the Ahr and Erft river was conducted by Prof Maarten van Aalst at the University of Twente in the Netherlands and 38 other scientists

They used meteorological measurements high resolution computer models and peerreviewed research methods to compare the frequency of extreme rainfall like that behind the flooding in Germany Belgium and the Netherlands in todays heated climate with the frequency expected in a world where there had been no humancaused climate change

The work reinforces the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes landmark report this month that there is unequivocal evidence that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause of worsening extreme weather

The huge human and economic costs of these floods are a stark reminder that countries around the world need to prepare for more extreme weather events and that we urgently need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid such risks from getting even further out of hand van Aalst said

In recent months there has been devastating flooding in western Europe and China extreme heatwaves in northwest America and forest fires in Russia Greece Turkey and the US

Never get in the way of an olive sea snake during breeding season

Researchers from three Australian universities working on the southern Great Barrier Reef found that the snakes  particularly males  approached divers coiled around fins struck at camera reflections and made fast jerky movements during breeding season

The acts of aggression are likely because of mistaken identity during sexual interactions the scientists wrote in their new study  adding that the snakes it seems may believe divers are rivals or potential mates

And because large olive sea snakes have the capacity to bite human victims and pack a deadly venom the stakes for divers are very high

We are in an emergency Wildfires are raging across the world as scorching temperatures and dry conditions fuel the blazes that have cost lives and destroyed livelihoods

The combination of extreme heat changes in our ecosystem and prolonged drought have in many regions led to the worst fires in almost a decade and come after the IPCC handed down a damning landmark report on the climate crisis

But technically there are fewer wildfires than there have been in the past  the problem now though is that they are worse than ever before and we are running out of time to act as the Guardians global environment editor Jonathan Watts explains

Can you remember your last meal Because while lots of us can struggle cuttlefish dont seem to have a problem with these details

They have one of the largest brains among invertebrates and can remember what where and when specific things happened right up to their final days of life according to new research

The cephalopods  which have three hearts eight arms bluegreen blood regenerating limbs and the ability to camouflage and exert selfcontrol  only live for roughly two years

As they get older they show signs of declining muscle function and appetite but it appears that no matter their age they can remember what they ate where and when and use this to guide their future feeding decisions said the lead study author Dr Alexandra Schnell from the University of Cambridge

This is in contrast to humans who gradually lose the ability to remember experiences that occurred at a particular time and place with age  for instance what you ate for lunch last Wednesday This episodic memory and its deterioration is linked to the hippocampus a seahorseshaped organ in the part of the brain near our ears Cuttlefish meanwhile do not have a hippocampus but a vertical lobe associated with learning and memory

Today the Taliban is back in charge and ready to turn back the clock by imposing their draconian interpretation of religious law onto the country

And after almost 20 years the militant groups capture of Kabul happened in less than a week making its status as the longest conflict in US history even more headspinning

These self portraits tell the powerful story of marvelharriss gender reassignment surgery as well as confronting his struggles with autism and depression

In adolescence Harris a Dutch photographer experienced depression and gender dysphoria which provoked eating disorders and selfharm

In 2017 he embarked on gender transition and documented every stage of that process in a series of selfportraits which are painful to witness and profoundly affecting

Marvel now 26 started taking his selfportraits he says because he found it really difficult to express what was going on in my mind

Later when he shared the pictures with therapists and friends they encouraged him to put them online to help others who might recognise themselves in his images

Marvel a book of his pictures is the winner of this years Mack first book award This deeply personal book demands a more tolerant attitude from society towards transgender people and those who dont identify as entirely male or female

Harris says At first the focus of my project was my gender transition but along the way I found out that its about an ongoing search for myself

Its traumatising for my generation to see history repeating itself says Khalida Popal the former Afghanistan womens national team captain

After years of elevating the voices of female footballers in her country Popal is now urging players to delete their social media accounts erase their public identities and even burn their kits to remain safe in the wake of the Talibans seizure of power

Speaking to guardiansport she said For so long I have been fighting to bring visibility to women of Afghanistan and to encourage women of Afghanistan to use their voices Now Im telling them to silence that voice to not talk to not meet people to take everything down to remove their identities That is very painful

Claims that the Taliban have softened their approach are hugely concerning to Popal who had her right to an education taken away by the militant group in the 1990s saw her mothers right to work taken away and her father beaten for working with the government

Human Rights Watch has similarly urged caution and said that the Taliban should be judged on their track record not their current comments that they will allow women to work and participate in society

Now Popal and her former international teammates and coaching staff are calling for the sporting community to join them in being a voice for the voiceless women of Afghanistan

This is the reality on the ground in Afghanistan

A crying baby being handed over the perimeter wall of Kabuls airport  a member of the American army raising them over the barbed wire fencing We dont know what happened next  or if this family were able to escape together  but we do know it is yet another show of the desperate attempts being made to flee Taliban rule

With the militant group now in almost total control of Afghanistan  the Panjshir Valley the notable exception  and in charge of all of the countrys land borders the capitals airport is the only practicable way out of the country

The road to the airport  crowded chaotic and punctuated by regular gunfire  is the has proved impassable to many trying to reach military evacuation flights Despite Taliban assurances that those seeking to leave the country would be granted safe passage militant fighters blocked the gates to the airport letting few through and beating and shooting at some who tried to pass

Many Afghans fear that their past work with westerners makes them prime targets for retribution Prior to Afghanistan falling to Taliban control more than 300 Afghan interpreters and their relatives were killed by militants because of their US ties according to the nonprofit organisation No One Left Behind

The urgency of the evacuation of those allied with US and Nato forces and western media organisations was further compounded by growing reports of Taliban fighters going doortodoor looking for those who had worked with the previous regime and threatening them into joining the Taliban This manhunt was despite the group promising just days ago that they would seek no revenge

There is no accurate figure of the number of people  Americans Afghans or others  who are in need of evacuation as the process is almost entirely selfselecting It is estimated to be around 11000 to 15000 US citizens and dual USAfghan citizens along with family members as well as tens of thousands of Afghans who may also be at risk

These are the bestpreserved human remains ever discovered in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii

The remains of Marcus Venerius Secundio were found in a tomb at the necropolis of Porta Sarno The tomb is believed to date back to the decades before Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79

The discovery even includes Secundios white hair and a partially visible ear Initial tests show he died at about the age of 60

Secundio was a slave and the custodian of ancient Pompeiis Temple of Venus After being freed from slavery he rose though the social ranks and joined the Augustales a college of priests who were in charge of a form of emperor worship

An inscription dedicated to Secundio on a marble slab at the top of the tomb makes references to theatre performances in Pompeii that were conducted in Greek

The fact that he was buried in a tomb proves he succeeded in achieving a good social and economic position

Pompeii was very well preserved underneath the blanket of ash from the eruption and was discovered frozen in time in the 1700s Preserved remains of people sheltering from the eruption were found as well as bakeries with loaves still in the ovens

Ellie Cole has won six gold medals Yet as other women athletes or sportspeople of colour or other minorities can attest success is no shield sometimes

You know six years ago I was working at a place and I was told that I was a diversity hire she told guardianaustralia from a training camp in Cairns

The star swimmer believes the comment was made in jest But she was disappointed And I think thats when I really started asking myself questions about whats happening outside of the sporting space she says Because as a prolific athlete I do live in a bit of a bubble Whats actually happening out there in the real world needs to be spoken about more

Today the International Paralympic Committee  along with dozens of other major organisations  are launching WeThe15 which they hope to be the worlds largest human rights movement The 15 refers to the estimated 15 of people across the globe who have a disability

The goal of the 10year campaign which will be a key feature of the Paralympics Opening ceremony on 24 August is to act as a global movement publicly campaigning for disability visibility accessibility and inclusion Its main message is that people with disabilities dont need your pity they deserve your respect

When elliecoleswim was asked by the IPC to take part in the campaign she thought of her parents When they were told that I was going to have my leg amputated at three  their first response was that they felt this overwhelming sense of fear about what my future was going to be like Cole says They didnt know anyone else who had a disability

As a child Coles parents enrolled her in swimming to help with her rehabilitation This week at 29yearsold she will jet off to Tokyo for her fourth paralympics

Cole is the reigning champion in the 100m backstroke S9 and has 15 Paralympic medals to her name  six of them gold

Though neither of them can lay an egg  the duo have partnered up this nesting season at Melbourne aquarium

They are one of two samesex male gentoo penguin couples  along with
Tiger and Branston  to pair up

Lead bird keeper Tanith Davis said the aquarium often fostered eggs to malemale penguin partners and that samesex penguin pairs will court each other and incubate an egg exactly the same way as a malefemale pair

She added that samesex couples were not unusual in the animal kingdom Sea Life Melbourne has had many samesex couples in our breeding history and they have been doting parents

Gentoo penguins nest once a year just before the start of spring with both sexes sharing parenting duties and collecting rocks to build a comfortable home for their eggs

Samesex sexual behaviour has been observed in more than 1500 animal species according to a 2019 study published in peerreviewed online journal Nature Ecology and Evolution

Tributes have poured in for the comedian Sean Lock who has died of cancer at the age of 58

Celebrated for his carefully crafted surreal content and imaginative observational wit Lock was nominated for the Perrier comedy award at the Edinburgh fringe in 2000 for his show No Flatley I am the Lord of the Dance

He achieved television success with a long run as a team captain on Jimmy Carrs Channel 4 comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats and the spinoff 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown and also wrote and starred in the popular BBC sitcom 15 Storeys High The often deadpan absurdist whose timing was described by one writer as second only to the Greenwich Meridian toured extensively around the UK

Bill Bailey told the Guardian that Lock was as brilliantly funny off the stage as on and that their daft conversations would leave him helpless with laughter

His agent Off the Kerb Productions said Lock died at home surrounded by his family Sean was one of Britains finest comedians his boundless creativity lightning wit and the absurdist brilliance of his work marked him out as a unique voice in British comedy Sean was also a cherished husband and father to three children Sean will be sorely missed by all that knew him

Lee Mack a comedian and close friend also paid tribute to Lock I think the appeal of him as a viewer was that it felt like you were with your mate down the pub and he was making you laugh I was one of the lucky few that was that mate down the pub and he was making me laugh A lot More than almost anyone Ive ever known

There are thought to be 640 Afghans in this picture  all packed into a US military cargo plane desperately attempting to flee Kabul after the fall of the capital to the Taliban

The extraordinary image was obtained by US defence and security news site Defense One They reported that flight had not intended to take such a large load but some panicked Afghans pulled themselves on to the planes halfopen ramp

US defence officials said the passengers  among them women and children  on the flight were safely evacuated from Kabul to Qatar on Sunday

640 people are believed to have crammed into the C17 Globemaster III  among the highest number of people ever carried in such an aircraft The flight was one of several that was able to take off with hundreds on board and others may have carried even more passengers

The desperation of many other Afghans was seen at Kabul airport on Monday as people clung to the side of moving military planes and at least three apparently fell to their deaths from the undercarriage soon after takeoff Video footage showed hundreds of people running alongside a military carrier as it travelled along the runway

US forces shut down the airport on Monday in an effort to contain the chaos and crowds At least seven people were killed during the rush towards the sole remaining exit route out of the country

The airport  the only feasible route out after the Islamist group took control of the countrys land borders  reopened in the early hours of Tuesday a US general said adding that US personnel were now in charge of air traffic control

Joe Biden has said that US troops in Kabul would stay long enough to evacuate American citizens and eligible Afghan allies and warned the Taliban there would be a devastating response to any attempt to attack or disrupt the operation

Joe Biden is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the stunning fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban caught his administration flatfooted and raised fears of a humanitarian catastrophe

As the world saw images of desperate Afghans attempting to flee the country including people clinging to a US transport plane before takeoff a defiant Biden insisted he stands squarely behind his decision to pull US forces rapidly out of the country while attempting to shift blame for events unfolding there to his predecessor Donald Trump and the unwillingness of Afghan forces to fight the extremist insurgent force

Biden acknowledged that the scenes unfolding in Afghanistan are gutwrenching particularly for veterans and anyone who has spent time on the ground there But far from admitting error he claimed the events of the past few days vindicated his decision because US troops he said should not fight a war that Afghan solders are not willing to fight themselves

Biden had inherited a deal from Trump to withdraw forces by 1 May he added leaving him with a choice to either follow through belatedly on the agreement or escalate the conflict by sending thousands of troops into combat

The Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country ending two decades of a failed experiment to import westernstyle liberal democracy

At least seven people were killed amid the chaos at Kabul International Airport yesterday according to the AP

As Afghanistan falls to the Taliban a 24yearold woman in Kabul tells of seeing the fearful faces of women and ugly faces of men who hate women all around her

The anonymous university student wrote in the Guardian As a woman I feel like I am the victim of this political war that men started I felt like I can no longer laugh out loud I can no longer listen to my favourite songs I can no longer meet my friends in our favourite cafe I can no longer wear my favourite yellow dress or pink lipstick And I can no longer go to my job or finish the university degree that I worked for years to achieve

Afghan women fear that the freedoms won since 2001 will now be crushed I did not expect that we would be deprived of all our basic rights again and travel back to 20 years ago That after 20 years of fighting for our rights and freedom we should be hunting for burqas and hiding our identity she wrote

The final collapse of the 20year western mission to Afghanistan took only a single day as Taliban gunmen entered the capital Kabul on Sunday President Ashraf Ghani fled the country and America abandoned its embassy in panic

Thousands of Afghans mobbed the capitals airport desperate to escape Those with no option to leave had raced home when they realised the Taliban were arriving to destroy evidence of western or government links Women without burqas searched for shops where they could buy them Even hospitals were closed with at least one desperate woman forced to give birth at home with a doctor she begged to attend

In parks and other open areas people who had fled the Talibans advance in other parts of Afghanistan huddled in tents fearful of a future they had tried and failed to escape 

Even the Taliban themselves were surprised by the speed of the takeover cofounder Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar admitted in a video statement Now the group faces the challenge of ruling he added They are expected to proclaim a new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan soon

The United Nations refugee agency says more than 550000 people in Afghanistan have left their homes due to the conflict since the start of this year

Climate activist Greta Thunberg has used an interview with a top style and culture magazine to call out fast fashion companies for greenwashing

In an Instagram post to accompany her appearance on the cover of the first issue of Vogue Scandinavia the 18yearold spoke out about the contradiction between mass produced fashion and sustainability

Many are making it look as if the fashion industry are starting to take responsibility by spending fantasy amounts on campaigns where they portray themselves as sustainable ethical green climate neutral and fair Thunberg wrote But lets be clear This is almost never anything but pure greenwashing

She also called out the fast fashion industry for being a huge contributor to the climate emergency as well as its impact on exploited workers and communities around the world

Her interview with Vogue Scandinavia was published after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes damning report on Monday which showed a critical global heating threshold of 15C may be breached far earlier than previously expected potentially within a decade

The rent is too damn high

A twobedroom rental  a reasonable size for a family  would stretch the budgets of renters in most US counties new data has revealed

As the map above shows the percentage of income the average renter needs to spend on a twobed is very rarely affordable just look at how few green counties there are

Shocked Well theres more the data also reveals that nearly half of American workers dont earn enough to afford a onebedroom rental

Rents in the US continued to increase through the pandemic and a worker now needs to earn about 2040 an hour to afford a modest onebedroom rental The median wage in the US is about 21 an hour

The data from the National Low Income Housing Coalition nlihc shows that millions of Americans  from Amazon warehouse workers to cab drivers to public school teachers  are struggling to pay rent For the poorest Americans marketrate housing is out of reach in virtually all of the country

About 14 of Americans fell behind on rent payments during the pandemic  roughly double the figure before the pandemic A federal moratorium on evictions has kept renters from being kicked out of their homes but the moratorium lapsed last month only to be extended into early October for those in regions hardest hit by the pandemic

Hands masked in thick black oil this fisher drips toxic globules back into the sea as he pleads with the camera urging viewers to share this video

In the footage filmed onboard a small boat activist Gary Aboud documents an oil spill this week in the Gulf of Paria off the Caribbean coast of Trinidad

It is just the latest of many spills that threaten to wreak havoc on the areas vulnerable marine life and fishing industry

Aboud who heads a local environmental watchdog showed the extent of the spill which he said stretched for miles and criticised what he said was a halfhearted cleanup attempt by oil company Paria Fuel Trading Company Limited

Fishermen and Friends of the Sea FFOS went out to document the spill and filmed a vessel at full throttle apparently attempting to break up the oil layer Breaking up the large globs into smaller globs might be less offensive to the eye but its equally offensive to us When you break the oil up it sinks and goes to the ocean bed where it will continue to degrade and get into the food chain said Aboud

Paria said it discovered this spill on Saturday and that a leak along a 12inch crude pipeline was the cause In a statement released on Monday it said The spill is contained and a residual cleanup is ongoing

Oil that sinks to the seabed forces fish to migrate and can reach the food chain A 2019 study showed unsafe levels of carcinogens in fish caught in the area

The regions oil industry has come under increasing fire as the Gulf of Paria has been plagued by spills over the past few years

Paria Fuel Trading Company Limited has not responded to requests for comment

We havent seen so much rain in 20 or 30 years

Those words of one resident in a heavily flooded area in Chinas Hubei province where at least 21 people are known to have died

The image above  taken on Thursday  shows a child who looks terrified being evacuated by rescuers following the torrential rains which caused power cuts and landslides Footage has captured families wading in water that had risen to above hip level while carrying their essentials in plastic bags Emergency services have also carried people to safety on bulldozers

Hundreds of homes have been destroyed and nearly 6000 people were forced to evacuate the provinces Emergency Management Bureau said on Friday as reservoirs reach dangerous levels

It comes weeks after record floods wreaked havoc and killed hundreds in a neighbouring province

China has been battered by unprecedented rains in recent months extreme weather that experts say is increasingly common due to global heating

The countrys meteorological administration warned that heavy rainfall was likely to continue until next week with regions along the Yangtze River including Shanghai vulnerable to flooding

Is there anything more joyous than baby elephants

These photos are from Kenyas first Indigenously owned and run sanctuary for orphaned elephants

Established in 2016 the Reteti sanctuary rescues and rehabilitates young orphan elephants who arrived as a result of humanelephant conflict droughtrelated issues and in one rare case poaching

They are nursed back to health then sent back to the wild

It is the beginning of a transformation in the way the Samburu people relate to wild animals

This oasis isnt just about saving elephants but about breaking down stereotypes and redefining wildlife management

The sanctuary is empowering Samburu women such as Sasha L Dorothy to be the first female elephant keepers in Africa Before I was afraid of wild animals especially elephants but now I see them differently she says

Since September 2016 the team at Reteti has rescued more than 35 elephants and returned 10 to the wild

CocaCola bottles and cans were the most prevalent branded litter on beaches in the UK a report has found  with campaigners calling on the government to get on with introducing a deposit return scheme for packaging

Almost twothirds 65 of all branded packaging pollution across the nations coastline can be traced back to just 12 companies according to the findings by the marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage SAS

These are CocaCola PepsiCo AB InBev McDonalds Mondelz International Heineken Tesco Carlsberg Group Suntory Haribo Mars and Aldi

In total 3913 volunteers collected branded items over 11139 miles making it the UKs biggest coordinated cleanup event SAS recorded a total of 9998 branded items that were linked to 328 companies

A spokesperson for CocaCola said Like everyone we care about reducing packaging waste and we dont want to see any of our packaging end up where it shouldnt  Its disappointing to see any packaging being littered and thats why we support the introduction of a welldesigned deposit return scheme which would encourage people to recycle rather than litter or throw away

Many companies say that a lack of a good deposit return scheme DRS in the UK means the packaging of their products gets needlessly littered

There are plans for such a scheme in Britain but this has been delayed until 2024  with the government blaming the Covid19 pandemic

In a DRS consumers are charged an additional deposit fee when they buy a drink in a singleuse container This deposit acts as an incentive to support recycling because it is redeemed when the consumer returns the empty container to a return point

Do you support the idea of deposit return schemes

The UK government have opened the door to expanding the use of animal testing to ingredients used in cosmetic products for the first time in 23 years an animal welfare charity has said

Cruelty Free International CFI said animal testing on ingredients exclusively used in cosmetics  which was banned in the UK in 1998  could be required after being told by the Home Office that the government had reconsidered its policy

In a letter the government said it was aligning itself with a decision made last year by the appeals board of the European Chemicals Agency ECHA which said that some ingredients used only in cosmetics needed to be tested on animals to ensure they were safe

The Home Office insisted that UK law on animal testing had not changed but campaigners warned that accepting the ECHAs ruling could lead to a much wider use of animal testing

The ECHA ruled that German chemicals firm Symrise had to carry out animal tests on two ingredients used solely in cosmetics to satisfy chemicals regulations overruling EU restrictions on animal testing of cosmetic ingredients The ingredients are widely used across a range of cosmetics

In a letter sent to CFI and seen by the Guardian the Home Office said it aimed to publicly clarify its position now with the formal publication of an updated policy and regulatory guidance

CFIs director of science and regulatory affairs Dr Katy Taylor told our science correspondent Natalie Grover This decision blows a hole in the UKs longstanding leadership of no animal testing for cosmetics and makes a mockery of the countrys quest to be at the cutting edge of research and innovation relying once again on cruel and unjustifiable tests that date back over half a century

In response a government spokesperson said there had been no change in legislation and that the ban on using animals for the testing of finished cosmetic products remained in force

A 2020 survey from UK charity Frame found that 84 of respondents would not buy a cosmetics product if they knew it or one of its ingredients had been tested on animals

New York governor Andrew Cuomo has resigned following an investigation by the state attorney general that found he sexually harassed multiple women most of whom worked for him and also retaliated after some made complaints

The Democratic governor had lost the support of the party establishment with Joe Biden calling on Cuomo to resign following a damning report by the New York attorney general last week 

Cuomos own No 2 the New York lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul had called his conduct repulsive and unlawful

Cuomo had initially stood defiant on the day the New York attorney general Letitia James had announced the findings of a fivemonth investigation in which she concluded he had harassed 11 women and violated civil law against workplace misconduct

The 63yearold governor issued a video address shortly after James issued the report of the investigation on Tuesday 3 August in which he said I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances and added Its just not who I am

But his political future was dangling by a thread amid moves to impeach and force him from office by the New York legislative assembly

At a stable in rural New York traumatized soldiers and horses are teaching each other to leave the past behind

The photograph above is of Phil Wytrwa a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and wild mustang Tango at the EquiCenter a therapeutic equestrian facility

There under the supervision of a horse trainer Wytrwa is one of 16 veterans who have sought reprieve from posttraumatic stress among one of the most unpredictable animals wild mustangs

The stable runs a program that matches veterans with mustangs to train in hopes the animals can be adopted or utilized as therapeutic partners Training the horses serves as a kind of therapy helping veterans rebuild their own confidence focus and sense of purpose

Wytrwa described a life transformed by this work When he returned from Afghanistan symptoms of PTSD hounded his daily life flashbacks made it impossible to work and his depression was incapacitating

It has helped me immensely he said By focusing on taking care of the animals he says he was able to become better at taking care of himself Over time he became more patient more present with his fiance and children Its the horses  they did this They did all of it Wytrwa added

Luann Van Peursem who received the Air Force commendation medal for saving two men during a rocket attack in Iraq is pictured on slide five She first started coming for riding lessons in 2014 when nightmares flashbacks and depression were consuming her life Coming back from Iraq you just dont have a lot of trust in mankind and you just kind of isolate she said

Working with a frightened animal forces the veterans nervous behavior to shift in the opposite direction Confidence and calm are necessary to put the horse at ease That connection lets your anxiety relax  because the horses feed off of you If youre tight theyre going to be tight Van Peursem said Her work with the horses has been so helpful that she went so far as to say I wouldnt be alive without it

This is Kiritimati or Christmas Island  a coral atoll  which is part of Kiribati a remote and lowlying nation in the Pacific Ocean

Experts have warned places like this could be lost entirely due to the climate crisis Theyve said global heating above 15C will be catastrophic for Pacific island nations and within the century we may see the loss of entire countries due to sea level rise

Significant parts of places like Kiribati as well as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands could become uninhabitable if greenhouse gas emissions arent halved to limit heating to 15C above preindustrial levels as outlined in yesterdays IPCC landmark report on the climate crisis

The Pacific has long suffered from king tides catastrophic cyclones increasing salinity in water tables making growing crops impossible sustained droughts and the loss of lowlying islands to sea level rise These crises are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the world heats

Satyendra Prasad Fijis ambassador and permanent representative to United Nations admitted the IPCC report is very alarming but added that the impact of global heating had been felt across the Pacific for years

Joseph Sikulu Pacific managing director of climate activist group 350org also described the IPCC report as sobering  but not unexpected He points out that the recent devastating realworld examples of the climate crisis playing out around the world wildfires in the US heatwaves in Canada fires in Siberia Turkey and Greece floods in China are things that the Pacific has been warning about for years

What can you do if you cant hug the newest member of your family

New parents in Japan have one interim solution  they have been sending bags of rice that weigh the same as their newborn babies to relatives who are unable to visit them due to the coronavirus pandemic

The bags come in a wide range of designs with some shaped like a baby wrapped in a blanket so that loved ones can feel as though they are hugging the new arrival while looking at a picture of their face which is attached to the front

The price of the bag increases in parallel with the size of the baby some firms charge one yen a gram with a 35kg pack priced 3500 yen 2290

Naruo Ono the owner of Kome no Zoto Yoshimiya rice shop says they first had the idea about 14 years ago when their own son was born I was thinking about what I could do for relatives who lived far away and couldnt come and see him So we decided to make bags of rice that were the same weight and shape as the baby so relatives could hold them and feel the cuteness

Ono has since expanded the product range to include weddingthemed celebration rice bags The wedding rice bags have ended up becoming even more popular than the birth ones

During the pandemic the demand for them has really increased as people havent been able to travel to wedding ceremonies added Ono

Would you do this for a birth or wedding announcement in your family

Karel August Pekelharing was a gay artist who when World War II broke out joined the Dutch resistance and worked to sabotage the Nazi persecution of the Jews by forging ID papers and helping them to hide

In March 1944 he took part in a daring raid on the Weteringschans prison with the aim of freeing resistance fighters The attack failed A week later he was arrested and tortured In June 1944 he and six fellow fighters were executed

He has now been honoured in Amsterdam with a Stolpersteine or stumbling stone  a brass memorial plaques embedded in the street that call on passersby to remember individual victims of the Nazi genocide and oppression a mental stumbling that forces pedestrians to reckon with the past

The Netherlands has about 8500 Stolpersteine but this is the first of four in the country to commemorate Jews and resistance fighters who were known to be gay Another of the stones remembers Mina Sluijter a seamstress who was arrested in July 1942 as the deportation of Dutch Jews was starting Her police file states she was in detention for homosexuality  also Jewish She was murdered at the Auschwitz concentration camp two months later

Local activists believe gay victims of Nazi persecution have been overlooked We thought it was very sad that these people who often didnt have any children or partners or relatives who could request a Stolperstein for them just disappeared We wanted to give them a name said Philip Tijsma a spokesman for COC Netherlands the LGBTQ rights group founded in 1946 by former resistance workers

Seeing the first four Stolpersteine laid was quite an emotional moment Tijsma said Because you are standing in front of the houses were they lived until just the day before they were either transported to Auschwitz or Sobibor to be destroyed or were shot  Thats the thing about the Stolperstein it brings history very close it makes it almost tangible this is where they walked on this very sidewalk

This is Geronimo and right now hes probably the worlds most famous alpaca Heres why the sixyear old animal is facing a death sentence after twice testing positive for bovine tuberculosis bTB a deadly respiratory disease that has blighted the countryside for decades

The row over his fate has captured the publics imagination  with a petition to save him gathering nearly 100000 signatures celebrity backing and his friendly furry face splashing British newspaper front pages But vets have cautioned that the law is clear Geronimo the alpaca must be put down

Owner Helen Macdonald a veterinary nurse who runs an alpaca farm in Gloucestershire first brought Geronimo to the UK from New Zealand four years ago when he tested positive on arrival Since then she says she has spent 80000 exhausting legal avenues trying to save him

Despite the campaigning the environment secretary George Eustice has wrote that culling animals for bTB was an arduous but necessary endeavour and that Geronimos positive tests which Macdonald disputes are a very strong indicator of the presence of the disease

Vets have said being an alpaca does not give Geronimo an exemption from rules that apply to all animals

Sarah Tomlinson a farm vet and bTB expert who sits on Defras Bovine TB Partnership said Ultimately it is a notifiable disease and we have quite specific laws around notifiable diseases because they have either impacts on animal health and welfare impacts on international trade  so if we have it we cant trade  and also for public health reasons

Notifiable diseases are usually highly contagious infections that can spread to humans especially when animals are in regular close contact with people Macdonald has vowed to stand in the way of any gunman who comes to destroy Geronimo and insists that he poses no risk to other animals or humans

It is unequivocal

Those three words are the first in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes new report  their starkest warning yet on global heating

It has laid out how the climate crisis is unequivocally caused by human activities and is unequivocally affecting every corner of the planets land air and sea already

The report produced by hundreds of the worlds top scientists and signed off by all the worlds governments says within the next two decades temperatures are likely to rise by more than 15C above preindustrial levels bringing widespread devastation and extreme weather

The collapse of major Atlantic currents ice caps or the Amazon rainforest cannot be ruled out the report warns

Antnio Guterres the UN secretarygeneral warned This report is a code red for humanity The alarm bells are deafening and the evidence is irrefutable greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk

But the report is clear that there are no cliffedges to the climate crisis Each tonne of carbon pumped out increases the impacts and risks of extreme heat floods and droughts and so every tonne of carbon matters It will never be too late to act the report shows Instead the real question is how bad will it get

Spain may be famous for its love of meat  but groups of vegan activists are now dedicating themselves to rescuing animals  creating a place where they can live without being put to work or slaughtered

There are around 20 animal sanctuaries in the country where employees and volunteers are connected via WhatsApp  sharing veterinary information and coordinating animal rescues for cows bulls pigs sheep and geese

Rather than being killed for meat or shackled for dairy production these animals are fed and exercised given medicine if theyre sick rehabilitated if theyre injured and the main privilege denied to most farm animals allowed to live long lives

After spending time at two of these sanctuaries photographer anapalaciosphoto said It was the profound bond between animals and humans that really struck me adding that she hasnt eaten meat since

This is the photo that has come to define the Turkey wildfires

The image of a little boy ready for a swim his gaze distracted by a firefighting plane in smokefilled skies has for many come to symbolise the destruction wreaked by Turkeys wildfires over the past nine days

Taken apparently by a Russian holidaymaker in Antalya last week the photograph has been shared widely by Turkish social media users many of whom are reeling from the unprecedented wildfires which experts say have been caused by the climate crisis and incompetent management from Ankaras forestry department

More than 180 fires have killed at least eight people devastated vast swathes of pine forest and agricultural land

The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoan faces a rising tide of anger from the Turkish public over his governments slow and lacklustre response to the disaster

Does this stat change your mind about bottled tap water

Scientists in Barcelona have found the impact of bottled water on natural resources is 3500 times higher than for tap water

The research is the first of its kind and examined the impact of bottled water in the Spanish city where it is becoming increasingly popular despite improvements to the quality of tap water in recent years

Research led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health ISGlobal found that if the citys population were all to drink bottled water this would result in a 3500 times higher cost of resource extraction than if they all drank tap water at 839m 603m a year

Researchers also found the impact of bottled water on ecosystems is 1400 times higher than tap water

The lead author of the study Cristina Villanueva said Health reasons dont justify the wide use of bottled water Yes strictly speaking drinking tap water is worse for local health but when you weigh both what you gain from drinking bottled water is minimal Its quite obvious that the environmental impacts of bottled water are higher compared to tap water

In the US 17m barrels of oil are needed to produce the plastic to meet annual bottled water demand Villanueva said people trusted bottled water because advertisers have done a good job of convincing people So we need the effort on the other side

Were waging a battle of the titans deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias told journalists The hardest is still to come

On the island some 200km 125 miles away from the capital Athens the huge flames leaping up from the forest could be seen from the sea

In the image above one man was photographed spraying water on a burning olive press factory in the village of Rovies

Firefighters said it was a difficult blaze to control on an island of rolling hills with little visibility but that everyone had been evacuated from nearby villages except three monks from Saint David Monastery who had refused to leave

Were suffocating due to the smoke one of the monks told the ANA news agency by phone describing flames 30 to 40 metres 100 to 130 feet high surrounding the monastery Police told AFP they would force the monks to evacuate if their lives were in danger

Firefighters were also continuing to battle a blaze near Athens on Thursday morning while the mayor of Olympia the birthplace of the Olympic Games pleaded for help as flames threatened the site

According to Hardalias Greece has faced a total of 118 fires in the last 24 hours as temperatures soared above 40C 104F

Authorities have described the heatwave as the worst in the country since 1987

Experts have warned that global heating is increasing both the frequency and intensity of such fires

Though the Tuatara is slowmoving the ancient reptiles have surprised researchers  why you ask With their fastmoving sperm

The discovery came amid a new effort by scientists to gather and preserve the sperm of the protected atrisk species to try to ensure it survives new threats and a warming planet

Tuatara unique to New Zealand sometimes take 16 months to hatch and 35 years to reach full size of about 05m

They can then live and reproduce until they are more than 100 years old  in 2008 Henry the Tuatara became a firsttime father at the age of 111

But researchers said they were shocked to discover that tuatara sperm are the fastest swimmers of any reptile studied to date

They think the speed could be because unlike most other reptiles Tuatara dont have penises so their sperm swim four times faster than other reptiles to aid delivery They reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his cloaca or genital orifice over hers

Today their existence is being threatened further by global heating Thats because their sex is determined by the temperature Tuatara eggs are exposed to  warmer temperatures mean more males hatch

As the planet warms scientists warn that more and more male hatchlings will be produced skewing sex ratios If populations are too maledominated they will become functionally extinct

Now New Zealand researchers are engaged in a new effort to create an insurance policy of frozen sperm that they could use to replenish populations

On 4 August 2020 one of the largest nonnuclear blasts in history destroyed much of Beiruts port area killing at least 210 people and injuring more than 6000 others

One year on the Lebanese capital remains a shell of a city while most of the physical damage has been repaired the scar on Beiruts psyche remains raw and festering its impact intensified by the anger of a people denied justice

The explosion is believed to have been caused by an estimated 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse The investigation into the blast has flatlined and its perpetrators are as far away from accountability as ever

Even worse the global aid pledged in the wake of the destruction remains forsaken by Lebanons rulers who prefer the narrow privileges that flowed to them from a crippled system to a global rescue plan that could save the country

In a rarely seen phenomenon in the monkey world a nineyearold female known as Yakei has become the boss of a 677strong troop of Japanese macaques at a nature reserve on the island of Kyushu in Japan

Yakeis path to the top began in April when she beat up her own mother to become the alpha female of the troop at the Takasakiyama natural zoological garden in Oita city

While that would have been the pinnacle for most female monkeys Yakei decided to throw her 10kg weight around among the males In late June she challenged and roughed up Sanchu the 31yearold alpha male who had been leader of troop B at the reserve for five years

Surprised wardens at Takasakiyama where there has never been a female monkey boss in the reserves 70year history carried out a peanut test on 30 June putting out nuts for the group and seeing who ate first Sanchu backed away and gave Yakei first dibs on the treat confirming her alpha status

Since then Yakei has been climbing trees and shaking them which is an expression of power and a very rare behaviour in females Satoshi Kimoto a guide at Takasakiyama told the Guardian

Takasakiyama established as a reserve for monkeys in 1952 is home to about 1500 macaques split between troop A and troop B The monkeys live mainly in the forested mountain at the centre of the reserve roaming freely and coming down to lower ground for food provided by wardens

The wild population of Japanese macaque monkeys is estimated to be more than 100000 They are known to sometimes be aggressive and hikers mountain climbers and visitors to the Takasakiyama reserve are advised not to maintain eye contact with them as it is interpreted as a challenge

Simone Biles the greatest gymnast of all time ended her Olympics with a bronze medal  but after a week in Tokyo it felt like a victory

The fourtime Olympic champion pulled out of the team final due to mental health concerns then also withdrew from the allaround floor and uneven bars but her bronze in the beam today tied her with Shannon Miller for the most by a US gymnast at the Olympics on seven

It wasnt easy pulling out of all those competitions Biles said after clinching bronze People just thought it was easy but I physically and mentally was not in the right head space and I didnt want to jeopardize my health and my safety because at the end of the day its not worth it

Biles added that she is grateful to have had the opportunity to bring the topic of mental health to the fore

I think it should be talked about a lot more especially with athletes because I know some of us are going through the same things and were always told to push through it she said But were all a little bit older now and we can kind of speak for ourselves At the end of the day were not just entertainment were humans and there are things going on behind the scenes that were also trying to juggle with as well on top of sports

New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard made history on Monday night  becoming the first openly transgender woman to compete in the Olympics

In a rare interview with international media after her appearance in the over87kg final which had been the subject of controversy and scrutiny Hubbard said We are human and as such I hope that just being here is enough

I dont think it should be historic I think as we move into a new and more understanding world people are starting to realise that people like me are just people

Hubbard 43 failed with attempts to lift 120kg and two at 125kg in the snatch as she made a quick exit from the competition Chinas Li lifted an Olympic record of 320kg to take the gold medal with Britains Emily Campbell claiming silver and American Sarah Robles winning bronze

After the event Hubbard said she planned to retire from the sport adding that she had never sought publicity nor regards herself a role model or trailblazer but just wants to be treated like any other athlete on sports biggest stage

Young marine turtles are swallowing large quantities of plastic with ocean pollution changing habitats that were once ideal for their development into a risk researchers have found

The animals evolved overtime to develop in the open ocean  areas of the ocean away from the coast and above the seabed  because predators are relatively scarce But now plastic is now polluting these habitats that were once ideal for their development

A new study into plastic pollution and young turtles has called this an evolutionary trap

Writing in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science researchers in the UK and Australia reported how they looked for the presence of plastic in the innards of 121 sea turtles of five species  green loggerhead olive ridley hawksbill and flatback The turtles were from the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia and the Pacific Ocean off the east coast of Australia and were either stranded or caught unintentionally

The impact of plastic on wildlife is a growing area of study and researchers have revealed harrowing cases of marine animals sustaining injuries or dying after ingesting such material or becoming entangled in it

One study estimated that between 48m and 127m tonnes of plastic entered the worlds oceans in 2010 alone while a recent review by the Australian governments science agency CSIRO found that animals across 80 different species including turtles were being killed by ingesting plastic

Krystsina Tsimanouskaya an Olympic sprinter from Belarus has received a humanitarian visa from Poland upon seeking asylum It comes after she allegedly refused an order to fly home early from Japan for criticising her coaches

Her husband Arseniy Zdanevich fled Belarus for Ukraine telling Sky News I didnt think it would get this serious I made the decision to leave without thinking twice

Over the weekend Tsimanouskaya was abruptly removed from competition and spirited to the airport by team officials but she refused to board the flight back to Minsk and sought police protection

The 24yearold posted a video about the negligence of her coaches for entering her into the 400m relay at short notice as her teammates hadnt had the correct doping tests

Belarusian state media criticised her for lacking team spirit

The incident on Sunday highlighted discord in Belarus a former Soviet state that is run with a tight grip by president Alexander Lukashenko In power since 1994 he faced a wave of mass street protests last year over what his opponents called rigged elections which some athletes joined

The American athlete has suffered from mental health problems and paid tribute to her communities after her silver medal on Sunday She added that younger people were more open to differences than previous generations

I really think that my generation really dont care Saunders said At the end of the day we really dont care Shout out to all my black people Shout out to all my LGBTQ community Shout out to all my people dealing with mental health At the end of the day we understand its bigger than us and its bigger than the powers that be We understand that theres so many people that are looking up to us that are looking to see if we say something or if we speak up for them

Like many other athletes at Tokyo 2020 most notably gymnast Simone Biles Saunders said she has sometimes struggled with the pressures of elite sport  adding that she had been helped by reaching out to her former therapist

Four dogs one mission to sniffsearch for mines left by the Islamic State in northern Iraq

Branco an eightyearold Belgian shephard is part of the elite team of canines detecting the underground explosives so that a mineclearing team can get rid of them

ISIS produced thousands of these mines when the terror group held sway over this part of Iraq and commandeered plastics factories in their Mosul base

A single mine known as VS50 could fit on the palm of your hand and contains about 100g of explosives The pressure pad is sensitive enough for a child to activate even through 30cm of packed earth The explosion can take out an armoured vehicle

Branco is trained to sniff ahead in a controlled manner and stop if he gets a scent  so he doesnt tread on the mine

Belgian and German shepherds are used because they are most adept at distinguishing scents

This is Karapiru Aw Guaj A man who has lived an extraordinary life and inspired so many along the way

He survived a massacre that killed most of his family in the Brazilian Amazon and lived for 10 years alone in the forest but Karapiru could not escape the pandemic

One of the last of the huntergatherer nomadic Aw of Maranho state he died of Covid19 earlier this month With only 300 Aw thought to remain they have been called the earths most threatened tribe

Survival International a group working for the rights of indigenous people describes Karapirus extraordinary warmth and kindness

Aw lands have been under attack since the discovery of iron ore in the late 1960s The scale of the mining development gouged from the Amazon is such that it can be seen from space

In the 1970s Karapiru lost almost everyone he knew in a genocidal attack on his tribe by settlers

After the massacre Karapiru spent 10 years alone eating honey small birds and sleeping in the boughs of copaiba trees and among the orchids

Marina Magalhes a linguist studying the Aw language who became friends with Karapiru in 2001 said

Karapiru in my view represents the best that a human being can become due to his friendliness and tranquility Also an example of how resilient we can be in the most extreme situations

Refugees from seven generations have come together to recreate a photograph of the signing of the UN refugee convention to mark the agreements 70th anniversary

The gathering celebrates decades of the UK granting sanctuary to people fleeing for their lives  but also warns that the nations duty towards refugees must continue into the future

The photo created by coalition campaign Together With Refugees brings together refugees from a range of conflicts including the Hungarian uprising Ugandan Asians who fled Idi Amins regime and the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans war In the place of the UN document they signed an orange heart a symbol of support for refugees

The UN refugee convention 1951 formalised the rights of refugees under international law It means that countries signed up to it have a legal duty to protect those fleeing persecution and serious harm in other countries A total of 149 countries have signed up to this law including the UK

George Szirtes 72 who took part in the recreation photograph is a successful writer who arrived in the UK as a refugee in 1956 at eight years old having fled from Hungary

He said Giving safety to people fleeing war and persecution was necessary 70 years ago and I suspect it is more necessary now than ever before

Enver Solomon a spokesperson for Together With Refugees and CEO of the Refugee Council said Seventy years ago after the horrors of the second world war the UK signed the Refugee convention We gave our commitment to protect people fleeing war and persecution Since then it has saved hundreds of thousands of lives These are people who have gone on to make huge contributions to our communities as proud Britons And we must continue to safeguard this promise of safety

Armed with a taxidermied wolf to lure poachers Rod Coronado hunts down hunters in Wisconsin

He doesnt use violent tactics however  he gave those up long ago Instead he shoots hunters with something much more effective his camera

As the founder of Wolf Patrol Coronado recently captured footage from one of Wisconsins worst wolf massacres In less than three days 216 wolves were killed by hunters using tracking dogs

The mass killing came after the state handed out 1548 hunting permits despite there only being an estimated 1000 wolves in Wisconsin It was also the first hunt since the gray wolf was removed from the endangered species list by the Trump administration last fall

While wolf hunting is legal in Wyoming Montana and Idaho Wisconsin is the only state that allows the controversial use of tracking dogs  a practice that Wolf Patrol which has made a habit of following Wisconsin houndsmen through the woods for years hoped to call attention to by posting their footage of the hunt on YouTube

Its not a sport Coronado says Its just killing

This lake is not supposed to be pink Its not a wonder of nature  its caused by pollution

In the Chubut province of Argentina the dumping of toxic waste from fishing has tinted the lagoon

Experts and activists blame it on pollution by a chemical used to preserve prawns for export

The colour is caused by sodium sulfite an antibacterial product used in fish factories

The lagoon which is not used for recreation receives runoff from the Trelew industrial park and has turned the colour of fuchsia before

Residents in the local area have complained about the foul smells and pollution concerns around the Chibut river which feeds into the Corfo lagoon In protest against the continued pollution locals have blocked roads used by fish waste trucks from entering the area

The reddish colour does not cause damage and will disappear in a few days environmental control chief for Chubut province Juan Micheloud told AFP last week

After the USAs win against Iran a mutual feeling of respect and fellowship emerged yesterday

Sean Ingle The Guardians chief sports reporter is in Tokyo right now  heres a snippet of his analysis from last nights basketball match

The players and coaches gave their political leaders a lesson in harmony decency and class in Tokyo

Seeing players from these teams bond during and after their match was enough to melt the heart of even the iciest cynic

When US coach Gregg Popovich was asked about the significance of his team and Iran sharing a court together he hit the nail on the head I think people from different countries get along better than their governments he said People appreciate each other no matter what country you are talking about I really believe that And this is a time where sport transcends all that petty crap you get from governments

Whether this will make any difference to wider USIran relations is an entirely different story But it might at least make leaders stop to reflect

Police officers have described fearing for their lives during the January attack on the US Capitol and living with constant trauma during the first hearing of the House investigation into the deadly assault with prominent Republicans boycotting proceedings in an attempt to undermine any findings

In harrowing testimony on Tuesday the officers described being crushed by violent proTrump rioters threatened with their own service weapons and being targeted with racist abuse

The special committee established by the Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi convened to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 6 January insurrection

Representative Bennie Thompson said if the committee he chairs can prevent any future attacks on the Capitol that would be the most valuable contribution to this great democracy

We must know what happened here at the Capitol Congresswoman Liz Cheney a Trump critic and one of just two Republicans on the select committee said in opening remarks

We must also know what happened every minute of that day in the White House  every phone call every conversation every meeting leading up to during and after the attack Honorable men and women have an obligation to step forward

Imagine being out of sight of land running out of fuel coming across incredibly busy shipping lanes when youre frightened and you dont know which direction youre going in That is by anyones standards distress Our role in this is incredible important simply to respond to a need to save lives said Mark Dowie the chief executive of the UKs Royal National Lifeboat Institution RNLI

The RNLI has hit out at accusations it is operating a migrant taxi service by rescuing people at risk of dying in the water as they cross the English Channel in small boats which the charity says is its moral and legal duty

While the charity does not take a stance on political matters Dowie said These islands have the reputation for doing the right thing and being decent societies and we should be very proud of the work were doing to bring these people home safe

I understand its a polarising and complex situation he said But unless youve experienced being in an open boat in the waves its quite hard to get a feel for what it must be like

RNLI crew members are mostly volunteers and wake up in the middle of the night or leave their regular jobs to rescue people in distress in the sea Once they return with migrants they ensure they are safe and well before handing them over to the police and border control officers

Volunteers shared experiences of vile abuse on the beach as they returned with people including young children in desperate need of medical attention such as having beer cans thrown at them and people shouting fuck off back to France

The Queens lawyers secretly lobbied Scottish ministers to change a draft law to exempt her private land from a major initiative to cut carbon emissions documents reveal

The exemption means the Queen one of the largest landowners in Scotland is the only person in the country not required to facilitate the construction of pipelines to heat buildings using renewable energy

Her lawyers secured the dispensation from Scotlands government five months ago by exploiting an obscure parliamentary procedure known as Queens consent which gives the monarch advance sight of legislation

In a series of reports into Queens consent in recent months the Guardian revealed how the Queen repeatedly used her privileged access to draft laws to lobby ministers to change UK legislation to benefit her private interests or reflect her opinions between the late 1960s and the 1980s

The new documents uncovered by Lily Humphreys a researcher for the Scottish Liberal Democrats using freedom of information laws disclose how the monarch used her special access to Scottish legislation to intervene in the parliamentary process as recently as February

The documents also suggest Nicola Sturgeons government failed to disclose the monarchs lobbying this year when a Scottish politician used a parliamentary debate to query why the Queen was securing an exemption from the green energy bill

The move appears at odds with the royal familys public commitment to tackling the climate crisis with Prince William recently joining his father Charles in campaigning to cut emissions and protect the planet

There is more to life than just gymnastics

The American gymnast Simone Biles the biggest star at the Tokyo Olympics and the greatest athlete in the sports history has withdrawn from the womens allaround gymnastics final

The news followed her dramatic decision to stop competing in the womens team event on Tuesday after one rotation on the vault citing mental health concerns

After withdrawing from the event Biles admitted that she had struggled with the demands of being one of the most famous athletes in the world the unique pressure of these Games and the added challenge of being stuck in a Covid secure bubble

I say put mental health first because if you dont then you arent going to enjoy your sport and you arent going to succeed as much as you want to

So its OK sometimes to even sit out the big competitions to focus on yourself because it shows how strong of a competitor and person you really are

Her decision has been widely praised by Americas sporting superstars with Michael Phelps the most decorated Olympian in history among those insisting that it would blow the doors open over athletes mental health I hope this is an opportunity for us to jump on board and to even blow this mental health thing even more wide open It is so much bigger than we can ever imagine

A doctor in Alabama has revealed the heartbreaking pleas of her Covid patients to be vaccinated as their conditions worsened

Its a sad reminder of what the US government is calling the pandemic of the unvaccinated which is playing out in painful ways as some realize too late that they wish theyd had the shot while others hold out even as they suffer in hospital

At least 99 of those in the US who died of coronavirus in the last six months had not been vaccinated according to the CDC

Meanwhile vaccination rates have slowed down nationwide and are especially low in some of the more conservative southern parts of the country despite more than 610000 people in the US dying of the virus since the pandemic hit in early 2020

In places such as Alabama only 33 of people who can receive the vaccine had been fully vaccinated as of 20 July Officials recently reported 96 of Alabamians who have died of Covid since April were not fully vaccinated

Among the people succumbing to the deadly disease are those who are increasingly catching the Delta variant of the coronavirus which is far more contagious than the original According to the CDC Delta is now the dominant strain in the US making up 83 of new cases

I feel incredibly proud to say that I am a gay man and also an Olympic champion When I was younger I didnt think Id ever achieve anything because of who I was To be an Olympic champion now just shows that you can achieve anything Tom Daley said after winning Olympic gold with his diving partner Matty Lee for Great Britain

Daley and Lee had produced a stunning performance in the synchronised 10m platform to take the gold medal by one point ahead of the Chinese pair Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen

For Daley this was also a very public moment of fulfilment after bronze medals in London and Rio a period that has coincided with marriage to the film producer Dustin Lance Black and the birth of their son Robbie

In the glow of victory Daley spoke with startling clarity about the pressures he has faced in the course of a life lived in the public spotlight

There are more openly out athletes at these Olympic Games than any Olympic Games previously I came out in 2013 and when I was younger I always felt like the one that was alone and different and didnt fit  I hope that any young LGBT person out there can see that no matter how alone you feel right now you are not alone

There was added significance in delivering this message at a table between Chinese athletes and Russian bronze medallists with the media of both nations broadcasting his words Samesex marriage is not legal in either country

Five members of a Hong Kong union behind a series of childrens books about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village have been arrested for sedition

The arrests by the new national security police unit which is spearheading a sweeping crackdown on dissent are the latest action against prodemocracy activists since huge and often violent protests convulsed the city two years ago

Police said on Thursday that the two men and three women aged between 25 and 28 had conspired to publish distribute exhibit or copy seditious publications

The group was attempting to stir up the publics  and especially young childrens  hatred towards Hong Kongs government and judiciary and to incite violence and illegal acts police said in their statement

In recent months the union published three illustrated ebooks that try to explain Hong Kongs democracy movement to children

The first book titled Guardians of Sheep Village explains the 2019 prodemocracy protests that swept through Hong Kong with supporters portrayed as sheep living in a village surrounded by wolves

Janitors of Sheep Village the second book sees cleaners in the village go on strike to force out wolves who leave litter everywhere The introduction explains it is a reference to Hong Kong medical workers striking last year in a bid to force the government to close the border with mainland China at the start of the pandemic

The final book in the trilogy  The 12 Braves of Sheep Village  is about a group of sheep who flee their village by boat because of the wolves It is a direct reference to 12 Hongkongers who made a failed bid to escape by speedboat last year to Taiwan but were detained by the Chinese coastguard and jailed

Sedition is a colonialera law that until last year had not been used since Hong Kongs 1997 handover to China It carries up to two years in jail for a first offence Police and prosecutors are now regularly using it alongside the national security law to clamp down on political speech and views

Most of those arrested for such crimes are denied bail

It is such an honour

The gold medalwinning rower Mohamed Sbihi will make history tomorrow as the first Muslim to carry the British flag at an Olympic opening ceremony

He will be joined by another gold medallist the sailor Hannah Mills a campaigner for clean oceans and the eradication of single use plastic in sport

It is the first time that two competitors will be able to carry the flag after the IOC announced last year that each national Olympic committee could nominate one female and one male athlete as flag bearers

It is such an honour Sbihi who won a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in the mens four said It is an iconic moment within the Olympic movement  people remember those images

He added Ive won a medal been to the closing ceremony but now to actually turn up at an opening ceremony and be at the head of the team alongside Hannah will be a lifetime memory that I will never forget

Mills who will be defending her womens 470 title alongside Eilidh McIntyre in Tokyo said being chosen was the greatest honour in my career and I hope more than ever before that this Games can lift our country and deliver some incredible sporting moments to inspire the nation

Sbihi and Mills follow in the footsteps of some of Team GBs most legendary athletes including Sir Andy Murray rowers Sir Matthew Pinsent and Sir Steve Redgrave and also Anita Lonsborough the first woman to carry the flag for Team GB in Tokyo in 1964

Last week more than 200 people were killed and thousands arrested in civil unrest that saw hundreds of stores looted factories set ablaze and government infrastructure destroyed

On the first day of the Olympics there was not a single shot of an athlete taking a knee on the official Tokyo 2020 live blog Facebook and Twitter pages or Instagram 

But the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have now performed a Uturn over their stance to stop their social media teams from posting pictures of athletes taking the knee at these Games

The decision comes after the Guardian revealed they had issued a diktat against showing such images just hours before Team GBs womens first football match against Chile on Wednesday United States and Sweden players as well as those from New Zealand all also took a knee in protest against racism

An insider told guardiansport they found the IOCs stance odd given the organisation celebrates iconic pictures of protest  including Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists to protest against the unfair treatment of black people in the United States at the 1968 Olympics

However on Thursday morning Tokyo time on Twitter the Olympics account tweeted a picture of Lucy Bronze taking a knee  along with a message Sports started yesterday Just some of the highlights Japan starting strong in softball Teams were kneeling before the competition

Athletes at these Games are allowed to protest after the IOC relaxed Rule 50 which had previously forbidden athletes to make any kind of demonstration or political religious or racial propaganda in any Olympic sites venues or other areas

Peaceful protest is now allowed on the field of play provided it is done without disruption and with respect for fellow competitors However sanctions are still threatened for any protests made on the medal podium

Did you know public street harassment is not illegal in the UK

That is likely to change though under plans being drawn up by the government as part of its longawaited strategy to tackle violence against women and girls VAWG for England and Wales

A new street harassment law has long been called for by campaigners  and while the home secretary Priti Patel was reported to be reluctant to introduce such a law previously  she has now said she is determined to give the police the powers they need to crack down on perpetrators and carry out their duties to protect the public whilst providing victims with the care and support they deserve

More than 180000 people responded to a consultation on the new violence against women strategy the majority of them following the murder of Sarah Everard who was killed while walking home from a friends house in Clapham south London in March

The use of nondisclosure agreements NDAs in cases of sexual harassment and abuse in higher education settings could be also be banned after a review

The strategy will also see the launch of a new StreetSafe app allowing women and girls to record where they feel unsafe as well as a public health campaign which will focus on perpetrator behaviour

A 5m safety of women at night fund will concentrate on innovative projects such as the widely criticised pilot to put undercover policemen in bars and nightclubs to keep women safe

From guardianus The air quality in New York City is currently among the worst in the world as cities across the eastern US were shrouded in smoke from wildfires raging several thousand miles away on the countrys west coast

State officials in New York advised vulnerable people such as those with asthma and heart disease to avoid strenuous outdoor activity as air pollution soared to eclipse Lima in Peru and Kolkata in India to be ranked as the worst in the world on Tuesday

Smoke from more than 80 major wildfires burning in the US west has caused hazy skies and plunging air quality in eastern American and Canadian cities including Philadelphia Washington DC Pittsburgh and Toronto as well as New York

On Wednesday morning the air quality index surged to 157 in Manhattan well above the threshold of 100 where health is considered to be threatened Vulnerable people include pregnant women and the elderly as well as even those outside these groups can experience breathing difficulty throat irritation and runny eyes when exposed to air this bad

I think its unusual to have this kind of haze I dont recall seeing this kind of thing said George Pope professor of earth and environmental studies at Montclair State University who added that he could not see Manhattan from his New Jersey office You can pretty much always see the skyline at least a silhouette if its a hazy day This is like this is unprecedented

The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have banned their social media teams from posting pictures of athletes taking the knee at these Olympic Games the Guardian can reveal

An insider said the message was delivered from on high on Tuesday evening Tokyo time with a specific reference to Team GBs womens first football match against Chile just hours before it kicked off in Sapporo on Wednesday

The image of both teams taking the knee beforehand in a protest against racism and online hate was seen on live TV and the gesture was then followed by United States and Sweden players as well as those from New Zealand The players of Team Australia chose to stand

None of these powerful pictures were posted on the official Tokyo 2020 live blog or its Facebook and Twitter pages or its Instagram site which has more than half a million followers They were also not seen on any of the IOCs social channels

Speaking after the match against Chile Steph Houghton one of Team GBs three captains said the decision to take a knee was supported by the entire squad As players in Great Britain weve been taking the knee in club and international matches and we felt strongly as a group that we wanted to show support for those affected by discrimination and equality she added

It was a proud moment because the Chile players took the knee too to show how united we are as sport

In the 1960s Funk took part in the Women in Space Program where she excelled in its rigorous training for female astronauts But after it was abruptly shut down in 1962 she was forced to forge a new path as a trailblazing pilot

Another chance came along fourteen years later when NASA opened its astronaut applications up to women in 1976 Funk applied three times but was turned down each time

But today she joined Jeff Bezos on his Blue Origin flight and made history as the oldest person to go to space After landing she said I want to go again fast

Describing the experience Funk said When I went up this morning the noise wasnt quite as bad as expected and we went right on up and I saw darkness I thought I was going to see the world but we werent quite high enough

I felt great I felt like I was just laying down and I was going into space

After the disappointment of the 1960s Funk went on to become a flight instructor She said she had taught more than 3000 people to fly Ive always done everything on my own she said I didnt do dolls I did outside stuff and I flew airplanes 19000something hours I loved it

Would a male competitor be similarly criticised

Double Paralympic world champion Olivia Breen asked this question after being told that her competition briefs were too short and inappropriate by a female official while competing at the English Championships in Bedford this weekend

The 24yearold who is set to compete at the Paralympics in Tokyo next month said she was wearing official Adidas briefs for 2021  and questioned whether a male athlete would ever have been subjected to such comments

I am alway grateful for the incredible volunteers who officiate at athletics events said Breen who has cerebral palsy They do an amazing job and make it possible for us to compete However tonight I feel disappointed because just as I finished my long jump competition one of the female officials felt it necessary to inform me that my sprint briefs were too short and inappropriate I was left speechless

I have been wearing the same sprint style briefs for many years and they are specifically designed for competing in she added I will hopefully be wearing them in Tokyo It made me question whether a male competitor would be similarly criticised

An England Athletics spokesperson said We are aware of the post and will be investigating as a matter of urgency The wellbeing of all participants in athletics is of the utmost importance and everyone should feel comfortable to compete and participate in the sport

This photo is of Joannah Stutchbury in 2018 resisting bulldozers threatening Kenyas Kiambu forest

Last week the prominent environment activist was killed  shot dead near her home in Nairobi  after receiving multiple death threats following her campaign against the development of wetlands in a national park

Friends said the 67yearold had stopped her car to clear branches blocking her driveway when she was shot several times

Neighbours found her body in the car with the engine still running and valuables still in the vehicle suggesting the attack was not a robbery

Stutchbury had vocally opposed attempts by powerful local business owners to build on the nearby Kiambu forest and had received death threats in the past

It is really awful The conservation fraternity is very shaken It is devastating said Dr Paula Kahumbu the CEO of WildlifeDirect a conservation NGO

The Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta condemned the killing For the longest time Joannah has been a steadfast champion for the conservation of our environment and is remembered for her relentless efforts to protect Kiambu forest from encroachment he said

Though Kenyas natural heritage is a main source of tourist revenue it is threatened by encroachment squatters and developers often with links to powerful local politicians

Stutchburys killing is only one of a number of violent deaths of conservationists in recent years In 2018 Esmond Bradley Martin a Kenyabased American conservationist whose investigations of the elephant ivory and rhino horn trades were considered critical in efforts to protect the threatened species was stabbed to death in his Nairobi home His murder remains unresolved

Calling all customers theres a giant food monopoly in aisle one And two three four five and six 

Weve designed this game using the findings of a joint investigation weve done with Food and Water Watch We found that consumer choice in the US is largely an illusion  despite supermarket shelves and fridges brimming with different brands

In fact a few powerful transnational companies dominate every link of the food supply chain from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to cereals and beers

The size power and profits of these mega companies have expanded thanks to political lobbying and weak regulation which enabled a wave of unchecked mergers and acquisitions

This matters because the size and influence of these megacompanies enables them to largely dictate what Americas two million farmers grow and how much they are paid as well as what consumers eat and how much our groceries cost

Overall a handful of powerful companies control the majority market share of almost 80 of dozens of grocery items bought regularly by ordinary Americans our analysis reveals

But we dont want to spoil the game too much

Have you seen a sweeter video this week

Jacksons Animal Rescue in the UK posted this clip of three hoglets being served breakfast after being rescued

Mindy Aragorn and Gimli were given specially formulated puppy milk and kitten food  because  in case you didnt know  the prickly animals  who are known for their voracious appetites are also lactose intolerant

According to estimates the number of hedgehogs in Britain have declined by 90 since the second world war because of a loss of habitat and food on farmland

Conservation groups are trying to create suitable places for hedgehogs to thrive such as collections of urban gardens and less manicured parks  and there is of course the efforts of rescue centres like jacksonsanimalrescue

We then wean them onto solid food when old enough and once a healthy size and weight we release them back into the wild a trustee at Jacksons Animal Rescue Greer Lacey

In an interview with the Guardian published last month ianmckellen told us during rehearsals cast mates of all ages have said they keep forgetting whether hes 80odd or 30odd Ive been having the time of my life

By the sound of it the new production  one of the years hottest stage tickets  will have fun with the crisscrossing age dynamics as a youngish character inhabits an older mans body as an experienced pro brings all his technical nous to bear on a role thats traditionally played by an actor nearer the start of a career than the end

When I was young I was always playing old parts McKellen says And of course I was having to imagine it Because what does old mean I had no idea Now that Im old I do know And I also know what its like to be young Because as you get older inside youre ageless Inside Quite honestly I feel about 12

The largest ever international study of people with long Covid has identified more than 200 symptoms and prompted researchers to call for a national screening programme

The study published in a Lancet medical journal surveyed 3762 people with confirmed or suspected long Covid from 56 countries It identified 203 symptoms which spanned 10 of the bodys organ systems The research found a third of the symptoms continued to affect patients for at least six months

Athena Akrami a neuroscientist at University College London and senior author of the study said A lot of postCovid clinics in the UK have focused on respiratory rehabilitation Its true that a lot of people have shortness of breath but they also have a lot of other problems and types of symptoms that the clinics need to provide a more holistic approach to

She said that she was still experiencing symptoms 16 months after becoming infected with coronavirus adding There are likely to be tens of thousands of long Covid patients suffering in silence unsure that their symptoms are connected to Covid19

Climate chance isnt abstract anymore We are experiencing it up close and painfully

These photos show Bad NeuenahrAhrweiler in the German state of RhinelandPalatinate before and after catastrophic flooding Around 1300 people are unaccounted for in the district the regional administration said on Friday

I fear that we will only see the full extent of the disaster in the coming days German chancellor Angela Merkel said from Washington late on Thursday calling it a day characterised by fear by despair by suffering

The death toll from the floods in Germany and Belgium have risen to more than 100

In Germany parts of RhinelandPalatinate and North RhineWestphalia were inundated with 148 litres of rain per sq metre within 48 hours in an area of the country that usually sees about 80 litres in the whole of July

Authorities said 93 people had died in the two states including at least nine residents of an assisted living facility for people with disabilities in RhinelandPalatinate

Belgian authorities said on Friday morning the countrys death toll had risen to 12 Switzerland Luxembourg and the Netherlands have also been severely affected by flooding but have so far reported no loss of life

The intensity and scale of the devastation this week have shocked climate scientists who did not expect records to be broken this much over such a wide area or this soon

After the deadly heatwave in the US and Canada where temperatures rose above 496C two weeks ago the deluge in central Europe has raised fears that humancaused climate disruption is making extreme weather even worse than predicted

Malu Dreyer the governor of RhinelandPalatinate said the disaster showed the need to speed up efforts to curb global warming Weve experienced droughts heavy rain and flooding events several years in a row including in our state she said Climate chance isnt abstract anymore We are experiencing it up close and painfully

To mark the bicentenary of Napoleon Bonapartes death Sothebys in Paris has announced one of his distinctive black felt hats  perhaps worn during his armys crushing defeat of Russia in 1807  will appear at auction

The bicorne hat on sale is believed to have been worn by Napoleon when he held the title of Emperor of the French and as he signed the peace treaties of Tilsit that carved up continental Europe into different zones of French and Russian influence

The hat was previously bought in 1814 by the politician and aristocrat Sir Michael ShawStewart who had become somewhat obsessed by Napoleon He bought it to his family estate in Scotland and then it was passed down from generation to generation

Only 19 bicornes have been identified as belonging to Napoleon many of them in museum collections Its sale in September comes with an estimate of 400000 to 600000 341000 to 512000

Napoleon died aged 51 in exile on the British island of Saint Helena in May 1821  and still continues to split opinion He is celebrated by some as a brilliant military strategist and damned by others as a ruthless warmongering dictator

For the first time ever scientists have confirmed the Amazon rainforest is now emitting more carbon dioxide than it is able to absorb

The giant forest had previously been a carbon sink absorbing the emissions driving the climate crisis but is now causing its acceleration researchers said

The emissions amount to a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year according to a study Most are caused by fires many deliberately set to clear land for beef and soy production But even without fires hotter temperatures and droughts mean the southeastern Amazon has become a source of CO2 rather than a sink

Growing trees and plants have taken up about a quarter of all fossil fuel emissions since 1960 with the Amazon playing a major role as the largest tropical forest Losing the Amazons power to capture CO2 is a stark warning that slashing emissions from fossil fuels is more urgent than ever scientists said

The government of Brazils president Jair Bolsonaro has been harshly criticised for encouraging more deforestation which has surged to a 12year high while fires hit their highest level in June since 2007

This is the deeply moving moment a Chinese father was reunited with his son 24 years after he was abducted by human traffickers in front of their home in Shandong at the age of two in 1997

Guo Gangtang spent more than two decades crisscrossing the country travelling more than 300000 miles on a motorbike with two banners each showing a photo of his son Guo Xinzhen

After nearly a quartercentury odyssey their reunion on Tuesday was held at a police station and reported across the country On social media related hashtags have been read hundreds of millions of times with many people sending well wishes to them

Shortly after Guos son was abducted he began to travel across more than 20 Chinese provinces to look for clues He suffered broken bones in traffic accidents and damaged 10 other motorcycles

Only by hitting the road looking for my son did I feel I am a father he once told Chinese media

In 2015 their story also inspired a movie Lost and Love starring Hong Kong megacelebrity Andy Lau Lau said this week that he felt extremely happy and inspired to learn of the news while pleading with the public to support the governments antihuman trafficking campaign

Child abduction has been a problem in China for decades with thousands of children being snatched by traffickers every year Though authorities say that with the help of new technologies and bioscience more and more families are being reunited in recent years

A group of cancer researchers are calling for the link between alcohol and cancer to be highlighted after estimating it caused more than 740000 cancer cases around the world last year

The study published in The Lancet Oncology  a world leading clinical journal  claims there is strong evidence that alcohol consumption can cause various cancers including those of the breast liver colon rectum oropharynx larynx and oesophagus It also suggests that even low levels of drinking can increase the risk

Harriet Rumgay of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in France and a coauthor of the study said alcohol caused a substantial burden of cancer globally and this was shown even at lower levels of drinking

The results suggested alcohol consumption was behind an estimated 568700 cancer cases in men and 172600 cases in women in 2020

According to a separate study produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer published in February there were an estimated 193 million new cancer cases in 2020 and almost 10 million cancer deaths

Rumgay said It would be very interesting to estimate cancer deaths due to alcohol which is a followup step from the analysis that we have done here But researchers have first suggested that alcohol labels should have cancer warnings that there could be higher taxes on alcohol and that marketing of drinks could be reduced

How did they make their calculations for this study  and do the findings differ by region Tap the link in bio to read more

As wildfires burn throughout the US west on the heels of record heatwaves experts are warning that the region is caught in a vicious feedback cycle of extreme heat drought and fire all amplified by the climate crisis

More than 60 wildfires were burning across at least 10 states in the parched American west on Tuesday with the largest in Oregon consuming an area nearly twice the size of Portland

The fires erupted as the west was in the grip of the second bout of dangerously high temperatures in just a few weeks

The fires have torched homes and forced thousands to evacuate from Alaska to Wyoming according to the National Interagency Fire Center Arizona Idaho and Montana accounted for more than half of the large active fires

The July heatwave follows an unusual June siege of broiling temperatures in the west and comes amid worsening drought conditions throughout the region

Authorities in Minnesota have appealed to aquarium owners to stop releasing pet fish into waterways after several huge goldfish were pulled from a local lake

Officials in Burnsville about 15 miles south of Minneapolis said released goldfish can grow to several times their normal size and wreak havoc on indigenous species

Please dont release your pet goldfish into ponds and lakes the city tweeted They grow bigger than you think and contribute to poor water quality by mucking up the bottom sediments and uprooting plants

Last November officials in nearby Carver county removed as many as 50000 goldfish from local waters The county water management manager Paul Moline said goldfish are an understudied species with a high potential to negatively impact the water quality of lakes

Like carp goldfish can easily reproduce and survive through low levels of oxygen during the Minnesota winter

A few goldfish might seem to some like a harmless addition to the local water body  but theyre not the states department of natural resources advised

Im here because of hunger because theres no medicine because of power cuts  because theres a lack of everything 

These were the words of a man in his 40s  who didnt want to give his name for fear of reprisals  as he joined the biggest mass demonstrations for three decades have rippled through Cuba

Since the pandemic which has gutted tourism revenue Cubans have become accustomed to waiting in line for hours to buy basic goods and theres a lack of medicine in the pharmacies

With millions of Cubans now with mobile internet on their phones news of the protests quickly swept across the country By early afternoon thousands marched through central Havana chanting homeland and life and freedom

At 3pm local time on Sunday all television channels were interrupted with a broadcast from President Miguel DazCanel who said that destabilisation in our country He added We call upon all the revolutionaries of the country all the communists to take to the streets

Italy are champions of Europe again for the first time since 1968 breaking English hearts in the process

The 120 minutes had been nerveshredding England enjoying early elation when Luke Shaw scored his first ever international goal a magnificent halfvolley with the games first move And then came what felt like the slow and inexorable trudge towards defeat

Gareth Southgates team had been comfortable in the first half but the final slid away from them thereafter Italy turning up the temperature pinning England back

Italy got the equaliser that they deserved through Leonardo Bonucci and during extra time the spectre of penalties hung heavy When they came England lost their nerve  missing three of their kicks

It was a night when sporting immortality had beckoned for England a first trophy since the World Cup of 1966 In the end it would be a depressingly familiar hard luck story

For Italy it was a second European Championship and glory for Roberto Mancini whose work since taking over as the manager from Gian Piero Ventura after the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup has been little short of sensational

Italy had the knowhow they have almost forgotten what defeat is They are unbeaten in 34 matches a run that spans nearly three years

Which face do you feel the strongest emotional response to

Whether in a cloud the front of a car or even a toasted sandwich seeing faces in inanimate objects is a common experience

According to new research by the University of Sydney our brains detect and respond emotionally to these illusory faces the same way they do to real human faces

Once considered a symptom of psychosis seeing faces in everyday objects arises from an error in visual perception

Lead researcher Prof David Alais said human brains are evolutionarily hardwired to recognise faces with highly specialised brain regions for facial detection and processing

We are such a sophisticated social species and face recognition is very important Alais said You need to recognise who it is is it family is it a friend or foe what are their intentions and emotions

Faces are detected incredibly fast The brain seems to do this using a kind of templatematching procedure so if it sees an object that appears to have two eyes above a nose above a mouth then it goes Oh Im seeing a face

Its a bit fast and loose and sometimes it makes mistakes so something that resembles a face will often trigger this template match

In the research when people were shown a jumble of real human faces and faces in inanimate objects the latter were processed in the same way we would normally process emotion in a real face

Giant pandas are no longer endangered in the wild but they are still vulnerable with a population outside captivity of 1800 Chinese officials have said after years of conservation efforts

The head of the environment ministrys department of nature and ecology conservation Cui Shuhong said the reclassification was the result of improved living conditions and Chinas efforts in keeping their habitats integrated

He said the announcement reflected Chinas national efforts to preserve biodiversity in recent years The authorities have worked to expand giant pandas habitats and replanted bamboo forests to feed them

The number of Siberian tigers amur leopards Asian elephants and crested ibis have also visibly increased as a result of continuing conservation efforts in recent years Cui told a press conference this week

The decision by Chinas own conservation authority comes five years after the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN removed giant pandas from its endangered species list and classified them as vulnerable

This weeks announcement was met with delight on social media Related hashtags on Weibo have been read nearly 10m times

Pandas however still face longterm threats IUCN has said climate change could destroy more than 35 of their bamboo habitat in the next 80 years

Mussels on Canadas coast were effectively cooked by the abnormally warm water following last weeks record heatwave

More than 1 billion marine animals along Canadas Pacific coast are likely to have died experts warn highlighting the vulnerability of ecosystems that arent used to such extreme temperatures

The heat dome that settled over western Canada and the northwestern US for five days pushed temperatures in communities along the coast to 40C 104F  shattering longstanding records and offering little respite for days

The intense and unrelenting heat is believed to have killed as many as 500 people in the province of British Columbia and contributed to the hundreds of wildfires currently burning across the area

Christopher Harley a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia who calculated the 1 billion figure said The shore doesnt usually crunch when you walk on it But there were so many empty mussel shells lying everywhere that you just couldnt avoid stepping on dead animals while walking around

Harley was struck by the smell of rotting mussels Snails sea stars and clams were decaying in the shallow water It was an overpowering visceral experience he said

The mass death of shellfish would temporarily affect water quality because mussels and clams help filter the sea Harley said keeping it clear enough that sunlight reaches the eelgrass beds while also creating habitats for other species

Experts have cautioned that the province needs to adapt to the reality that sudden and sustained heatwaves are likely to become more common as a result of climate change

It is almost a year to the day that Venezuelan couple Hayde and Juan Carlos Rodrguez first spotted an injured sloth lying by the side of the road Trying to cross from one tree to another the animal had climbed on to a highvoltage power line and been electrocuted

The animal had lost the claws on three of its paws because of burns and the Rodrguezes were told by a local wildlife expert that it was not likely to survive and that they should leave it to die

Today the sloth is not only thriving but has proved the inspiration for the couple to create what they believe to be Venezuelas first dedicated sloth rescue and rehabilitation centre

We humans have invaded their space When they cant move from tree to tree they get confused and climb on to power lines Thats how they meet their death Hayde says

In the last five months Juan Carlos and Hayde have rescued 41 sloths and returned 36 of them to the lush greenery where they are often found

Their work is vital considering the state of wildlife rehabilitation and conservation in the country which has been underfunded for years

Venezuela is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world its rich ecosystems have been eroded by gold mining and other industrial activities

Amber Heards baby announcement has attracted huge attention  not only because of her celebrity  but because she is part of what seems to be a growing trend of women becoming single mothers by choice

Heard is in a relationship with the cinematographer Bianca Butti but is reportedly the sole legal parent of her daughter Oonagh Paige Heard who was born in April The actor says she decided to get pregnant before meeting her partner

Four years ago I decided I wanted to have a child Heard wrote in an Instagram post last Thursday I wanted to do it on my own terms I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way I hope we arrive at a point in which its normalised to not want a ring in order to have a crib

Statistics point to an increase in the number of IVF cycles undertaken by single women in the UK and celebrities such as the musician Natalie Imbruglia have helped to normalise women choosing to have a child alone

Just in England are only one step away from bringing it home

Theyve reached their first final at a major mens tournament since 1966 after a 21 extratime win over Denmark Harry Kanes goal scored on the rebound after Kasper Schmeichel had saved his penalty earned victory on a nerveshredding night at Wembley

Mikkel Damsgaard had fired Denmark ahead with half an hour played beating Jordan Pickford with a superb strike from a 25yard freekick England rallied and five minutes before the break Bukayo Sakas low cross towards Sterling was turned in by Danish defender Simon Kjr

England cranked up the pressure in extratime with Kane and Jack Grealish going close before Raheem Sterling went down in the penalty area under pressure from Joakim Mhle and Mathias Jensen

The referee Danny Makkelie pointed to the spot and while replays showed minimal contact VAR did not overturn the decision Kane stepped up and Schmeichel went the right way but the forward pounced on the rebound to send Wembley into raptures scenes that only intensified upon the final whistle

The president of Haiti Jovenel Mose has been shot dead in his home by a group of armed men who also seriously injured his wife according to a statement made by the countrys interim prime minister

Claude Joseph condemned the assassination as a hateful inhumane and barbaric act He told a local radio station that the attack was carried out by an armed commando group that included foreigners

The assassination is likely to plunge the Caribbean nation into further turmoil after several years marked by political unrest and violence as well as a growing humanitarian crisis and shortages of food

Moise had faced fierce protests since he took office as president in 2017 The opposition accused him this year of seeking to install a dictatorship by overstaying his mandate and becoming more authoritarian  charges he denied

He had been ruling by decree for more than a year after the country failed to hold legislative elections and wanted to push through controversial constitutional changes

There have been intermittent periods of protests and street violence and a rise in gang violence in the country some of it tied to political parties

So where does this leave Haiti now

Canada will have its first ever Indigenous governor general after prime minister Justin Trudeau appointed Inuk leader Mary Simon to the post

The former ambassador journalist and longtime advocate of Inuit rights will represent Canadas head of state Queen Elizabeth II

While the role is largely ceremonial performing functions such as swearing in governments and formally signing legislation the governor general is also the commanderinchief of the military and can summon prorogue or dissolve parliament

Describing the move as a historic step Trudeau announced Simons appointment on Tuesday almost six months after his previous selection resigned following allegations of bullying

I am honoured humbled and ready to be Canadas first Indigenous Governor General Simon said also giving remarks in Inuktitut her first language I can confidently say that my appointment is a historic and inspirational moment for Canada and an important step forward on the long path towards reconciliation

Her appointment comes as the country reckons with the discovery of more than 1000 unmarked graves at the site of former churchrun schools for Indigenous children

In her remarks on Tuesday Simon spoke of the need for Canada to fully recognize memorialize and come to terms with the atrocities of our collective past as more is learned about the legacy of residential schools

Its 160squarefoot 15 sq metre  and just a few footsteps separate the bed and bathroom  in this unusual rental in Canada

The Vancouver apartment described as ideal for a single individual looking to live downtown at an affordable rate and who does not need much space was listed on Craigslist this month

The rental was removed after a few days but not before being picked up by the website Vancouver is Awesome which points out the apartments size is smaller than the citys 250squarefoot 23 sq metre definition of a micro dwelling

Its layout means the toilet is in direct line of sight of the bed without a door  though the shower is hidden behind the vanity unit It also doesnt include a kitchen

Vancouver is the seventh most expensive housing market in the world according to a 2020 survey by commercial real estate firm CBRE ahead of Los Angeles Paris and New York

The micro apartments rent of C680 US550 or 396 a month is still more than half the citys average

An upmarket Russian supermarket chain has been accused of cowardice by Moscow liberals and other Russian LGBTQ allies after removing an advert featuring a lesbian couple who shopped at its store

VkusVill issued a public apology after being on the end of a conservative backlash for offering a modest portrayal of queer life in Russia

The ad was seen as a challenge to Russias gay propaganda law that bans the promotion of nontraditional sexual relations to minors

It featured a lesbian couple Yuma and Zhenya and their children Mila and Alina who said they enjoyed the supermarkets onigiri rice balls with mushrooms and that their favourite product was the hummus

The original post which bore an 18 warning to comply with local legislation read We believe not featuring the families of our real customers would be hypocritical

But days later the ad was gone In its place the chain ran an apology that prominently featured photographs of heterosexual couples and appeared to place the blame for the ad on a small group of its staff

A VkusVill representative declined to answer questions from the Guardian about whether the supermarket chain had been pressed to pull the ad

It was a beautifully simple idea one family photographed at the same time every year 

In the summer of 1991 photographer zednelson then 25 invited a couple of new parents hed met at a party to visit his London studio Oh and bring your newborn baby he said

He would chart the evolution of a parenting life with Sue fixed in position on the right of the picture Frank on the left Eddie inching up between his mum and dad Same backdrop same lights same camera same angle Nelson explains adding Every year I measure out the distances to the inch It drives us all a bit mad But we do keep coming back

When Sue looks back at the very earliest photograph in the selection she remembers the intense sensation of parental duty When you first have a child you think its going to go on for ever just because of that intensity Actually the three decades since then have gone in a flash Like a movie on fast forward These photos make me realise the sheer speed of time passing

When we started it was a predigital era preinternet says Frank and we didnt give any thought to what would happen in the future Theres no way all those years ago we would have asked ourselves What will this all look like in 2021

Migration is not the biggest challenge facing the world

Its global inequality

Thats according to research from the development agency MIDEQHub and their partners in 11 countries in the Global South Brazil Burkina Faso China Cte dIvoire Egypt Ethiopia Ghana Haiti Malaysia Nepal and South Africa

Theyve produced a new animation  illustrated by karriefransman and in partnership with posnegorg  challenging many of the ideas that currently dominate media representations of migration

Professor Heaven Crawley Chair in International Migration and Director of MIDEQ said For too long the story of migration has been dominated by the views and interests of the Global North This story has focused on issues of security and border controls ignoring the complex factors that drive people to move in different parts of the world

Migration is a part of our history and will inevitably be part of our future If we want migration to work for everyone then we need to better understand and address the structural inequalities  poverty gender inequalities racism  that drive migration and limit its potential to contribute to development

Boris Johnson admitted privately that him becoming UK prime minister would be a ludicrous idea three years before he took the top job his former aide Dominic Cummings has claimed

In another scathing blogpost detailing the political machinations that led up to and followed Brexit the exNo 10 adviser alleged that Johnson had admitted immediately after the referendum in 2016 that he was unfit to lead the country

Cummings said Johnson had pulled him to one side in Vote Leave headquarters the morning that David Cameron resigned and the pair had discussed what should happen next Obviously its ludicrous me being PM  but no more ludicrous than Dave or George Osborne dont you think Johnson is said to have told Cummings

On his subscriberonly blog Cummings also argued that the best way of understanding Boris Johnson is realising that he operates in two modes BorisNormal his routine chaotic mode and BorisSelfAware his ruthless effective mode

Boris is complex portrayed as simple Behind each mask lies another mask  but theres no masterplan behind all the masks just the age old will to power Cummings wrote

Cummings who often avoided scrutiny during his time in government has set about trying to trash Johnsons reputation since leaving Downing Street last winter Last month he wrote a 7000word essay attacking Johnsons chronic dysfunction and published texts from the PM calling his thenhealth minister Matt Hancock totally fucking hopeless

At the time Downing Street refused to comment on Cummings claims while also declining to deny the veracity of the screenshots or to reject the specific claims I dont plan to get into the detail of whats been published Johnsons spokesperson said Asked if the images of the PMs messages were genuine he said Our focus is on not examining those specific images but delivering on the publics priorities

From guardiansport A Danish supporter has spoken about the moment he had a rainbow flag confiscated before the Euro 2020 quarterfinal against the Czech Republic in Baku

Denmark won the game 21 and will now take on England at Wembley for a place in the final but for Kristoffer Fns the incident left a sour taste on an otherwise enjoyable evening

An official guard came up to be and pulled the flag out of my hands he told Danish public broadcaster DR He had been watching from home earlier in the tournament and seen the news that the Allianz Arena in Munich could not be lit up in rainbow colours for the visit of Hungary in the group stage

Uefa said in a statement on that occasion that it had no choice than to reject the action on the grounds that it contravened its regulations as a political and neutral organisation It said due to the political context of the application a message aiming at a decision taken by the Hungarian national parliament Uefa had to decline the request

Fns added I thought before going to Baku that we are going to a place where human rights are not really a thing I have been very sceptical about the fact that the World Cup is being held in Qatar so I thought that I would be a hypocrite if I didnt do anything

Yes this is real It may look like CGI but a whirling vortex of fire really erupted on the surface of the ocean near Mexicos Yucatan peninsulia on Friday 

The countrys state oil company Pemex blamed a gas leak from an underwater pipeline for sparking the blaze

The fire took more than five hours to fully put out according to the company It began in an underwater pipeline that connects to a platform at Pemexs flagship Ku Maloob Zaap oil development

The blaze was dubbed an eye of fire on social media due to its circular shape as it raged a short distance from a Pemex oil platform

Coming after a week of fatal heatwaves across the Pacific northwest and the revelation that Exxon lobbyists boasted of their relationships with US lawmakers to an undercover Greenpeace journalist the fire has further ignited the ire of activists and lawmakers 

Shout out to all the legislators going out on dinner dates with Exxon lobbyists tweeted Alexandria OcasioCortez in response the the video so they can say a Green New Deal is too expensive 

Meanwhile others mocked the focus on personal responsibility that often dominates the climate conversation with one Twitter user commenting we must not be using enough paper straws

A trailblazing female pilot denied the job of astronaut in the 1960s over her gender is finally getting the chance to fulfil her dreams of going into space

Billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has announced that 82yearold Wally Funk will be part of a fourperson crew set to be launched into space by Blue Origin during a 10minute flight on his rocket New Shepard later this month

Funk who says she taught over 3000 people to fly will be the oldest person ever to travel into space after the late John Glenn set the current record at age 77 while aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998

In 1961 Funk volunteered to be part of a program to get women to qualify for Nasas astronaut program but it was abruptly cancelled when the federal government decided women shouldnt be allowed to use the military facilities needed for space training

None of the women ever made it into space  but now Funk has the opportunity to do so on 20 July

No one has waited longer said Bezos in his post calling Funk an honored guest

Statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II have been toppled in Canada amid growing outrage over the discovery of unmarked graves belonging to Indigenous children

A group gathered at the Manitoba legislature in Winnipeg and pulled down the statue of Victoria on Canada Day  an annual celebration on 1 July that marks the countrys confederation

Protesters have increasingly targeted historical figures that they see as complicit in the establishment and operation of the notorious residential schools where the remains of children have been found

Members of the group covered the statue and its plinth in red handprints and left a sign that read We were children once Bring them home

During the 19th and 20th centuries at least 150000 Indigenous children were taken from their families to attend the residential schools as part of a campaign by the government to forcefully assimilate the children into Canadian society

Viewers are advised that the following video may contain images of Indigenous people who have died

In Canada 1148 unmarked graves have been discovered on the grounds of former churchrun residential schools where an estimated 150000 First Nations children were sent as part of a campaign of forced assimilation for more than century until 1996

In 2015 a historic truth and reconciliation commission concluded that the residential school system amounted to cultural genocide and that unmarked graves would be found in the former school grounds But these latest findings suggest this is just the tip of the iceberg in uncovering Canadas traumatic colonial past as our reporter Leyland Cecco explains

Just a week after Britney Spearss emotional speech calling for an end to her abusive conservatorship a judge has denied the request to remove her father from his role overseeing the unusual legal arrangement

The decision is not a direct response to the 39yearolds most recent testimony The documents were filed in a response to a request Spearss attorney made last year to remove her father as sole conservator At the time her attorney said Spears was afraid of her father Jamie Spears

In November Los Angeles superior court judge Brenda Penny declined to remove Jamie Spears and added a trust as the coconservator of her estate The documents filed on Wednesday affirm this decision and underline that her father is still a conservator

In her first time speaking in open court last week Spears said she wanted the conservatorship that has controlled her life and money for 13 years to end She said she has been forced to work against her will and that the conservatorship stopped her from removing a contraceptive device in order to try for another child

Earlier this week attorneys for Spearss father filed a petition to ask the court to investigate claims Britney Spears made in her testimony last week The filings asked the court to examine serious allegations regarding forced labor forced medical treatment and therapy improper medical care and limitations on personal rights

The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 14 July though experts have warned there could be a long fight ahead for Spears to get out of the very complex legal arrangement Follow the link in bio to find out why

Typically 165 sudden deaths would occur in the province over that period the provinces chief coroner said suggesting more than 300 deaths could be attributed to the heat The new tally announced on Wednesday marks a 195 increase over normal years

Our thoughts are with people who have lost loved ones said prime minister Justin Trudeau warning the blistering temperatures in a region of the country illprepared for such heat was a reminder of the need to address climate change

Many of those who died over the five day period were seniors lived alone and were found in residences that were hot and not well ventilated officials said

The town of Lytton British Columbia reached 495C 1211F on Tuesday smashing the national record three days in a row Lytton was evacuated on last night after a fire hit the town and threatened residential buildings

The heat dome that blanketed much of western Canada and the United States broke 103 heat records across British Columbia Alberta Yukon and Northwest Territories on Monday

Experts say the heat was so dangerous because it persisted throughout the night in many communities giving residents little relief Because of its typically mild climate residents along the Pacific Coast often dont install air conditioning units

Under current French law only heterosexual couples have the right to access medically assisted procreation methods such as in vitro fertilisation IVF Lesbian couples and single women who want children have to travel abroad for IVF using donor sperm

That is set to change under the bill pushed through by President Emmanuel Macrons government which passed a final vote in the National Assembly on Tuesday after two years of protests and 500 hours of debate

The draft law which was backed by 326 MPs to 115 against with 42 abstentions winds back some of western Europes strictest rules governing medically assisted pregnancies  and will make France the 11th country in the 27member EU to allow medically assisted procreation for lesbian couples and single women alike

The legislation also addresses several issues arising out of the huge increase in the use of fertility treatment in recent years

Controversially it allows children conceived with donor sperm to learn the donors identity when they become adults ending the anonymity that donors in France have been guaranteed until now

And it allows women in their 30s to freeze their eggs  a procedure currently available only to women undergoing treatment for conditions that could affect their fertility such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer

But it stops short at legalising surrogacy a practice used by some couples to have children that is still widely rejected in France
England captain Harry Kane joined Germanys captain Manuel Neuer in wearing rainbowcoloured armbands for their match at Wembley last night to mark the end of Pride month and to show support for LGBTQ communities around the world

It was the first time Kane has donned this armband  while Neuer has worn it for all his Euro 2020 matches in June From our point of view it is a show of solidarity with the German national team from all of us at the England national team to be united in trying to kick out all inequalities there are Kane said

Earlier this month Uefa investigated whether it could be viewed as a political statement before concluding there would be no disciplinary proceedings given the armband was a symbol of diversity and thus the German goalkeeper was promoting a good cause

But last week the governing body was criticised after ruling Munichs Allianz Arena could not be lit up in rainbow colours to support LGBTQ rights for the evenings match between Germany and Hungary because it contravened the governing bodys rules regarding political and religious neutrality The citys mayor said he wanted to protest against a new law in Hungary that forbids gay people from featuring in educational materials in schools or TV shows for those under 18

UEFA said the request itself was political and added the rainbow colours in its own logo saying It is a symbol that embodies our core values promoting everything that we believe in  a more just and egalitarian society tolerant of everyone regardless of their background belief gender or sexual orientation

Three years after she shocked the Democratic establishment and won her New York primary AOC is continuing to hold her party to account  and not just from the inside 

On Monday she joined a lively climate protest outside the White House Organized by the Sunrise Movement activists and a handful of Democratic politicians including Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman marched to put pressure on Joe Biden who they believe is not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis

Along with other progressive Democrats theyve been left disappointed by the infrastructure deal announced by the president last week which only includes trimmed down funding for climate change protections

Responding to protesters chanting AOC OcasioCortez responded with her own chant  GND  referencing the Green New Deal climate resolution that she introduced in 2019 with the Democratic senator Ed Markey and recently reintroduced

They want you to think Oh this is a new idea this is too ambitious this is too crazy How about this The last time we introduced the Civilian Climate Corps in this country we hired and mobilized a quartermillion people in three months OcasioCortez told the crowd referring to the program that was introduced under Franklin D Roosevelts tranformative New Deal in 1933

Were going to get that into this infrastructure bill she added

A weightloss tool that uses magnets to stop people from opening their mouths wide enough to eat solid food has been developed by scientists in order to tackle obesity

The device developed by medical professionals from the University of Otago in New Zealand and scientists from Leeds in the UK can be fitted by dentists and uses magnetic components with locking bolts

It has been criticised online however with people likening it to a medieval torture device and some thought at first it may have been a parody

The University of Otago tweeted that it was a worldfirst weightloss device to help fight the global obesity epidemic an intraoral device that restricts a person to a liquid diet

Called the DentalSlim Diet Control the device allows its users to open their mouths only 2mm wide Initially it was trialled on seven otherwise healthy obese women from Dunedin in New Zealand for two weeks who were given a lowcalorie liquid diet

An article published in the British Dental Journal reported that the group of women lost a mean amount of 636kg  about 51 of their body weight

But participants complained that the device was hard to use causing discomfort with their speech They said they felt tense and that life in general was less satisfying

The University of Otago said To clarify the intention of the device is not intended as a quick or longterm weightloss tool Rather it is aimed to assist people who need to undergo surgery and who cannot have the surgery until they have lost weight

From guardianus Gavin Grimm filed a federal lawsuit in 2015 after he was denied entry to the mens bathrooms at his school And now six years later he has finally been able to declare victory

This is because the US supreme court has rejected a Virginia school boards attempt to reinstate a transgender bathroom ban The justices left in place lowercourt rulings that found the policy unconstitutional

I am glad that my yearslong fight to have my school see me for who I am is over Being forced to use the nurses room a private bathroom and the girls room was humiliating for me and having to go to outoftheway bathrooms severely interfered with my education Grimm said in a statement

Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials he added

Last August the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the board had practiced sexbased discrimination and violated Grimms 14th amendment rights by prohibiting him from using the boys restroom

Judge Henry Floyd wrote The proudest moments of the federal judiciary have been when we affirm the burgeoning values of our bright youth rather than preserve the prejudices of the past

Upholding the decision of the appeals court sets a strong legal precedent But because the supreme court has chosen not to hear the case itself there is still no nationwide ruling on the issue

Cambodian authorities have confiscated a defanged and declawed pet lion that appeared in TikTok videos taken at a villa in the wealthy Boeung Keng Kang district of the capital Phnom Penh

The owner had shared a photo of the lion sitting in a driveway as a dog played nearby There was also a video of it as a young cub being sprayed down with a hose The confiscation comes a day after a Twitter user posted an aerial shot of the creature roaming around a garden

Wildlife Alliance an animal rescue nongovernment organisation that helped with the raid said the conditions of a private residence were inappropriate for a wild animal In addition the lions canine teeth had been removed along with its claws which drastically reduces a lions quality of life it said

The 18monthold male weighing 70kg 154lbs had been imported from overseas by the owner a Chinese national to be raised in his home environment ministry spokesman Neth Pheaktra said

Cambodian authorities started investigating this lion since we saw it on TikTok in late April Pheaktra said on Sunday People have no right to raise rare wildlife as pets

The animal will now be moved to the Phnom Tamao wildlife rescue centre on the outskirts of the capital

While homosexuality remains illegal in Malawi  for few hours over the weekend the streets of the capital Lilongwe were covered in rainbows as about 50 members of the countrys persecuted LBGTQ community took part in the countrys first Pride parade

Marchers donned shirts with rainbow colours and emblazoned with words such as embracing our queerness pride unites world love first and Malawi is for us too as they danced and chanted Viva LGBTI

The risks to those who took part were high as anyone who identifies as anything other than heterosexual faces arrest and imprisonment of of up to 14 years

But those on the streets on Saturday spoke of their joy that in a year during which events had been cancelled across the world their parade was at last taking place during annual Pride month

Andreas 29 said it was a huge moment for his community as he danced to the music and raised a placard above his head I feel so happy to be part of this he said

The organisers of Malawi Pride used the parade to deliver a petition addressed to the president calling on the government to repeal laws that criminalise samesex unions

His story is just one of many being featured in the project Everyone is Good at Something EGS which hopes to challenge the widespread stigma and perception of people with disabilities in India

EGS was launched by photographer Vicky Roy and VR Ferose founder of the India Inclusion Foundation

The law in India is very progressive in terms of protecting the rights of people with disabilities The problem is most people dont know about it says Ferose an engineer based in California who began working on disability rights after his son was born with autism 12 years ago

Roy who is aiming to publish 15000 stories from every state in the country says Hopefully these images will open up discussion of disability and perhaps even influence policy

This brings new meaning to the phrase neighbourhood watch 

This tree  which was cleaved in half  has become an attraction in a residential part of South Yorkshire after a dispute between neighbours

Bharat Mistry 56 said he had been embroiled in a yearlong dispute with the family next door over birds roosting in the tree which they said generated too much noise and mess in the drive of their bungalow

Their nextdoor neighbours then asked tree surgeons to cut down half the branches of the 5 metre conifer tree that had stood in his garden in the Sheffield suburb of Waterthorpe for 25 years

Without Mistrys knowledge an image of the tree was posted on Reddit with the title Some traditional British pettiness on display The image and account have since been deleted but not before going viral One user on Twitter wrote This is the pettiest thing I have ever seen and I love it

Mistry said he had trimmed the tree into a ball shape which his neighbour had agreed with until birds began roosting in the tree He said their relations had previously been amicable and he had trimmed the branches lower down the tree to make space for the neighbours car

Mistry who lives in a threebedroom property with his wife and two daughters asked the neighbours not to have the branches removed but acknowledged they were entitled to do so as the tree protruded by a metre on to their property

The neighbours have refused requests to comment

One woman who wished to remain anonymous said When I saw it I just thought Oh my God what a shame Its a lovely tree and adds to the feature of the house and the street Another neighbour who did not want to be named said It ruins the visual aspect for everyone

This skull just forced scientists to rewrite the history of human evolution 

Analysis of the remains has revealed a new branch of the human family tree that points to a previously unknown sister group more closely related to modern humans than the Neanderthals

The extraordinary fossil has been named a new human species Homo longi or Dragon man by Chinese researchers although other experts are more cautious about the designation

I think this is one of the most important finds of the past 50 years said Prof Chris Stringer research leader at the Natural History Museum in London who worked on the project Its a wonderfully preserved fossil

The skull appears to have a remarkable backstory According to the researchers it was originally found in 1933 by Chinese labourers building a bridge over the Songhua River in Harbin in Chinas northernmost province Heilongjiang during the Japanese occupation To keep the skull from falling into Japanese hands it was wrapped and hidden in an abandoned well resurfacing only in 2018 after the man who hid it told his grandson about it shortly before he died

Derek Chauvin the former Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd has been sentenced to 22 years and six months for seconddegree murder

The 45yearold appeared in court on Friday two months after a jury found him guilty on three charges related to Floyds death

After four victim impact statements from members of the Floyd family including his sevenyearold daughter Gianna prosecutors argued before judge Peter Cahill that Chauvin should face the maximum sentence for a first time offender of 30 years for seconddegree murder

Every day I have begged for justice to be served reliving the execution of George while others begged they pleaded for officer Chauvin to simply just allow George to take a breath Floyds brother Philonise told the court before sentencing as he also requested the maximum sentence I havent had a real nights sleep because of the nightmares I constantly have hearing my brother beg and plead for his life over and over again

Terrence Floyd another of George Floyds brothers directly addressed the former officer who appeared in court wearing a grey suit with a shaved head

I wanted to know from the man himself Chauvin why What were you thinking What was going through your head when you had your knee on my brothers neck When you knew that he posed no threat any more he was handcuffed why you didnt at least get up why you stayed there

Chauvin himself spoke briefly to the court before he was sentenced suggesting that additional legal matters prevented him from speaking at length

Very briefly though I want to give my condolences to the Floyd family theres going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest and I hope some things would give you some peace of mind he said

In a video uploaded to YouTube the twotime president of the National Rifle Association David Keene dons a cap and gown to speak to thousands of students from James Madison Academy on their graduation day

Keene asks the students to uphold the second amendment that their schools namesake James Madison took part in drafting

But when the camera pans there is a haunting scene of thousands of empty white chairs  3044 to be exact  with no students to fill them These represent the seniors from this years graduating class who died from gun violence The school is not a real one

The gun safety organization Change the Ref released a series of videos on Wednesday in which advocates trick progun figures into addressing empty chairs representing high school students who have been shot and killed before they could graduate

The organization was founded by Patricia and Manuel Oliver whose son Joaquin was one of 17 people murdered in the Parkland school shooting in 2018

Were talking about losing your son or daughter I cannot find anything more painful in life than that said Manuel Oliver in one of the films

In a statement Change the Ref said This campaign is not about tricking a couple of NRA members its about showing how thousands of empty chairs during graduations have become a normal American tradition

The latest flareup of violence in the Gaza Strip has been accompanied by a catalogue of violations committed by Israeli police against Palestinians in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem according to research from Amnesty International

Arab citizens of Israel have been subjected to unlawful force from officers during peaceful demonstrations sweeping mass arrests torture and other illtreatment in detention and police have failed to protect Palestinians from premeditated attacks by rightwing Jewish extremists the human rights watchdog has said

Two Israeli police spokespeople have not yet responded to the Guardians requests for comment

Saleh Hijazi Amnesty Internationals deputy regional director for the Middle East and north Africa said Palestinians face a culture of increasing repression and violence from the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian Authority PA in the West Bank

There are always periods where the institutionalised structural violence and discrimination against Palestinians becomes severe but this is the worst it has been in a long time There is a complete disregard for civilian life Hijazi said

Amnesty researchers documented more than 20 cases of Israeli police violence since early May when protests against the eviction of Palestinians from the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah began The unrest became one of the triggers for a new round of confrontation between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip

Hundreds of Palestinians have been injured in the police crackdown and a 17yearold boy shot dead during mostly peaceful demonstrations in Israeli cities and East Jerusalem over the last six weeks

Ingeborg Beugel is a freelance correspondent for Dutch media who has lived on the island Hydra for almost 40 years On 13 June she was arrested and accused of facilitating the illegal stay of a foreigner in Greece after hosting an Afghan asylum seeker in her home

Beugel 61 said Fridoon 23  whose full name we are not sharing for privacy reasons  had been staying with her while appealing against a negative asylum decision She said his original application for asylum in Greece was rejected because of translation problems at his interview

Beugel said it was not a secret that Fridoon had been staying with her and that she has covered his story as a journalist She believes her arrest was in line with other complaints about police and the Greek authorities harassing journalists

Beugel could now face up to a year in prison if charged and convicted Her lawyer said the crime she had been charged with was most often used when prosecuting smuggling cases  and represents a toughening of the official response to refugees and asylum seekers in Greece

The Greek authorities have been approached for comment

The country like other EU states stands accused of pushbacks of migrants and refugees

Last month Guardian analysis found that EU member states used illegal operations to push back at least 40000 asylum seekers from Europes borders during the pandemic methods being linked to the death of more than 2000 people

It comes as Boris Johnson looks to deliver on his pledge to tackle the nations growing obesity crisis The prime minister is said to blame his own health issues for contributing to his hospitalisation with coronavirus last year

The rules which will ban the advertising of products deemed to be high in fat salt and sugar HFSS have been branded as draconian by the advertising industry  and could cost TV broadcasters such as ITV Channel 4 Channel 5 and Sky more than 200m a year in revenue

The tightening of restrictions online mean that paidfor ads on sites including Facebook and Google by big brands will also be banned However companies will be able to show marketing on their own websites and social media accounts

Junk food advertising will still be allowed through audio media such as podcasts and radio and there will be no new restrictions for the outofhome sector which includes billboards poster sites on buses and in locations such as railway stations and airports

Some foods that are high in fat sugar and salt that are not viewed as traditional junk food like honey Marmite and avocados will still be allowed to feature in advertising

Research has found that one in three children leaving primary school are overweight or obese as are almost twothirds of adults in England

From guardiansport a number of German football clubs lit up their stadiums with rainbow colours during the Euro 2020 clash between Germany and Hungary to fill the void after UEFA rejected a request from the Munich mayor to illuminate the Allianz Arena

Several Bundesliga clubs including Wolfsburg Hertha Berlin Eintracht Frankfurt and Cologne all went ahead with the display during the game last night in solidarity with the LGBTQ community in particular in Hungary  where legislation was passed last week by its parliament banning school educational materials or TV shows for under18s that the government considers to be promoting homosexuality or gender change

The planned illumination of Allianz Arena for the match was requested by Munich city council and LGBTQ activists to send a signal of support for inclusivity and diversity

But Uefa said the rainbow lights would contravene its rules about political and religious neutrality so the protest at the stadium couldnt go ahead Days earlier it had ruled that the German teams captain Manuel Neuer had not contravened those rules by wearing a rainbow armband

Instead of the planned display the mayor of Munich instead illuminated a wind turbine by the ground Swipe to see a selection of the best pictures of the rainbow stadiums and more

Despite devastating economic damage caused by the Covid19 pandemic the number of millionaires in the world has increased

There are now 561 million millionaires globally up by 52 million people according to the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report

The figures capture how the rich cashed in on surging stock and house prices  and how emergency interest rate cuts and government stimulus measures often benefited those least in need of state support helping their assets grow in value despite the downturn

According to the latest edition of the International Labor Organization ILO Monitor which was published at the beginning of the year 114 million jobs were lost in 2020 which in combination with workinghour reductions within employment resulted in workinghour losses approximately four times as high as during the financial crisis in 2009

The ILO estimates that the working hours lost in 2020 compared to prepandemic levels were equivalent to 255 million fulltime jobs leading to 37 trillion in lost labor income

Young female footballers are being excluded from matches because of their religious dress

The French Football Federation FFF has banned women from wearing the hijab in official club matches as well as during international games

A controversial bill is being considered by parliament which includes a ban on women under the age of 18 wearing the hijab in public places Critics say this would further stigmatise the estimated 57 million Muslims living in France  and is an example of the continual attacks on religious freedoms over the last two decades

Les Hijabeuses  a growing collective of young hijabwearing players  are campaigning against the FFFs ban as part of a wider battle to promote a more inclusive society in the country where there has been a rise in farright groups and Islamophobia

First there was the bread  now its contents 

A lab test commissioned by the New York Times has failed to identify any tuna DNA in a series of Subway tuna sandwiches

A reporter acquired more than 60 inches worth of Subway tuna sandwiches from three Los Angeles storefronts then engaged a specialized fishtesting lab Researchers were unable to pinpoint a species

Theres two conclusions a lab spokesperson told the Times One its so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out we couldnt make an identification 

Or we got some and theres just nothing there thats tuna

In February when Inside Edition ran a similar test based on samples from New York a Floridabased lab did confirm the presence of tuna

In January two California customers filed a lawsuit claiming the products are made from anything but tuna Subway has fiercely defended the integrity of its tuna supply calling the recent lawsuit baseless 

The fast food franchise which has more than 22000 storefronts across the US and operates in 110 countries and territories has been dogged by legal action including a classaction complaint that said its 5 footlong sandwiches were in fact only 11 to 115in long 

In October last year an Irish court also ruled that the bread served at Subway could not in fact be defined as bread because of its high sugar content

Other sandwich makers have also pointed out that tuna is a relatively inexpensive meat so Subway has little incentive to substitute a cheaper version And seafood experts have suggested Subway may not be to blame if its tuna is in fact not tuna

I dont think a sandwich place would intentionally mislabel Dave Rudie president of Catalina Offshore Products told the Times Theyre buying a can of tuna that says tuna If theres any fraud in this case it happened at the cannery
From espresso to instant coffee is part of the daily routine for so many of us  Now research suggests the drink could be linked to a lower chance of developing or dying from chronic liver disease

The new UK analysis is the latest to suggest drinking coffee could bring benefits with previous work suggesting it may help stave off liver cancer and reduce the risk of alcoholrelated liver disease

The study analysed data from 494585 participants aged between 40 to 69 when signing up  including 384818 who were coffee drinkers at the outset compared with 109767 who did not consume the beverage

Looking at the liver health of the participants over a median period of almost 11 years the researchers found 3600 cases of chronic liver disease with 301 deaths and 1839 cases of simple fatty liver disease

The analysis revealed that after taking into account factors such as body mass index alcohol consumption and smoking status those who drank any amount of coffee and of any sort had a 20 lower risk of developing chronic liver disease or fatty liver disease taken together than those who did not consume the brew

The coffee drinkers also had a 49 lower risk of dying from chronic liver disease

Chronic liver disease is a major health problem around the world According to the British Liver Trust liver disease is the third leading cause of premature death in the UK with deaths having risen 400 since 1970

Vanessa Hebditch of the britishlivertrust said the research added to a growing body of evidence that coffee was good for liver health

But she stressed the importance of not just drinking coffee to improve their liver health but also cutting down on alcohol and keeping to a healthy weight by exercising and eating well

Does this make you want to drink coffee more

The Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to jail people who refuse to be vaccinated against coronavirus as the country battles one of Asias worst outbreaks with a cumulative total of more than 13 million cases and 23000 deaths

You choose vaccine or I will have you jailed Duterte said in a televised address on Monday following reports of low turnouts at several vaccination sites in the capital Manila

His remarks contradict those of his health officials who have said that while people are being urged to receive the Covid19 vaccine it is voluntary Duterte who has been criticised for his tough approach to containing the virus also stood by his decision not to let schools reopen

In the same address Duterte took a swipe at the international criminal court  the worlds only permanent war crimes court  after an ICC prosecutor had sought permission from the court for a full inquiry into the drug war killings in the Philippines

Duterte who in March 2018 cancelled the Philippines membership of the ICCs founding treaty repeated he would not cooperate with the investigation into allegations that police unlawfully killed as many as tens of thousands of civilians between 2016 and 2019

Why would I defend or face an accusation before white people You must be crazy Duterte said who after winning the presidency five years ago unleashed an antinarcotics campaign that has killed thousands Human rights groups say authorities have summarily executed drug suspects but Duterte maintained those who were killed violently resisted arrest

Bumble says it has quite an unconventional office environment employees have a free choice over the hours they work as long as the work gets done  and their headquarters in Texas has a Mommy Bar which is described as a private lactation space by Ms Wolfe Herd as well as fortnightly manicures hair trims and blowouts

Have you experienced burnout And if so do you think one week is enough to recover

A Utah junior high school has been criticised for taking two official photos of its cheerleading squad one which did not include the 14yearold teams manager with Down syndrome and chose to use that image in its yearbook and on social media

Shoreline junior high school cheer squad member Morgyn Arnold was seated in the front row in the first photo whereas in the second image she was absent

According to reports from the Salt Lake Tribune and the New York Times Arnolds older sister Jordyn Poll said Morgyn was crestfallen when she looked through the yearbook Arnolds name also wasnt included Poll reportedly said she thought this decision was because of her siblings disability

While some on social media questioned the other cheerleaders Arnolds family urged people to stop shaming bullying and threats targeting them pointing out that they did not have any role in selecting this photo Those girls are nothing less than amazing Poll remarked They love Morgyn They have done everything to help her and make her feel included They have feelings too

A school district spokesperson said in a statement We are deeply saddened by the mistake that was made We are continuing to look at what has occurred and why it occurred

This is the elephant in the room  literally

Ratchadawan Puengprasoppon was awoken in the early hours of Saturday morning by crashing and banging in her house in Thailand

She discovered an elephants head poking through her kitchen wall beside the drying rack

The male elephant named Boonchuay was rummaging through the kitchen drawers knocking pans to the floor

This isnt uncommon They come to visit quite often They always come when there is the local market because they can smell food said Itthipon Thaimonkol the parks superintendent

Dr Joshua Plotnik an assistant professor of psychology at Hunter College City University of New York who studies the elephant population in the Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand said In the villages in which I work in Thailand elephants enter farmers cropfields almost nightly This is a really difficult issue for both the farmers and the elephants

In China recently there was the story of a herd of elephants that travelled for 15 months far away from their natural habitat eating entire fields of corn and destroying barns along the way

These incidences are increasing in Asia and it is likely due to a decrease in available resources and an increase in human disturbances in the elephants habitat said Plotnik

If you dont fulfil the elephants need for food water and other resources in their natural habitat or ensure they have them somewhere else they will find ways around deterrents and access villages or cropfields in search of these resources

New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard is set to make history and headlines plus attract a considerable amount of controversy after being confirmed as the first transgender athlete to ever compete at the Olympic Games

The 43yearold will be a possible medal contender when she competes in the womens super heavyweight category on 2 August

But Hubbards inclusion will also frustrate those who believe she has an unfair advantage over her rivals having gone through male puberty before transitioning in 2012 which may offer advantages in power and strength to athletes even after taking medication to suppress their testosterone levels

The New Zealand Olympic Committee chief executive Kereyn Smith said Hubbard would be welcomed to the New Zealand team

As well as being among the worlds best for her event Laurel has met the IWF eligibility criteria including those based on IOC guidelines for transgender athletes she said We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play

As the New Zealand team we have a strong culture of manaaki respect and inclusion and respect for all

Activists placed 500 red roses on Copacabana Beach commemorating the victims of the pandemic and in protest against the governments response

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who downplayed the pandemic and resisted containment measures is being investigated by a congressional inquiry as his administration has lagged behind in getting hold of vaccines but pushed the use of ineffective drugs such as chloroquine

At the head of the republic there is a president who violated all sanitary norms from the beginning of the pandemic He underestimated the lethal power of the virus participated in antidemocratic public demonstrations stimulating the agglomeration said Antonio Carlos Costa the president of NGO Rio de Paz who organised the roses

Unlike Bolsonaros supporters who have taken to the streets in demonstrations over the past year antiBolsonaro protesters have refrained from gathering and preferred banging pots from their homes However as the death toll keeps averaging 2000 a day the public outcry has increased

Octopuses and lobsters have feelings and should be included in the animal sentience bill

That is the argument put forward by a group of Conservative MPs who are part of the influential Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation

The animal sentience bill now at second reading stage in the House of Lords recognises that fish and other vertebrates feel pain and should be protected where possible from suffering However the group of MPs has argued that some invertebrates are extremely intelligent and should be included in the bill

A new report by the CAWF has found that the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million cephalopods and crustaceans each year This is a total of 73600 tonnes of crustaceans and 12100 tonnes of cephalopods

It is well known that octopuses are intelligent and they have been found to be excellent at solving puzzles The Netflix film My Octopus Teacher released last year brought the issue to a large audience as hundreds of thousands of people were charmed by the relationship between human and inquisitive octopus

The new animal sentience legislation will mean that any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy This will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field

A dark day for LGBTI rights and for Hungary

Hungarys parliament has passed a law banning gay people from featuring in school educational materials or TV shows for under18s as the countrys ruling party intensified its campaign against gay rights

The Hungarian legislation outlaws sharing information with under18s that the government considers to be promoting homosexuality or gender change

Companies and large organisations will also be banned from running adverts in solidarity with gay people if they are deemed to target under18s

The law means that TV shows and films featuring gay characters or even a rainbow flag would be permitted only after the watershed

The national assembly passed the legislation by 157 votes to one despite a boycott of the vote by some opposition politicians

The outcome was never in doubt as the ruling Fidesz party led by prime minister Viktor Orbn has a healthy majority and were supported by the farright Jobbik party

The measures have been likened by critics to Russias 2013 law against gay propaganda that independent monitors say has increased social hostility and fuelled vigilante attacks against lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people in the EU countrys eastern neighbour

Amnesty Internationals Hungarian chapter which has spearheaded protests against the plans described the passing of the law as a dark day for LGBTI rights and for Hungary
This is the first time a valuable chemical has been brewed from waste plastic

Plastic bottles have been converted into vanilla flavouring using genetically engineered bacteria

The research published in the journal Green Chemistry used engineered E coli bacteria to transform terephthalic acid TA into vanillin

The scientists warmed a microbial broth to 37C for a day the same conditions as for brewing beer This converted 79 of the TA into vanillin

Vanillin is used widely in the food and cosmetics industries and is an important bulk chemical used to make pharmaceuticals cleaning products and herbicides

Global demand is growing and in 2018 was 37000 tonnes far exceeding the supply from natural vanilla beans About 85 of vanillin is currently synthesised from chemicals derived from fossil fuels

Currently plastics lose about 95 of their value as a material after a single use Encouraging better collection and use of such waste is key to tackling the global plastic pollution problem

Upcycling plastic bottles into more lucrative materials could make the recycling process far more attractive and effective

About 1m plastic bottles are sold every minute around the world and just 14 are recycled Currently even those bottles that are recycled can only be turned into opaque fibres for clothing or carpets

But what about yellow 

To encourage better respect towards peoples boundaries US event organizers are using colored accessories to help people communicate their comfort around physical touch

As coronavirus restrictions continue to be lifted many people have become less comfortable with physical acts of socializing  hugs handshakes and everything in between

While some are excited to begin upcloseandpersonal socializing others are fiercely protective of their physical space

Hence the creation of the colorcoded accessories sometimes stickers lanyards or bracelets to differentiate who is comfortable with what kind of touch

Hosts of an event in Virginia handed out red yellow and green stickers to attendees explaining that red means no physical contact wanted yellow stickers are only OK with elbow contact and green means that hugs are welcome

Amnesty International has collected new evidence of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region of China which it says has become a dystopian hellscape for hundreds of thousands of Muslims subjected to mass internment and torture

The human rights organisation has collected more than 50 new accounts from Uyghurs Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities who claim to have been subjected to mass internment and torture in police stations and camps in the region

Amnesty is calling for all camps housing Muslim and ethnic minorities across Xinjiang province to be closed and for the UN to investigate and bring those suspected of crimes under international law to account

China has consistently denied all accusations of wrongdoing in Xinjiang and said the camps were designed to offer Chinese language lessons and job support as well as to combat religious extremism

The report from Amnesty adds mounting pressure on Chinese authorities and comes after British MPs passed a motion in April that declared China is committing genocide against the Uyghur people and other minorities in Xinjiang

What responsibility do you think the producers of takeaway packaging have

The most comprehensive study ever done has found plastic items from our takeaway food and drink are the most widespread items polluting the seas

Singleuse bags plastic bottles food containers and food wrappers are the four most predominant items contaminating the ocean making up almost half of the humanmade waste the researchers found

Just 10 plastic products make up 75 of all ocean litter This includes fishing gear synthetic rope industrial packaging plastic lids drinks cans and glass bottles

The scientists said identifying the key sources of ocean plastic made it clear where action was needed They called for bans on some common throwaway items and for producers to be made to take more responsibility

Action on plastic straws and cotton buds in Europe was welcome the researchers said but risked being a distraction from tackling far more common types of litter

We were not surprised about plastic being 80 of the litter but the high proportion of takeaway items did surprise us which will not just be McDonalds litter but water bottles beverage bottles like CocaCola and cans said Carmen MoralesCaselles at the University of Cdiz Spain who led the new research

The Texas Republican congressman Louie Gohmert has asked a senior US government official if changing the moons orbit around the Earth or the Earths orbit around the sun might be a solution to tackle the climate crisis

Bizarrely the question was not posed to anyone from Nasa or even the Pentagon Instead it was asked of a senior forestry service official during a House natural resources committee hearing on Tuesday

Speaking with Jennifer Eberlien associate deputy chief of the US Forest Service Gohmert asked if it was possible to alter the orbits of the moon or the Earth as a way of combating climate change

I understand from whats been testified to the Forest Service and the BLM Bureau of Land Management you want very much to work on the issue of climate change Gohmert said adding that a past director of Nasa had once told him that orbits of the moon and the Earth were indeed changing

We know theres been significant solar flare activity and so  is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM can do to change the course of the moons orbit or the Earths orbit around the sun Gohmert asked Obviously that would have profound effects on our climate

Eberlien said she would have to follow up with you on that one Mr Gohmert

Though he seemed to be entirely earnest some observers have posited that Gohmert was seeking to express a belief that climate change was a phenomenon of natural changes in the orbits of celestial bodies and so any other efforts to address it would be futile

Maddie Groves has pulled out of the Australian Olympic swimming trials just days before the event begins saying her lastminute withdrawal should be a lesson to all misogynistic perverts in sport

Groves who won two silver medals at the Rio Games five years ago announced her decision not to compete in a social media post on Wednesday night

In a separate message posted on Thursday for emphasis and to make them pervs quake in fear from the number of people supporting a statement that threatens their existence she made allegations about her treatment by an unnamed individual involved in the sport

Last year the 26yearold alleged a person she worked with had made her feel uncomfortable by the way they looked at her in her swimming suit Groves who has endometriosis and adenomyosis has also claimed she was body shamed and told that she did not deserve more help following two surgeries

Swimming Australia has said it takes sexual misconduct allegations seriously and added that had contacted Groves about her initial allegations made last year but that she had declined to provide further information and that it had no record of any previous complaints

We consider the welfare safety and wellbeing of children and young people as paramount and we have a duty to make inquiries to uphold the standards of our sport the governing body said

Following her decision to pull out of the running for this years Olympics Groves said she intended to return to competitive swimming after the Tokyo Games

Have you heard of a raccoon dog

If youre in the UK it might not be that long before you see one

An exotic member of the fox family that is native to Japan China and Siberia raccoon dogs are one of the most destructive invasive species at risk of becoming established in Britain experts say

A horizon scanning study funded by the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs identified the raccoon dog and the raccoon as the only mammals on a list of 20 invasive species likely to reach UK shores and destroy native wildlife or bring disease

The animal was introduced into the old Soviet Union in the mid20th century and historically farmed for fur They escaped and have spread rapidly through continental Europe in recent years

According to the Mammal Society which is calling on people to report any sightings of the animals the omnivorous species could pose a threat to rare native species including amphibians small mammals and groundnesting birds Raccoon dogs can also transmit a number of diseases to humans experts say

Dr Stephanie Wray the chair of the Mammal Society said We need to be mindful of their potential impact on our native species and report any such sightings as soon as possible You only have to look at the decimation of water vole numbers which were already struggling with habitat loss before predation by invasive American mink to see the damage which can be done over a relatively short period of time

These two little girls  Tharnicaa three and her older sister Kopika five  have become emblematic for the ills of Australias refugee system

They were both born in Australia but after their mother Priya and father Nades visas had expired in 2018 they were taken from their Queensland home and put into immigration detention

Only allowed half an hour outside a day in the early months of detention Tharnicaa and Kopika became vitamin D deficient and prone to repeated infections Tharnicaa was two when her teeth were so rotten she needed surgery to have two of them removed

Since late 2019 their family has been held on Christmas Island while they challenged the Australian governments attempt to send them to Sri Lanka The Island formerly housed thousands of refugees and asylum seekers who were held there after successive Australian governments declared that nobody who arrived by boat including refugees fleeing persecution would be allowed to settle in Australia The detention centre closed in 2018 but it was reopened the following year

Last month Tharnicaa began suffering fever vomiting diarrhoea and dizziness  and on Monday she was evacuated to Perth for emergency medical care It was more than two weeks after her mother Priya Nadasalingam first alerted doctors that her daughter was unwell

The Department of Home Affairs has strongly denied any inaction in its care of Tharnicaa saying she was monitored daily and this was consistent with medical advice

She was the unanimous choice of the FAs board to succeed Greg Clarke who resigned after making racially offensive remarks in front of a parliamentary committee last November

She will take charge of English footballs governing body at one of the most precarious financial moments in its history The FA has projected estimated financial losses from Covid19 to reach 300m by 2024 and has laid off 124 members of staff

The consequences of the failed European Super League have also caused disruptions across the game and the government is conducting a review into the governance of football in England which could lead to the introduction of an independent regulator

What is a Peequal you ask Swipe to the second slide and youll see for yourself

Its a new boatshaped urinal where six women can pee at once in a circular configuration  and is being billed as the solution for all the women suffering through long waits for public toilets

Designers and recent Bristol University graduates Amber Probyn and Hazel McShane came up with the idea while they were at a music festival

According to their research women queue up to 34 times longer than men because there are around 10 male urinals for every womens public toilet

The flatpack toilets are made from 100 recycled material and can be fully recycled  and its a handsfree arrangement that the designers call a pedestal Its designed like a boat to minimise splashback says McShane and also to have a little place for your clothing in front

The Peequal is private from the waist down so your top half is still visible above the partition

Rupert Everett died in 2019 aged 74 without an apology from the UK government for their repeated errors that caused him to be wrongly classified as an illegal immigrant and threatened with arrest prison and forcible removal the parliamentary ombudsman has found

Everetts daughters said he was distressed to have his passport confiscated by immigration officials in 2016 and was terrified at the prospect of being forcibly returned to Jamaica a country he had visited only twice since leaving in 1962 aged 19

The latest critical official report on the Home Offices handling of the Windrush scandal detailed how Everett a former HGV driver who lived in the UK for more than 50 years died without having received an apology or compensation from the government

Ombudsman Rob Behrens who was asked to investigate the case after attempts to complain through the official complaints mechanism failed said A wellloved father and grandfather spent the last years of his life in severe depression and anxiety because he was being wrongfully pursued and threatened by Immigration Enforcement

Everetts daughter Fiona said her father became withdrawn and isolated after the Home Office told him he was an immigration offender We havent had an explanation or an apology It wasnt one person that messed up it was five departments she said

Sukhdeep Singh caseworker at the Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit who has helped more than 40 Windrush victims said this was one of the worst cases he had encountered because Everett had clear documentary proof of his right to be in the UK but officials ignored the evidence

A Home Office spokesperson said The victims of the Windrush scandal faced appalling treatment and we are determined to right these wrongs We are considering the ombudsmans findings and offer our sincere condolences to Mr Everetts loved ones for their loss

Our closest relatives the great apes are predicted to lose a devastating 90 of their homelands in Africa over the next 30 years according to a new study

All gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos are already endangered or critically endangered But a combination of the climate crisis the destruction of wild areas for minerals timber and food and human population growth is on track to decimate their ranges by 2050 the scientists said

The study analysed data from the International Union for Conservation of Natures apes database on species populations threats and conservation action at hundreds of sites over 20 years It then modelled the combined future impacts of global heating habitat destruction and human population growth

If we add climate change to the current causes of territory loss the picture looks devastating said Joana Carvalho a biologist and computer modeller at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and who led the study

Some new areas will become climatically suitable for the apes but the researchers doubt they will be able to migrate into these regions in time

The biggest protection for great apes could come from consumers in rich nations demanding sustainably produced goods Currently the export of minerals for mobile phones timber and palm oil are major drivers of great ape population falls

I know what it is like to shoot without an intimacy director The messy embarrassing feeling for the crew The internal devastation for the actor 

Michaela Coel and her hit drama I May Destroy You won big at the 2021 television Baftas last night with Coel dedicating her best actress award to the series intimacy coordinator Ita OBrien

Accepting awards for a show that dealt with sexual abuse and consent Coel said film and television sets were vulnerable places for actors and crew members Not to have intimacy experts was thoughtless and showed a lack of mindfulness she added

I May Destroy You was one of the cultural events of 2020 in any genre The series was inspired by Coels own experience of sexual assault by strangers after her drink was spiked It is about the aftermath of a rape and is often called a a sexual consent drama but it is also a story of fun friendship and more

In 2019 our video team spent time with Ita exploring the issue of staged sex particularly in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations and the broader MeToo movement

Its the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre that is believed to have left thousands of Chinese prodemocracy protesters dead and for the first time in decades Hong Kongs Victoria Park is almost silent

Thousands of police were deployed on Friday to enforce a ban on the citys traditional candlelight vigil which has drawn huge crowds to the park on 4 June for more than thirty years The day has traditionally served as a display of prodemocracy people power that China has made clear it will no longer tolerate

Authorities banned this years gathering citing the coronavirus pandemic  although Hong Kong has not recorded an untraceable local transmission in more than a month and held large public events Police have also cited the national security law in warning people not to gather for unnamed events and reminded the public of the recent convictions of some activists

Police say that thousands of officers will be on standby to halt any unlawful assemblies while officials have also warned that a sweeping new national security law could be wielded against Tiananmen mourners

While last years vigil was also denied permission because of the pandemic thousands simply defied the ban

But much has changed in Hong Kong over the last year as authorities seek to snuff out the citys prodemocracy movement using the security law to criminalise much dissent 

Veteran political journalist Ching Cheong who was jailed in China for three years said the perseverance of Hong Kong in holding the vigil had made it the conscience of China

Its very sad to see that starting last year authorities have tried to stamp out memorial activity purely for the selfish sake of the CCP to cling to power Ching said

I dont think marking the anniversary of the crackdown itself will lead to the collapse of the communist regime but its evident proof the regime is extremely afraid of people knowing the atrocities that it has committed

How did you feel when Colstons statue was toppled

This is the question written above the sculpture in a museum in Bristol

The defaced bronze memorial to the 17thcentury slave trader had stood in the city since 1895 but was pulled from its plinth during Black Lives Matter demonstrations on 7 June last year

It was dragged through the city to the harbourside where it was thrown in the water at Peros Bridge which is named in honour of Pero Jones an enslaved man who lived and died in the city

On Friday almost exactly a year since it was toppled the bronze will go on public display at the M Shed museum alongside placards from the protest and a timeline of events

The statue featuring graffiti and damage from when it was pulled down is displayed lying on a wooden stand

The public are being asked what should happen to it next

Options include removing the statue from public view entirely creating a museum or exhibition about the transatlantic slave trade or restoring the statue to its plinth

The ships operators said in a statement yesterday that there were no signs oil had leaked from the ship However burned debris and microplastics have washed up along Sri Lankan shores requiring the navy to conduct a cleanup operation

Is 70 the new 50

This 71yearold model thinks so Sarah Grant donned a swimsuit to make her Australian fashion week runway debut on Thursday

Its great for older women to see a more mature person wearing an outfit because then they can relate to it and its good for business because baby boomers are one of the largest demographics when it comes to buying fashion Grant says

Grant may be new to Australian fashion week but she is a veteran of international modelling Her first catwalk appearance was for Pierre Cardin in New Zealand at the age of 16

Valentino Karl Lagerfeld and Zandra Rhodes were among the brands she walked for in Paris Milan and London before returning to Australia where she appeared on the cover of Playboy with an electric guitar in the 70s

Grant says the modelling industry has changed immensely since she got her first big break in the 60s We were all just regular sizes  a size 10 or size 12  so there wasnt that pressure to be slim When the super skinny look came in it was really tragic for the business and a lot of girls ended up with issues because of it

2021 vs 1921 the Tulsa race massacre took place 100 years ago this week and still stands as one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history

Between 31 May1 June 1921 white residents peace officers and soldiers attacked the Greenwood district of Tulsa Oklahoma one of the wealthiest Black communities in the US An an estimated 300 people died  mostly Black people  displacing upwards of 1000 and inflicting irrevocable economic damage to a thriving business district created by and for Black Americans

Its believed to have been the first time that bombs were dropped on an American community and the actions undertaken by the white citizens who received significant resistance from both everyday Black civilians and Black soldiers recently returned from the first world war wasnt taught in Oklahoma school books and barely mentioned in national textbooks for generations afterwards

In the images above artist and filmmaker Bayet Ross Smith bayetekenan allows us to revisit the scene of the atrocity by overlaying photos from 1921 over presentday Tulsa They help us to place the massacre more concretely but also serve as a reminder that the past is very rarely past at all despite Americas efforts to forget it

What exactly is racenorming

Its a practice developed in medicine and adopted by the NFL when settling concussion lawsuits that assumed Black players had a lower level of cognitive function

The American football league has now pledged to stop using the racebased formula when assessing payouts in its 1 billion settlement of brain injury claims  and also promised to review previous brain injury claims that have been settled through racenorming

The decision comes after a pair of Black players filed a civil rights lawsuit over the practice which began in the 1990s

The standards were created in hopes of offering more appropriate treatment to dementia patients but critics faulted the way the NFL used them to assess legal damages saying it was harder for Black American football players to show a deficit and qualify for an award

More than 2000 NFL retirees have filed dementia claims but fewer than 600 have received awards according to the most recent report More than half of all NFL retirees are Black according to lawyers involved in the litigation

The NFL noted that the norms were developed in medicine to stop bias in testing not perpetrate it and added the practice was never mandatory but left to the discretion of doctors taking part in the settlement program

From county officials and sheriffs to governors and senators white male minority rule pervades politics in the United States according to a new report shared exclusively with guardianus

White men represent 30 of the population but 62 of officeholders dominating both chambers of Congress 42 state legislatures and statewide roles across the nation the analysis shows

By contrast women and people of colour constitute 51 and 40 of the US population respectively but just 31 and 13 of officeholders according to the research by the Reflective Democracy Campaign

I think if we saw these numbers in another country we would say there is something very wrong with that political system said Brenda Choresi Carter the campaigns director

We would say how could that possibly be a democratic system with that kind of demographic mismatch

Two factors perpetuate white male control over virtually every lever of US government the huge advantage enjoyed by incumbents and the Republican partys continued focus on mostly white male candidates

As the US barrels toward a minoritywhite population within a matter of decades some believe elected officials will inevitably become more diverse But that logic is flawed women have always been half of the country and they are still chronically underrepresented in government

Meanwhile politicians who currently hold office can make election laws and draw districts in their favour This legislative cycle Republican state lawmakers have devised a barrage of new voter restrictions that have targeted leftleaning communities vulnerable voters and people of colour

That was Kate Winslets response when a director suggested possibly editing a sex scene in which she showed a bulgy bit of belly for her latest television series

The actor claimed Craig Zobel the director of her new HBO series Mare of Easttown had offered to show her body in a more flattering light

Winslet who plays detective and a grandmother Mare Sheehan in a Pennsylvania town in the new programme said she had refused  adding that she twice sent back the promotional poster for the drama because she felt it had been altered too much

Im like Guys I know how many lines I have by the side of my eye please put them all back Winslet 45 told the New York Times

The Queens courtiers banned coloured immigrants or foreigners from serving in clerical roles in the royal household until at least the late 1960s according to newly discovered documents that will reignite the debate over the British royal family and race

Just a few months after Prince William said the royal family is very much not racist a Guardian exclusive reveals how Buckingham Palace negotiated controversial clauses  that remain in place to this day  exempting the Queen and her household from laws that prevent race and sex discrimination

The papers were discovered at the National Archives as part of the Guardians ongoing investigation into the royal familys use of an arcane parliamentary procedure known as Queens consent to secretly influence the content of British laws

They reveal how in 1968 the Queens chief financial manager informed civil servants that it was not in fact the practice to appoint coloured immigrants or foreigners to clerical roles in the royal household although they were permitted to work as domestic servants

It is unclear when the practice ended Buckingham Palace refused to answer questions about the ban and when it was revoked It said its records showed people from ethnic minority backgrounds being employed in the 1990s It added that before that decade it did not keep records on the racial backgrounds of employees

A herd of 15 elephants escaped from a nature reserve in southwestern China in April  and since then they have left a trail of destruction including eating whole fields of corn and smashing up barns

It was unclear why the wild Asian elephants a protected species in the country strayed from the Xishuangbanna national nature reserve in Yunnan province

But since midApril the animals have embarked on a 500km journey closely monitored by residents and authorities with hundreds of people mobilised to ensure public safety

On Tuesday authorities in Yunnan said the herd was 20km from the provincial capital of Kunming home to millions of people

In the last few weeks the elephants have wrecked around 56 hectares of crops causing an estimated 107m in losses so far state broadcaster CCTV said

No casualties have been reported so far with locals attempting to guide the animals with food and by blocking roads with trucks

If Solomon Islands continues logging at its current rate natural forests in the country will be exhausted in 15 years the Ministry of Finance has said

The South Pacific nation is a striking example of the enormous cost of the logging industry While it has been a source of revenue for the country and employment for its people logging has erased significant portions of its forestry and resulted in environmental hazards for local communities

In the last few decades foreignowned companies have moved into the Pacific region clearing huge swathes of lush forest exporting vast quantities of timber and sometimes leaving environmental devastation and social destruction in their wake

Do you think this is the best system

After months of deliberations the World Health Organization has announced Covid19 variants are to be named after letters of the Greek alphabet instead of their place of first discovery which is stigmatising and discriminatory

The WHO has named four variants of concern known to the public as the UKKent B117 South Africa B1351 Brazil P1 and India B16172 variants They will now be given the letters Alpha Beta Gamma and Delta respectively to reflect their order of detection with any new variants following the pattern down the Greek alphabet

Historically diseases have frequently been named after the locations they were thought to have developed such as the Ebola virus which takes its name from the Congolese river However such associations can be damaging for those places and are often inaccurate as is the case with the Spanish flu of 1918 whose origins are unknown

Earlier this month the Indian government ordered social media platforms to take down content that referred to the Indian variant The government order was cited as an example of its sensitivity to accusations that it had mishandled the latest outbreak

AntiAsian hate crime has risen as a result of the pandemic and associations between Covid and the site of its first outbreak in Wuhan China US antiextremist groups said a rise in attacks on AsianAmericans was partly down to Donald Trump who referred to Covid19 as the China virus

The WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said of adopting new variant names No country should be stigmatised for detecting and reporting variants
New Zealands rare highly endangered alpine parrots may have headed for the mountains to avoid people

The kea  an alpine parrot  is thought to be the only parrot to live in the mountains but scientists analysing DNA sequencing and fossil records have found the species were once present in other parts of the country

The news is something of a knock to the keas internationally unique alpine parrot status But it may also be a saving grace for the endangered bird making it more capable of surviving habitat loss or increased competition

Being an alpine specialist can make species like kea particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis Research from Europe has found up to 22 of species studied on glaciers in the Italian Alps would disappear from the area once the glaciers had gone

Associate professor Michael Knapp one of the papers lead authors said the idea that kea had moved specifically to avoid people was still speculative But given kea were physically able to survive in a variety of habitats it made sense to examine what the primary differences were

Athletes and other public figures have spoken out in support of Naomi Osaka after she announced her withdrawal from the French Open in order to preserve her mental health

The world number two withdrew from the grand slam tournament a day after they fined her 15000 for not speaking with the press

Osaka 23 who won her first match against Patricia Maria Tig and was scheduled to face Ana Bogdan in the second round had released a statement last Wednesday stating her intention to skip her media obligations during the event because of the effects of her interactions with the press on her mental health

In her withdrawal statement the fourtimes grand slam champion said she has suffered from long bouts of depression since the 2018 US Open final

Anyone that knows me knows Im introverted and anyone that has seen me at the tournaments will notice that Im often wearing headphones as that helps dull my social anxiety Osaka wrote

Osaka concluded her statement by saying she suffers huge waves of anxiety before speaking with the media So here in Paris I was already feeling vulnerable and anxious so I thought it was better to exercise selfcare and skip the press conferences I announced it preemptively because I do feel like the rules are quite outdated in parts and I wanted to highlight that

An amazing decision

The Australian environment minister has a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis thats according to the countrys federal court

The judgment has been hailed by lawyers and teenagers who brought the case as a world first

Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun had sought an injunction to prevent the environment minister Sussan Ley approving a proposal to expand a coal mine in New South Wales arguing she had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change

The judge Justice Mordecai Bromberg found the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people But he did not grant the injunction as he was not satisfied the minister would breach her duty of care

David Barnden a lawyer representing the children said it was a historic and amazing decision with potentially significant consequences

The court has found that the minister owes a duty of care to younger children to vulnerable people and that duty says that the minister must not act in a way that causes harm  future harm  from climate change to younger people he said outside court It is the first time in the world that such a duty of care has been recognised especially in a common law country

This is what a super blood moon looks like

What actually is that Well its what you get if you combine a total lunar eclipse and a supermoon

It was visible across most of Australia southeast Asia and the Americas on Wednesday

A total lunar eclipse also known as a blood moon happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon and the moon is fully in the Earths shadow

A supermoon such as last months pink moon a more common phenomenon takes place when the full moon occurs near the closest point in its orbit to Earth

The footprint per airship passenger would be about 45kg compared to 53kg if that person was traveling via a jet plane 

Thats according to Hybrid Air Vehicles HAV who have developed a new environmentally friendly airship 84 years after the Hindenburg disaster

The 100passenger Airlander 10 airship can apparently take off and land from almost any flat surface and reached heights of 7000ft 2100m and speeds of up to 50 knots 57mph during its final tests

HAV said it is in discussions with a number of airlines to operate a string of routes it will serve from 2025 These include Liverpool to Belfast which would take five hours and 20 minutes Oslo to Stockholm in six and a half hours and Seattle to Vancouver in just over four hours

The journey by airship would take roughly the same time as aeroplane travel once getting to and from the airport was taken into account but would generate a much smaller carbon footprint

Living in a van can represent so many different things these days

For some it is their culture heritage and way of life For others its a philosophy and a symbol of resistance

And then there are those who just dont have any other choice

In recent years the number of homeless people living in vehicles has doubled as conventional homes become increasingly unaffordable

And now the proposed police crime sentencing and courts act will create a new offence of residing on land without consent in or with a vehicle and will make it easier for the police to remove unauthorised encampments on highways

The police killing of George Floyd one year ago today was a tragedy America had seen many times before But what followed was like nothing it had experienced in recent history and went far beyond the US

The global protest movement that marched in Floyds name and Breonna Taylors name and Adama Traors name and all Black victims of police was unprecedented and inarguably changed the world

But change is one thing  what about progress What about accountability equality and justice Has the world actually listened and made enough meaningful changes in the last year

A guardianaustralia investigation on endangered species has found that Scott Morrisons Coalition government tried to stop the publication of an academic paper that said it needed to drastically increase its spending to support threatened Australian wildlife

Internal documents released to our team under freedom of information laws revealed that a briefing note prepared for a meeting with governmentfunded scientists suggested they dont publish the paper which was being drafted in 2019 and compared Australian funding to recover endangered wildlife with that in the US 

Another option considered was publishing the paper known as the Spending to Save paper under a different set of author names  something that could have qualified as academic misconduct

After our story was published online the environment department said in a statement on Friday that We strongly reject any assertion that department officials sought to pressure researchers in relation to the nonpublication or authorship of the paper

Don Driscoll a professor at Deakin University who led a recent study that surveyed Australian scientists about pressures they face to change or not release their work said the internal documents revealed a disgraceful example of scientific suppression

Its really worrying because the public service is trying to hide important information about the state of our biodiversity from the public Driscoll a professor at Deakin University added 

The public needs to know why our biodiversity is under threat They need to know its being enormously underfunded

Prince William has slammed BBC failures over the 1995 Martin Bashir Panorama interview with his mother Diana Princess of Wales

Following an inquiry into the 1995 broadcast the Duke of Cambridge said the programme had established a false narrative and that the deceitful way the interview was obtained had substantially influenced what his mother had said

Prince Harry the Duke of Sussex also released a statement commenting on the outcome of the investigation saying Our mother was an incredible woman who dedicated her life to service She was resilient brave and unquestionably honest The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her life

The investigation conducted by the former supreme court judge John Dyson found that Bashir had engaged in deceitful behaviour by commissioning fake bank statements to land the interview

The BBCs current director general Tim Davie said the corporation accepted the report in full

Adding that Although the report states that Diana Princess of Wales was keen on the idea of an interview with the BBC it is clear that the process for securing the interview fell far short of what audiences have a right to expect

In 1918 when the great flu pandemic swept through India and killed an estimated 18 million people the water of this river  upon which so many lives depended  was filled with the stench of death

And so it is again

Indias official death toll from the coronavirus pandemic may be just over a quarter of a million but experts believe the real figure to be up to five times higher

Now the bodies that have begun washing up in Indias holiest river have become haunting representations of the uncounted Covid dead

What a difference a day makes

On Tuesday the Texas governor Greg Abbott banned public schools and local governments from requiring people to wear masks on the grounds that Texans should have the freedom to make their own health decisions

The Covid death toll in Texas currently stands at 50000 with the CDC still recommending masks to protect those who are yet to be vaccinated

On Wednesday Abbott then signed into law one of the strictest abortion bans in recent US history If it comes into force in September it would outlaw abortions after roughly six weeks with no exceptions for rape or incest

Although Abbott referred to the ban as saving children a pregnancy is in fact an embryo at this stage and cannot survive outside the womb for roughly another 18 weeks

Prochoice groups planning to fight the law have described it as clearly unconstitutional Abortion is legal in all 50 US states including Texas because Roe v Wade  the landmark decision in the US Supreme Court  protects a womans right to choose

As many have pointed out the restriction is effectively a total ban as many women dont know theyre pregnant until after six weeks which means they would have virtually no choice under the new law to make their own health decisions

Children are bearing the brunt of this escalation

In Gaza a tiny coastal territory enclosed by walls and fences there is no escape from the terrifying sound of explosions and the fear that any moment could be your last

For children in their early teens this is the fourth war they have lived through  and been traumatised by

All those under the age of 13 have gone their whole life under an Israeli blockade with restrictions on movement naval warships patrolling the seas and military aircraft and surveillance drones in the skies above

And in the now 11dayold conflict between the Israel armed forces and militants in Gaza at least 63 Palestinian children have been killed and hundreds injured according to health officials inside the enclave

In one incident eight children from one extended family were killed as they were sleeping in an airstrike on the densely populated Shati refugee camp

The Israeli military said it had targeted officials from Hamas the Islamist faction that seized control of Gaza in 2007

The scale of violence is massive said Unicef the UN childrens agency at the weekend Children are bearing the brunt of this escalation

Young people in Israel are victims too Two children have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza in the latest fighting and over the years thousands have also been traumatised by air raid sirens explosions and evacuations to bomb shelters

A study conducted in Gaza by Unicef following the 2012 war found that 91 of children reported sleeping disturbances during the conflict 94 said they slept with their parents and 82 were either continuously or usually in fear of imminent death

These children in Gaza have also spent their entire lives under the rule of a militant group Hamas rockets often fall within its own borders sometimes causing destruction injuries and deaths Its operations and infrastructure make civilians a target

Hundreds of families have lost their homes altogether what was once a place where children played ate did their homework and slept is now a pile of rubble and twisted metal

Dog could now be used for mass coronavirus screening in crowded places after a study concluded that they are better at detecting the virus in humans than many fast lateral flow tests

The trial conducted in March and April by Frances national veterinary school and the clinical research unit of Pariss NeckerCochin hospital showed canines were able to detect the presence of the virus with 97 accuracy

Researchers collected samples cotton pads pressed for two minutes under participants armpits from 335 people aged between six and 76 who presented themselves for a PCR test at testing centres in Paris

The pads were then sealed in jars and given to at least two of the nine dogs used in the trial to be sniffed The dogs handlers did not know in advance which samples were positive

The dogs detected 97 of the 109 people whose PCR test subsequently proved positive and 91 of those whose PCR test was negative

A recent review of 64 studies found LFTs correctly identify on average 72 of people infected with the virus who have symptoms and 58 who do not

Prof JeanMarc Trluyer hailed the excellent results and the dogs quick response While they wont replace polymerase chain reaction PCR tests which are significantly more reliable than LFT tests they could help identify those people who should undergo a full viral test in places such as airports train stations and concert venues

Researchers in countries including Australia Germany and Britain have experimented with dogs to detect Covid while Finland and the United Arab Emirates last year launched trials with sniffer dogs at Helsinki and Dubai international airports
For nearly a century she was denied a voice by a culture of silence

Finally at the age of 107 Viola Fletcher got a national stage to bear witness to Americas deep history of racial violence

Fletcher is the oldest living survivor of a massacre that took place in Tulsa Oklahoma on 31 May and 1 June 1921 when a white mob attacked the citys Black Wall Street killing an estimated 300 African Americans while robbing and burning more than 1200 businesses homes and churches

She was just seven years old at the time

For decades the atrocity was actively covered up and wished away But Fletcher and her 100yearold brother are seeking reparations and ahead of the massacres centenary yesterday they appeared before a House of Representatives judiciary subcommittee considering legal remedies

I am here seeking justice Fletcher said

She recalled how the Greenwood neighbourhood of Tulsa had once been a thriving and affluent African American community but that this bright future was suddenly taken away 

I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home I still see Black men being shot Black bodies lying in the street I still smell smoke and see fire  I have lived through the massacre every day

The hearing was told that there has never been any direct compensation from the city or state for massacre survivors or their descendants and that racial disparities compounded by gentrification and urban planning persist in Tulsa today  a microcosm of America

Fletcher also asked that the country acknowledge her experience and give the survivors a chance to seek justice I believe we must acknowledge Americas sins she said It is the least we can do

Suddenly Darwins Arch in the Galpagos islands collapsed this week due to natural erosion

The rock formation was named after the British scientist Charles Darwin who visited the islands in 1835 on HMS Beagle and developed his theory of evolution by examining Galpagos finches

It was famous as a diving spot for underwater encounters with sea turtles whale sharks manta rays and dolphins

Images on the Ecuadors environment ministry Facebook page on Tuesday show just two rocky pillars left on the southeast of Darwin Island which is the northernmost island of the Pacific Ocean archipelago about 600 miles off South America

Diving website Scuba Diver Life said visitors on a diving boat had witnessed the collapse at 1120am local time on Monday adding that no divers had been harmed

The Galpagos islands declared as one of the first Unesco world heritage sites in 1978 contain flora and fauna not seen anywhere else on earth and are part of a biosphere reserve About 30000 people live on the archipelago spread across four inhabited islands

Jen Jones of the Galpagos Conservation Trust said the collapse of Darwins Arch is a reminder of how fragile our world is

Do these findings change your view of alcohol

According to a study of more than 25000 people in the UK there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption for the brain

Even moderate drinking adversely affects nearly every part of your brain the research which is yet to be peer reviewed says

Theres no threshold drinking for harm  any alcohol is worse Pretty much the whole brain seems to be affected  not just specific areas as previously thought said the lead author Anya Topiwala a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Oxford

Contrary to previous research that suggested wine in moderation could be healthier than beer or spirits the study found no evidence to suggest the type of alcohol changes the risk to the brain

In 2016 the Department of Health introduced new alcohol guidelines in the UK recommending that both men and women drink no more than 14 units of alcohol each week

Just 20 companies are responsible for producing more than half of all the singleuse plastic waste in the world new research has revealed

If you swipe across you can see a full list of these global businesses

The firms who are being blamed for fuelling the climate crisis are both stateowned and multinational corporations including oil and gas giants and chemical companies

They are behind 55 of the worlds plastic packaging waste according to the Plastic Waste Makers index who for the first time have revealed the companies who produce the polymers that become throwaway plastic items from face masks to plastic bags and bottles which at the end of their short life pollute the oceans or are burned or thrown into landfill

Just 1015 of singleuse plastic is recycled globally each year  and by 2050 plastic is expected to account for 510 of greenhouse gas emissions

The enormous plastic waste footprint of the top 20 global companies amounts to more than half of the 130m metric tonnes of singleuse plastic thrown away in 2019 the groundbreaking analysis says

But who are funding these producers

Things have at times felt hopeless for people suffering with long Covid but a large new survey has offered some good news that coronavirus vaccines tend to reduce symptoms

The analysis which is yet to be peer reviewed was based on a survey involving 812 people  mostly white female participants  with long Covid in the UK and internationally who were contacted via social media

Scores across 14 common longCovid symptoms were compared before and after the first vaccine dose Data showed that 567 of respondents experienced an overall improvement in symptoms with 246 remaining unchanged and 187 reporting a deterioration in their symptoms

In general those who received mRNA vaccines PfizerBioNTech or Moderna reported more improvements in symptoms compared with those who got an adenovirus vaccine OxfordAstraZeneca

In particular those who received the Moderna vaccine were more likely to see improvements in symptoms such as fatigue brain fog and muscle pain and less likely to report a deterioration the analysis found

Long Covid or postCovid syndrome describes a range of symptoms that persist for more than four weeks after a first suspected infection with the virus and which are not explained by other causes

The latest data published by the Office for National Statistics suggests that in the fourweek period ending 6 March an estimated 11 million people selfreported having long Covid in the UK

But there is no consensus on the prevalence of the condition  or its definition  let alone a standardised treatment plan

And there are still so many unknowns  click the link in bio to read our full article on the survey which was conducted by the advocacy group LongCovidSOS

The attack also caused damage to the nearby health ministry and prime health care clinic

There has been no sign of even a temporary truce to allow medics to recover people  alive and dead  from under collapsed buildings

Eight days of Israeli airstrikes and Hamas rocket barrages have killed more than 200 people the vast majority of them Palestinian

The latest outbreak began in East Jerusalem last month when Israeli police cracked down on Palestinian public gatherings during Ramadan and the Israeli supreme court prepared to issue a ruling  since delayed  on the threatened eviction of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers

Tensions exploded last week after Israeli police wounded hundreds of Palestinians during protests and officers in riot gear stormed alAqsa mosque  the third holiest site in Islam

Hamas the Islamist group that rules inside the strip then began firing rockets toward Jerusalem triggering the Israeli assault on Gaza

Israel says its strikes target militants Hamas has stationed its fighters in and fired rockets from civilian areas Twelve people in Israel including two children have been killed by militants who have launched more than 3000 rockets during the past week

Gaza health officials say 213 including 61 children have been killed in the same period

A group of scientists have concluded that sharks possess an internal navigation system similar to GPS that allows them to use Earths magnetic forces to travel long distances with accuracy

Researchers from Florida State University made the discovery by subjecting 20 bonnethead sharks part of the hammerhead family to magnetic displacement exercises that replicated geographical locations hundreds of miles from where they were captured

When the sharks were exposed to magnetic cues emulating a site about 375 miles south of where they were captured they turned to swim north exhibiting a homeward orientation suggesting the use of magnetic forces in their navigation said Bryan Keller the lead author of the study

The research helps explain why sharks can travel across vast oceans but return to exactly the same location annually to feed breed and give birth Keller said He and his team believe the bonnetheads onboard navigation system is probably common to other species of sharks because it is unlikely bonnetheads evolved with sensitivity to magnetic forces while others that also travel long distances did not

According to Science Magazine in 2005 a great white shark was tracked swimming from South Africa to Australia and back again in almost a straight line leading scientists to believe sharks have a magnetic sense to steer themselves similar to those found in sea birds lobsters and turtles

Until now however little research has been conducted

The fighting between Israel and militant groups in Gaza has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis the UN secretary general has said

Antnio Guterres warning came as Israeli warplanes launched what appeared to be the heaviest airstrikes yet on Gaza City

The series of attacks early on Monday rocked the city from north to south for 10 minutes and was more intense covered a broader area and lasted longer than the raids 24 hours earlier in which 42 Palestinians were killed  the deadliest single attack in the latest violence between Israel and the Hamas militant group that rules Gaza

The Israeli army spokespersons office said the strikes targeted Hamass underground military infrastructure

On Sunday airraid sirens sounded for the seventh consecutive day across southern Israel as Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza launched more rocket attacks into the country  and reaching further  than in the entirety of the 2014 war

As the UN security council met in a specially convened session foreign ministers and ambassadors called for a ceasefire and for both sides to respect international humanitarian law but there was no sign of even a temporary truce to allow medics in Gaza to recover people  alive and dead  from under collapsed buildings

At least 201 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza including 58 children according to health officials in the enclave Ten people in Israel have been killed including two children Israeli authorities say

Who owns Australia

The true answer is First Nations peoples whose ownership stems back 60000 years The legal answer is more complex

Six months ago GuardianAustralia set out to learn who owns the outback The data we received was unwieldy incomplete inconsistent and often came with a hefty price tag

The concept of land ownership in Australia is complicated There are freehold titles as well as exclusive and nonexclusive native titles They all relate to the rights of the people who own the land

The maps above show changes in Indigenousheld land over the years

Since 1965 Indigenous ownership has returned to parts of the country  after two centuries of violent dispossession through European colonisation

For mapping purposes weve defined Indigenous tenure as exclusivepossession native title and freehold as they give the right to exclude others from the land

Using this definition Indigenous tenure makes up about 26 of Australias landmass

But for Indigenous leaders like Keven Smith a Torres Strait man and chief executive of Queensland South Native Title Services the connection of traditional owners to a place is not defined by whether they are able to be granted native title

If you ask the question of who owns Australia I would say that First Nations people own this country Smith says Even though theres limited application of native title over the four corners of this nation cultural heritage is tenureblind

Campaigners have hailed a victory for Glaswegian solidarity and told the Home Office you messed with the wrong city as two men detained by UK Immigration Enforcement were released back into their community after a day of protest

Police Scotland intervened to free the men after a tense daylong standoff between immigration officials and hundreds of local residents who surrounded their van in a residential street on the southside of Glasgow to stop the detention of the men during Eid alFitr

Staff from Immigration Enforcement are believed to have swooped on a property in Pollokshields early on Thursday morning and detained people

By midmorning a crowd of about 200 protesters surrounded the vehicle preventing it from driving away and chanting Say it loud say it clear refugees are welcome here with one protester lying under the van to prevent it driving off

Im just overwhelmed by Glasgows solidarity for refugees and asylum seekers said the human rights activist Roza Salih shouting to be heard over the jubilant shouts of the crowd She added This is a victory for the community
Mostly peaceful some riotous and destructive the protests in Colombia  which kicked off at the end of April  have divided the population

Some people say they feel like they can finally speak their minds while others believe the unrest which was sparked by now cancelled tax reform proposals has gone too far during the countrys third Covid wave

At least 47 people have died and local and international human rights organisations have blamed police for the killings Dozens of disciplinary investigations have been launched and three officers have been charged with murder

The action has led to president Ivn Duque now promising a national dialogue over issues raised by young demonstrators including free university tuition But the government has dismissed out of hand some of the protesters demands such as a basic income and ignored broad calls for police reform

Animals have the ability to be aware of feelings and sensations  and in a victory for animal welfare campaigners  for the first time in UK law thats being formally acknowledged

As well as formally being recognised as sentient beings the government is setting out a number of animal welfare measures including halting most live animal exports and banning the import of hunting trophies

The reforms will be introduced through a series of bills including an animal sentience bill and will cover farm animals and pets in the UK and include protections for animals abroad through bans on ivory and shark fins and a potential ban on foie gras

The action plan for animal welfare includes measures that will involve cracking down on pet theft Controversial ecollars that deliver an electric shock to train pets will be banned and import rules changed to try to stop puppy smuggling

Some of the measures including microchipping cats and stopping people keeping primates as pets have been several years in preparation while others like the restriction of live animal exports have been the subject of decadeslong campaigns

The Covid pandemic was a preventable disaster that need not have cost millions of lives if the world had reacted more quickly according to a WHOcommissioned report

The independent highlevel panel behind the work have slammed global leaders and called for major changes to ensure something like this cannot happen again

The report of the panel chaired by Helen Clark former prime minister of New Zealand and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf former president of Liberia found weak links at every point in the chain

It said preparation was inconsistent and underfunded the alert system too slow and too meek while the World Health Organization was underpowered It concluded that the response has exacerbated inequalities Global political leadership was absent the report said

Clark described February 2020 as a month of lost opportunity to avert a pandemic as so many countries chose to wait and see

For some it wasnt until hospital ICU beds began to fill that more action was taken she said And by then it was too late to avert the pandemic impact What followed then was a winner takes all scramble for PPE and therapeutics Globally health workers were tested to their limits and the rates of infection illness and death soared and continue to soar

According to the Covid19 dashboard run by Johns Hopkins University there have been more than 160 million cases of the disease since the pandemic began last year with the official death toll reaching 3319169 today
Mori party coleader Rawiri Waititi has been thrown out of New Zealands parliament after denouncing rhetoric from the opposition as racist and performing a haka

Waititi said the opposition was inciting racism across the country through its stance on Mori healthcare  and told lawmakers in the chamber that he was forced to listen to a constant barrage of insults directed towards indigenous people

When asked to sit down by the speaker Trevor Mallard Waititi instead stepped into the centre of parliament to perform a haka and was subsequently thrown out  and accompanied by his partys coleader Debbie NgarewaPacker

The haka is a ceremonial dance for Mori the indigenous people of New Zealand and can represent a challenge and is sometimes performed in moments of conflict

This incident comes after weeks of escalating debate in which the opposition National party has accused the government of a separatist agenda and creating two systems by stealth Their arguments began after the government announced expanded independent health services for Mori who typically have far worse health outcomes than other ethnic groups

In February Waititi was ejected from the House for not wearing a tie He said he had chosen to wear cultural dress in defiance of dress code Waititi has dubbed ties a colonial noose and wore a pounamu or greenstone necklace in place of a necktie House rules were subsequently revised to remove the necktie requirement

The protesters have complained of oppressive restrictions during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan The injuries took place during nearnightly protests that ramped up over the weekend and spread to other areas of Israel and the occupied West Bank

The situation was further inflamed by a nowpostponed Israeli court ruling on whether authorities can evict dozens of Palestinians from a majorityArab Jerusalem neighbourhood and give their homes to Jewish settlers

As protests intensified militant groups in Gaza were accused of launching more than 200 rockets into Israel before Israel responded with allnight airstrikes on the Palestinian coastal territory which killed twentyfour people

A new StopESEAsianHate campaign has been launched to take action on the increasing racism against east and southeast Asian ESEA people in the UK since the start of the pandemic

Marvel film star Gemma Chan has revealed that she is frightened for her family in the UK after a surge in hate crimes against the ESEA communities

Speaking to the Observer to help raise awareness for the campaign Chan said she was deeply concerned and disturbed at police figures revealing that in London alone attacks on these individuals have tripled over the past year

Monzo the online bank has become one of the first UK companies to offer paid leave for employees who are affected by the loss of a pregnancy

The banks policy will give either partner up to 10 extra days of paid leave if they lose a baby due to abortion miscarriage or stillbirth regardless of when in the pregnancy it happens

This also includes colleagues who are partners or surrogate mothers recognising that pregnancy loss doesnt just affect women or heterosexual couples the bank said Extra leave can be approved by managers if staff feel they need more than two weeks

Under UK employment law businesses only have to allow parents to use planned maternity or paternity leave if they lose their baby after 24 weeks when it is considered a stillbirth

Any loss before that is counted as a miscarriage and does not qualify them for maternity leave or pay It is then up to the discretion of employers whether to offer compassionate leave annual leave or unpaid holiday

In the UK more than one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage resulting in roughly 250000 losses each year according to the Miscarriage Association Most occur in the first three months of pregnancy

The footage of the meeting was streamed live to the public via Ohios states broadcaster and at the start Brenner appeared in a parked car 

A few minutes later he left the call before reappearing with a different background featuring wooden cabinets hanging artwork and a houseplant

Brenner denied that he was driving unsafely He told The Columbus Dispatch he wasnt distracted during the meeting and was paying attention to the driving and listening to the discussion
It could be a gamechanger

Uganda has announced a new project using drones to deliver HIV medicines to its most remote areas

The first drone took off last week carrying medicines out to 78 community groups and health facilities across the widely scattered Ssese islands which have the highest HIV prevalence in the country

The delivery of antiretroviral drugs and healthcare is difficult weatherdependent and risky for healthcare workers as travel into the region  60 miles from the capital Kampala  is possible only by boat

The Uganda Medical Association has welcomed the drones but expressed concern over drug shortages due to inadequate funding Its secretary general Mukuzi Muhereza said We are welcoming it Its very important and it could be a gamechanger It would be nice to see whether it really works with our bad network and connectivity

Realistically I think we are not giving enough money to national medical stores to purchase drugs and supplies for every Ugandan that needs it The biggest change would be if we can enhance the budget and make sure we have what we need to send

This googlyeyed device is a scarecrow for the sea

It has been created by scientists to help reduce the number of vulnerable seabirds caught by fishing nets

Known as a loomingeyes buoy the scarecrow uses bright eyespots and looming movements to act as a natural deterrent preventing seabirds from diving into gillnets  vertical nets used in smallscale fisheries in many countries

The scientists in charge found the device to reduce the numbers of birds by a quarter within a 50metre radius of the buoy

It is hoped the device still in its prototype phase will be tested in smallscale fisheries and help save thousands of seabirds each year
What are your thoughts on these new immigration rules

Oscar winners Nobel prize recipients and Brit awardwinners are just some of the foreign nationals who will be fasttracked for UK visas under a tweak to immigration rules announced by the Home Office

An existing global talent route was introduced in 2020 which supplies visas for leader or potential leaders in academia arts and culture or digital technology This tweak streamlines the route for people who have won prestigious prizes

This is part of Home Secretary Priti Patels Australianstyle points system  a move which closes the door to lowskilled workers including those in hospitality care and agriculture

This is exactly what our new pointbased immigration system was designed for  attracting the best and brightest based on the skills and talent they have not where theyve come from Patel said

The awards cover science technology maths engineering music film acting and literature However the rules cover very specific categories within these award It is only an Oscar in a leading acting or directorial role which will be favoured and with literature only the Nobel prize is accepted

For music possible routes include a best international male or female award at the Brits best international act at the Mobo awards or a Grammy for lifetime achievement

We were born out of injustice on the streets of Manchester  and for 200 years weve been standing up to the powerful uncovering the truth and reporting on the world around us

On 16 August 1819 up to 60000 working class people from the towns and villages of what is now Greater Manchester marched to St Peters Field in central Manchester to demand political representation at a time when only wealthy landowners could vote

Their peaceful protest  now known as the Peterloo Massacre pictured above  turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered a private militia paid for by rich locals to storm the crowd with sabres An estimated 18 people died and more than 650 were injured in the chaos

This led to the establishment two years later of the Manchester Guardian by John Edward Taylor a 28yearold English journalist who was present at the massacre and saw how the establishment media sought to discredit the protesters

The numbers on coronavirus in India are getting worse

With hospitals scrabbling for beds and oxygen in response to a deadly second surge in infections the World Health Organization said in a weekly report that India accounted for nearly half the Covid19 cases reported worldwide last week and a quarter of the deaths

Many people have died in ambulances and car parks waiting for a bed or oxygen while morgues and crematoriums struggle to deal with a seemingly unstoppable flow of bodies

On Tuesday India passed a grim milestone of 20m cases amid growing calls for the country to go into a national lockdown

Deaths rose by a record 3780 during the past 24 hours health ministry data showed and daily infections rose by 382315 on Wednesday

The number has been in excess of 300000 every day for the past two weeks with the country adding 10 million cases in just over four months after taking more than 10 months to reach its first 10 million

Official data says more than 225000 people have died of Covid in India since the pandemic first began but many health experts believe the true death toll to be five to 10 times higher
In helmet and bulletproof vest Abir Moussi took her seat in Tunisias parliament  prompting amusement eye rolls and memes  but why

The MP and lawyer made the attentiongrabbing gesture after the speaker banned private security guards from all parties some of whom have been accused of assault

Moussi is a supporter of the autocratic former president Zine alAbidine Ben Ali who was ousted in Tunisias 2011 uprising She was sitting with a picture of Alis predecessor Habib Bourguiba which provoked laughter and resignation among Tunisians who are wearied by the seemingly endless fighting between the parliaments religious and secular blocs and increasingly concerned by rising cases of Covid19 and mounting national debt

Moussi a senior member of the secular Free Destourian party known by its French acronym PDL defended the old regime in court after the revolution which initially led to her being ostracised by her fellow party members and attacked in the street But she has enjoyed an unlikely rise in popularity after a growing dissatisfaction with the democratic transition

Tunisia has been plagued by sinking wages growing joblessness and worsening public services Several recent polls have confirmed that both PDL and Moussis own populist conspiracy theoryladen platform are popular among voters

Moussis personal rankings are second only to president Kais Saied who secured an overwhelming majority in elections in 2019 after running as an independent on a socially conservative platform

No theyre not really that small  

This photo of Joe and Jill Biden visiting former president Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn in Georgia has been doing the rounds on social media

It makes the Bidens look three times the size of the Carters and even the lounge chairs look like they are from a dolls house

But its not what it seems

guardianaustralias picture editor Carly Earl explains that the image is possibly distorted by using a wideangle lens used in smaller spaces where the photographer doesnt have room to move far enough to get everyone in the frame

But using a very wide lens while also standing very close to the subjects will distort the photo making those close to the camera appear giant while shrinking those further away

You dont need special gear to create this optical trickery If you have an iPhone 11 or 12 you actually can use the wideangle setting in the camera on the phone to capture a wider field of view

Just ask whatever former president you encounter to step back slightly then get yourself in front and snap

Amazons tax affairs are in the spotlight again after its latest income figures were released

The company brought in a record 38 billion 44bn from sales in Europe last year but did not have to pay any corporation tax to the Grand Duchy on the profits it made

                 

Accounts for Amazon EU Sarl  which it sells products to hundreds of millions of households in the UK and across Europe  show that the Luxembourg unit made a 12bn loss and therefore paid no tax They employ just 5262 staff there meaning that the income per person amounts to 84m

Paul Monaghan the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation said These figures are mindblowing even for Amazon  The bulk of Amazons UK income is booked offshore in the enormously lossmaking Luxembourg subsidiary which means that not only are they not making a meaningful tax contribution now but are unlikely to do so for years to come given the enormous carried forward losses they have now built up

An Amazon spokesperson said Amazon pays all the taxes required in every country where we operate Corporate tax is based on profits not revenues and our profits have remained low given our heavy investments and the fact that retail is a highly competitive low margin business

But Margaret Hodge a Labour MP has said It seems that Amazons relentless campaign of appalling tax avoidance continues  their revenues have soared under the pandemic while our high streets struggle

Last month Joe Biden tabled plans for a minimum corporation tax rate which would force large technology companies and corporations to pay taxes to national governments based on the sales they generate in each country irrespective of where they are based Germany and France have backed the plans but the UK has thus far remained silent

Amazon owner Jeff Bezos  the worlds richest person  welcomed Bidens proposals and said the company was supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate

Did you know only fathers names were included in marriage certificates in parts of the UK

Until now that is  A new legal change has come into force meaning marriage certificates in England and Wales will now include the names of both parents of the couple getting hitched instead of only that of the father or stepfather of each of the parties

The government previously resisted the change on cost grounds but this is now part of the introduction of a new digital system to modernise simplify and speed up the process by which marriages are registered helping to tackle a backlog

The Home Office say the reforms were the biggest changes to the marriage registration system since 1837 and would correct a historic anomaly by allowing for the mothers details to appear on the marriage entry for the first time

By nature glaciers go through phases of advance and retreat But lately these immense bodies of ice  so vast and ancient as to have carved the surface of the Earth  have been losing ground in a warming world

At the Franz Josef Glacier in the Southern Alps of New Zealand the difference could hardly be more stark

The pictures above show how much has changed between 1871 to 2016 but even a visitor returning to the glacier this year after 10 years would be able to notice the huge loss Since 2008 it has been retreating rapidly and lost a massive 156km in length at the fastest rate ever recorded

Over 40 years annual aerial surveys of the Southern Alps in New Zealand have shown the altitude at which snow persists throughout the year is climbing higher and the overall volume of ice reducing  with flowon effects for the glaciers

More recent surveys have been even more sobering The summer of 20172018 which saw January temperatures of nearly 3C warmer than average was the worst on record Some glaciers had shrunk so much they were hard to see many would be gone within decades

The outlook is similarly grim for glaciers the world over with humaninduced climate warming the chief factor in their decline

Tiny hummingbirds like this one have succeeded where many activists and protesters have fallen short  they have forced the construction of a controversial pipeline in western Canada to be halted

Campaigners have tried fruitlessly for years to stop the multibilliondollar project but after the discovery of an Annas hummingbird nest in a tree felled during the works construction was ordered to stop for the next four months

The migratory bird is not endangered but it is protected under federal law and community groups in southern British Columbia had raised the alarm that TransMountain was chopping down trees in vulnerable nesting areas

In a statement the company said it tries to clear trees outside of critical nesting seasons but admitted this is not always feasible

Marred by cost overruns in recent months the TransMountain project which was purchased by Justin Trudeaus government in 2018 will nearly triple capacity of the existing pipeline moving 890000 barrels of crude oil each day to the Pacific Ocean when complete

What do you think it takes to be a good spy

The British agency GCHQ has said apprentices on their scheme are four times more likely to have dyslexia than those on other organisations programmes  the result of a drive to recruit those whose brains process information differently

GCHQ says those with dyslexia have valuable skills spotting patterns that others miss  a key area the spy agency wants to encourage as it pivots away from dead letter drops and bugging towards hightech cybersecurity and data analysis

Were looking for people who can see something thats out of place in a bigger picture who have good visual awareness and can spot anomalies said Jo Cavan the director of strategy policy and engagement at GCHQ

If theyre sifting through large amounts of data from a large number of sources to prevent a terrorist attack or a serious organised criminal skills such as pattern recognition are key A lot of dyslexic colleagues have those strengths

Cavan said that the agency has valued neurodiversity during its 100year existence with the second world war codebreaker Alan Turing its best known employee with dyslexia

However the shift to online defence and security prompted by the governments integrated review in March will make dyslexic thinking skills an even bigger feature of GCHQs future she said

A report produced by the charity Made by Dyslexia with the consultancy EY suggested that some of the thinking skills people with dyslexia tend to be especially strong in include complex problemsolving empathy communication and critical thinking

These are becoming increasingly valued in workplaces as AI and machinelearning mean that more routine tasks are automated the authors said
Twenty women have come forward to accuse actorproducerdirector Noel Clarke of groping harassment and bullying the Guardian can reveal

Clarke who first became famous for his Kidulthood series of films strongly denies the accusations which were made shortly after Bafta announced that it planned to give Clarke a special award for outstanding British contribution to cinema

Our reporters spoke to 20 women all of whom knew Clarke in a professional capacity They variously accuse him of sexual harassment unwanted touching or groping sexually inappropriate behaviour and bullying between 2004 and 2019

The alleged misconduct also includes claims he secretly filmed a naked audition and allegedly showed colleagues sexually explicit photos and videos of women

Clarke said in a statement In a 20year career I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected I sincerely apologise I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing and intend to defend myself against these false allegations

Through his lawyers Clarke categorically denied every allegation that the Guardian put to him bar one accepting he once made inappropriate comments about one woman for which he later apologised but denying the rest of her complaints

In a 29page letter his lawyers said he categorically denies all of the other allegations from all 20 women in some cases questioning their credibility They deny their client is a serial sexual predator

The UK is being taken to court by three young people who claim their human rights are being breached by the governments failure to act decisively on the climate crisis

Adetola Stephanie Onamade Marina Tricks and Jerry Amokwandoh all students in their early 20s will tomorrow ask for a judicial review of government actions to cut national carbon emissions

The three claimants say that despite enshrining a net zero goal by 2050 in law and parliament declaring a climate emergency the government does not have an adequate roadmap to match the scale of the crisis

Frustrated at the pace of action they will argue that the UK has disregarded their rights to life family life and not be discriminated against which are protected under articles 2 8 and 14 of the Human Rights Act

Mexicanborn Tricks the youngest claimant aged 20 said she felt she had a duty to hold her government accountable She told the Guardian Were in the epicentre of destruction Its almost about weaponising the privileges we have of being in the global north

The other two young claimants are also from diaspora backgrounds Onamade from Nigeria and Trinidad and Tobago and Amokwandoh from Ghana They say they are also eager to highlight links between the climate crisis and wider social injustice be it gender race or wealth pointing out that environmental harm is not shared equally

In the UK illegal levels of air pollution disproportionately affect racially marginalised communities while the country is exporting its plastic pollution problem to poorer countries rather than tackling it domestically

The Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy which has lead responsibility for climate change declined to comment on the lawsuit

But in its response to a prelegal action letter the governments legal team called the claim pointless given that the government had published plans to meet its net zero target and was due to publish a net zero strategy before the Cop26 climate talks in November

In one of Pakistans most impoverished provinces an unusual mobile library service is offering students an education lifeline where schools have closed due to the coronavirus pandemic

Every Friday Roshan the camel visits the small town of Mand in the Balochistan province with his saddle panniers full of books

Roshan visits four villages staying in each at the home of a mobiliser where all the district children aged four to 16 can come to read borrow and exchange books with one another

Blighted by a separatist insurgency for the past two decades Balochistan has a 24 female literacy rate one of the lowest in the world compared with a male literacy rate of 56 It also has the highest percentage of children out of school in the country

When Covid closed the schools across the province two women in Mand Zubaida Jalal a federal minister in the Pakistan government and her sister Rahima Jalal headteacher of a local high school came up with the idea of involving a camel to help their cause

The Jalal sisters say there has been a lot of interest in the scheme from other areas and they have just started a similar library service in the city district of Gwadar Balochistan with a camel called Chirag

Chirag visits five towns each week accompanied by his handler and Ismail Yaqoob a volunteer and teacher Yaqoob says the children are often waiting for them to arrive in the village  Children are so interested in reading and in their studies but sadly the state does not invest in education

The world of English sport is uniting for an unprecedented fourday boycott of social media to protest against continued abuse and racism aimed at players managers pundits and countless others

Watford captain Troy Deeney has spoken openly of the racist abuse both he and his family are consistently subjected to He told BBC Breakfast he hopes the action which starts this afternoon puts pressure on social media giants to do more to eradicate online hate

The boycott first announced by the leading English football organisations begins at 3pm today until 1159pm on Monday Other sporting bodies have joined the action including Uefa the England and Wales Cricket Board the Professional Cricketers Association Premiership Rugby and the Lawn Tennis Association Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has given his backing to the campaign too  and guardiansport is also taking part by pausing posts from Guardian Sports Twitter Facebook and Instagram accounts

The campaign is calling for fresh measures to tackle racism sexism and discrimination  including a requirement for social media companies to display a warning if a user writes an abusive message and to ask them to enter personal data if they wish to send it They also want social media companies to have to submit a detailed quarterly report outlining efforts they have made to prevent abuse so they can be held more accountable

Will Woodward head of sport at Guardian News  Media said We generally arent in favour of boycotts or blackouts and believe news and robust comment are essential But the relentless abuse must stop Its important to take a stand

Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin also gave his unequivocal backing to the initiative saying Allowing a culture of hatred to grow with impunity is dangerous very dangerous not only for football but for society as a whole Weve had enough of these cowards who hide behind their anonymity to spew out their noxious ideologies

As these graphics change from white to blue you can see how quickly our worlds glaciers are shrinking

A new report has suggested that the rate of ice loss roughly doubles every 10 years  and scientists are saying that the rapid disappearance of mountain glaciers  separate from the Greenland and Antarctic ice shields  is one of the most dramatic signs of global heating

According to figures compiled exclusively for the Guardian 10 of the planets mountain glacier ice will have melted by the middle of this century even if humanity meets the goals of the Paris climate agreement

The loss is equivalent to more than 13200 cubic kilometres of water  enough to fill Lake Superior or more than 10 million Wembley Stadiums

Rawdah Mohamed says she is trying to fight against deeply rooted stereotypes against Muslim women

Earlier this month the 29yearold SomaliNorwegian model posted a selfie on Instagram with hands off my hijab criticising a proposed ban on the garment in France

The hashtag she used Handsoffmyhijab then went viral  along with its counterpart PasToucheAMonHijab on Twitter Instagram and TikTok  and thousands of women have been posting similar images in protest against the French senates vote to ban anyone under 18 from wearing a hijab in public

I started the hashtag as I felt the need to humanise the movement Mohamed told the Guardian Ethnic minority women are always spoken for I wished to take back the control of our narratives and tell our stories

rawdis added that the proposed legislation stems from discrimination and deeply rooted stereotypes against Muslim women

Speaking of her experience in the fashion industry Mohamed claimed she had been rejected for lots of jobs because clients feared a backlash from politicians and the media for featuring a woman in a hijab in advertising campaigns

We have failed India in our response to the coronavirus outbreak

Thats according to countless experts including Dr Anthony Fauci who told guardianaustralia that the situation in the worlds second most populous country has highlighted global inequality

The White Houses chief medical adviser said that countries inability to unite and deliver an adequate global response to Covid19 has caused it to overwhelm many countries  and he singled out wealthier nations for failing to provide equitable access to healthcare around the world

Fauci said while the World Health Organization was trying to accelerate support to India through the Covax initiative  a global program aimed at ensuring countries most in need get access to vaccines and other treatments  we have to do even more than that

He added I think that thats a responsibility that the rich countries need to assume Right now its a terrible tragic situation where people are dying because theres not enough oxygen where theres not enough hospital beds  Because were all in this together Its an interconnected world

Asked whether the situation in India and elsewhere such as in Papua New Guinea meant the world would struggle to ever contain Covid Fauci responded I believe we will get there

In the past 24 hours 360960 new cases were recorded in India the largest singleday total in the world taking the countrys total to nearly 18 million A further 3293 deaths the deadliest day so far took the death toll to 201187 Experts believe the official tally vastly underestimates the actual toll in the country of 13 billion

Justin Bieber has been accused of cultural appropriation and being a dilettante  dipping his toe in the culture after changing his hairstyle

As in 2016 when he was pictured in cornrows the images the Canadian singer posted this weekend of his new locs style prompted outrage

Stephanie Cohen cofounder and legal and political organiser at the Halo Collective a natural hair organisation said Bieber had no right to wear the hairstyle

My reasoning and understanding of someone wearing something not specific to their culture or ethnicity is that if they cannot speak for black or minority rights and be a consistent ally  then they have no right to wear something like locs

Irene Shelley editor of Black Beauty and Hair magazine said I think why people are annoyed with Justin Bieber casually wearing locs is that its seen as not respecting the origins of the style

Both Cohen and Shelley also explained that the common name for the hairstyle dreadlocks was rooted in a history of racism

Cohen said the name comes from the negative term dreadful  coined by slave owners and colonisers to describe the hairstyle and that the term has been so normalised in the English language that people often are ignorant towards its connotations

Shelley said loc wearers will sometimes take offence at their locs being called dreadlocks as they see a difference one is a hairstyle and the other is a lifestyle

The systematic killing and maiming of unarmed African Americans by police amount to crimes against humanity that should be investigated and prosecuted under international law an inquiry into US police brutality by leading human rights lawyers from around the globe has found

In a devastating report running to 188 pages human rights experts from 11 countries hold the US accountable for what they say is a long history of violations of international law that rise in some cases to the level of crimes against humanity

They point to what they call police murders as well as severe deprivation of physical liberty torture persecution and other inhuman acts as systematic attacks on the Black community that meet the definition of such crimes

They also call on the prosecutor of the international criminal court ICC in The Hague to open an immediate investigation with a view to prosecutions

This finding of crimes against humanity was not given lightly we included it with a very clear mind Hina Jilani one of the 12 commissioners who led the inquiry told the Guardian We examined all the facts and concluded that that there are situations in the US that beg the urgent scrutiny of the ICC

The pink supermoon isnt actually supposed to be pink

Australian astrophysicist Prof Jonti Horner says that the pink moon is not named because it takes on a particular colour but is named after a the colour of a North American native herb known as the creeping phlox

Horner says in the United States theres a tendency towards using the names that Native Americans have for full moons

The moon definitely wont be pink he said yesterday but if youre somewhere where there is pollution in the air then it could take on a more reddish tinge

Hospitals in parts of India are using social media to beg for help finding oxygen and key equipment as the countrys second coronavirus wave continues to build breaking global records

This week the number of recorded cases started to grow faster than in any other country passing 300000 a day along with more than 2000 deaths  thats close to twice the daily deaths India experienced during the first peak of the virus between July and September 2020

The real death toll from the virus in the worlds second most populous nation is thought to be significantly higher than official figures amid reports of some state governments fudging data and crematorium equipment in some states melting due to the constant heat of fires burning day and night

Oxygen and the lack of it has been the focus of significant alarm in recent days Government administrators hospitals and ordinary citizens are using Twitter and WhatsApp to try to find canisters of oxygen alongside beds in intensivecare units and drugs such as remdesivir or ivermectin Neither is proven to help with the virus but people are desperate

Experts speculate that highly infectious variants may be playing a role but say their impact was strongly exacerbated by the resumption of normal life  adding that victory against the virus was declared too quickly after six successive months of falling caseloads

India has been administering about 3m each day over the past few weeks which is one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world but this has barely made a dent in a country with an estimated adult population of around 900 million people

It will take months at least of consistent vaccination to reach a critical mass of the population In the short term the country can only rely on quarantines and social distancing a strategy that many who rely on daily wages to survive cannot afford

We often hear about how the planet is on fire apparently its also tilted its rotation

The massive melting of glaciers as a result of global heating has caused marked shifts in the Earths axis of rotation since the 1990s research has shown  and scientists say this demonstrates the profound impact we are having on the planet

If you imagine a metal rod going through the centre of the Earth  around which the planet spins  that is the Earths axis It determines what angle the Earth is at The north and south poles are the point where that that pole enters and exists the globe But those points are not fixed

Changes in how the Earths mass is distributed around the planet cause the axis and therefore the poles to move

In the past only natural factors such as ocean currents and the convection of hot rock in the deep Earth contributed to the drifting position of the poles

But the new research from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences shows that since the 1990s the loss of hundreds of billions of tonnes of ice a year into the oceans resulting from the climate crisis has caused the poles to move in new directions

British lawmakers have voted to declare that China is committing genocide against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang province

The motion passed on Thursday does not compel the government to act but is likely to mark a further decline in relations with China

In response Beijings embassy in the UK accused the MPs of having cooked up the motion with a view to discrediting and attacking China

Tens of thousands of Russians have rallied in cities across the country in a lastditch effort to secure the freedom of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny

The unsanctioned demonstrations have shown the determination of Navalnys core supporters who called for freedom for political prisoners in tense standoffs with riot police in helmets and body armour who had vowed to disperse any gatherings

At least 1500 people have been arrested nationwide with nearly half of them in St Petersburg

ProNavalny demonstrations had been called in more than 100 cities in response to reports of his declining health during a hunger strike in prison

UN human rights experts called on Russia to allow Navalny to be medically evacuated and treated abroad saying they believed his life was at risk

The show of strength is important as the Kremlin prepares to deliver a potentially lethal blow to Navalnys political organisation nationwide by declaring it extremist

In his annual address to the nation today Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that those who threatened the countrys core interests would regret it The comment has been seen as an attempt to portray Navalnys supporters in Russia as well as protests in Ukraine and Belarus as extensions of US foreign policy
Joe Biden has vowed to cut the USs planetheating emissions by at least 50 by the end of the decade

The move comes as America scrambles to regain international credibility after the climate denialist presidency of Donald Trump and in a ramping up of ambition aimed at rallying other countries to do more to confront the climate crisis

Ahead of a virtual gathering of dozens of world leaders in a climate summit called by Biden the White House announced that the US will aim to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 50 and 52 by 2030 based on 2005 levels

The Biden administration has reiterated it wants the US electricity grid to run 100 on clean sources such as solar and wind by 2035 in order to meet its goals and has framed an explosion in renewable energy and electric car production as a boon to American jobs

Some climate activists have said Biden needs to do even more however pointing out that the US is lagging after four years of Trump and the rest of the world has made scant progress to date in cutting emissions with greenhouse gases already rising again after a dip last year due to pandemicrelated shutdowns

Hundreds of thousands of predominantly black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire have not been commemorated in the same way as their white comrades due to decisions underpinned by pervasive racism

The investigation conducted by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and seen by the Guardian found that at least 116000  but potentially up to 350000  predominantly African and Middle Eastern first world war casualties may not be commemorated by name or at all

The findings also estimated that between 45000 and 54000 African and Asian casualties were commemorated unequally

During the first world war the Indian army provided Britain with over 12 million soldiers According to British Library research over four million black and Asian men were mobilised into the European and American armies with many being conscripted or coerced

All fallen military service personnel are supposed to be commemorated identically with their name engraved on a headstone over an identified grave or on a memorial to the missing

But quoting racist statements such as a governor saying in the 1920s that the average native  would not understand or appreciate a headstone the commission has concluded that soldiers were treated differently if they came from Commonwealth countries

The commission is expected to issue a formal apology today It comes more than a century after the end of WWI and against the backdrop of a reckoning over Britains relationship with its racist history

Less than 48 hours after it was launched the 45bn European Super League is on the brink of being relegated to the scrap heap of sporting history

All six Premier League clubs who had signed up to the breakaway league have now withdrawn  essentially leaving the project dead in the water following a furious backlash from fans and the UK government

It comes after the Football Association the governing body of the game in England warned that any team involved would be banned from all domestic competitions

Chelsea led the way amid fan protests outside Stamford Bridge stadium while Liverpools exit came after interventions from two key figures The captain Jordan Henderson said on behalf of the squad We dont like it and we dont want it to happen This is our collective position

Manchester Citys Raheem Sterling simply tweeted Ok bye  after his club became second to announce their departure

Arsenal said in their withdrawal statement that they had made a mistake and we apologise for it Tottenhams chairman Daniel Levy said he regretted the anxiety and upset caused

The stunning set of Uturns still leaves the reputations of the clubs owners at an alltime low as they attempt to repair their relationship with supporters And the row has also seemingly emboldened UK government ministers over wider plans to reform the governance of English football tilting the power balance more towards fans rather than billionaire owners

George Floyd never intended on becoming a wakeup call to America a rallying cry or symbol of police brutality But that was what Derek Chauvin who has now been found guilty of his murder did when he knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes on May 25 last year

According to those that knew him Floyd wanted to make a mark with his life especially if it meant using his athletic abilities through the NFL or NBA George turned to me and said I want to touch the world Jonathan Veal a teenage friend of Floyds told the New York Times

Before his death Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic out of work and looking for a new job He had moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life said Christopher Harris his lifelong friend

He was looking to start over fresh a new beginning Harris said He was happy with the change he was making

Derek Chauvin has been convicted of murder for killing George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes a crime that prompted a wave of protests in support of racial justice in the US and across the world

The jury found Chauvin guilty of all charges after concluding that the white former Minneapolis police officer killed the 46yearold Black man through a criminal assault by pinning him to the ground so he could not breathe properly A lack of oxygen in turn caused brain damage heart failure and death in May last year

Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison but is likely to receive a shorter sentence according to legal guidelines

The conviction does not put an end to the highly charged case which reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement as three other officers face trial later this year accused of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter

New Zealand has announced a series of proposals aimed at outlawing smoking for the next generation and is moving closer to its goal of being smokefree by 2025

The plans include the gradual increase of the legal smoking age which could extend to a ban on the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to anyone born after 2004

Also under consideration is a significant reduction in the level of nicotine allowed in tobacco products prohibiting filters setting a minimum price for tobacco and restricting the locations where tobacco and cigarettes can be sold

Smoking accounts for one in four cancer deaths in New Zealand and around half a million New Zealanders smoke daily The effects of that are mostfelt among Mori New Zealands indigenous people Mori women have the countrys highest smoking rates with about 30 smoking daily Cancer is the leading cause of death for Mori women and the second leading cause for Mori men

The new approach has been welcomed by a number of public health organisations but the plans also faced criticism for potential unintended consequences including the possibility of an expanded black market for tobacco

A controversial report into racial disparities in the UK attempts to normalise white supremacy and the government should reject its findings UN human rights experts have warned

The report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities published at the end of March concluded that while racism and racial injustice still existed geography family influence socioeconomic background culture and religion all had a greater impact on life chances The report said it did not find evidence of institutional racism in the areas it examined such as policing and health

In a statement the UN working group of experts on people of African descent said In 2021 it is stunning to read a report on race and ethnicity that repackages racist tropes and stereotypes into fact twisting data and misapplying statistics and studies into conclusory findings and ad hominem attacks on people of African descent

The statement went on to say This attempt to normalise white supremacy despite considerable research and evidence of institutional racism is an unfortunate sidestepping of the opportunity to acknowledge the atrocities of the past and the contributions of all in order to move forward

Does this paint look extra white to you

Its the whitestever paint and has been produced by academic researchers with the aim of boosting the cooling of buildings and tackling the climate crisis

It can even give a greater cooling power than common central air conditioners

The new paint reflects 98 of sunlight as well as radiating infrared heat through the atmosphere into space In tests it cooled surfaces by 45C below the average air temperature even in strong sunlight

Currently available reflective white paints are far better than dark roofing materials but they cant cool surfaces below the average air temperature like this new paint can

Whitepainted roofs have been used to cool buildings for centuries As global heating pushes temperatures up the technique is also being used on modern city buildings such as in Ahmedabad in India and New York City in the US

Project Drawdown a charity that assesses climate solutions estimates that white roofs and green roofs could avoid between 600m and 11bn tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050 roughly equivalent to two to three years of the UKs total annual emissions

Just 3 of the planet remains ecologically intact with healthy populations of all its original animals and undisturbed habitat a new study suggests

These fragments of wilderness undamaged by human activities are mainly in parts of the Amazon and Congo tropical forests east Siberian and northern Canadian forests and tundra and the Sahara

The new assessment combines maps of human damage to habitat with maps showing where animals have disappeared from their original ranges or are too few in number to maintain a healthy ecosystem

Invasive alien species including cats foxes rabbits goats and camels have had a major impact on native species in Australia with the study finding no intact areas left

The researchers have suggested reintroducing a small number of important species to some damaged areas such as elephants or wolves  a move that could restore up to 20 of the worlds land to ecological intactness

Some scientists said the new analysis underestimates the intact areas because the ranges of animals centuries ago are poorly known and the new maps do not take account of the impacts of the climate crisis which is changing the ranges of species

But it is widely accepted that the world is in a biodiversity crisis  what are the biggest threats though Swipe to read more and click the link in bio for the full story

This remarkable photo shows the biggest rockfall in the UK in 60 years

Starting on Tuesday a substantial section of a cliff on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset collapsed onto a beach below and into the sea

The rockfall happened just west of the seaside town of Weymouth and Dorset council said more cliff was expected to be lost with people being urged to stay away from the area

About 300 metres of the cliff was affected when 4000 tonnes came away in massive chunks some the size of cars falling towards the beach below

Student geologist Jodie Brewin told the BBC Its to do with reweathering and erosion that basically falls hand in hand and shapes this coastline

Southern England has seen a lot of rock and cliff falls and in February the chalk cliffs that border much of Kent and Sussex experienced a rise in falls There were warnings the coast could dramatically change by the summer

Magic mushrooms show promise in treatment for depression according to new trials

The results from a small phase two clinical trial have revealed that two doses of their active ingredient psilocybin appears to be as effective as the common antidepressant escitalopram in treating moderate to severe major depressive disorder at least when combined with psychological therapy

I think it is fair to say that the results signal hope that we may be looking at a promising alternative treatment for depression said Dr Robin CarhartHarris head of the centre for psychedelic research at Imperial College London and a coauthor of the study

CarhartHarris said psilocybin was thought to work in a fundamentally different way to escitalopram While both act on the brains serotonin system he said escitalopram seemed to work by helping people tolerate stress more easily

However CarhartHarris cautioned against seeking out magic mushrooms  a class A drug in the UK  for DIY treatment

Denmark has become the first European nation to revoke the residency permits of Syrian refugees on their insistence that some parts of the country have improved significantly and so are safe to return to

At least 189 Syrian have had their applications to renew their residency status denied since last year and currently around 500 people originally from Damascus and surrounding areas are being reevaluated

The issue has attracted widespread attention since 19yearold Aya AbuDaher from Nyborg pleaded her familys case on television earlier this month Holding back tears she asked what she had done wrong

According to Refugees Welcome Denmark 30 Syrians have already lost their appeals However since Copenhagen does not have diplomatic relations with Damascus it cannot directly deport people to Syria

Syrian men are generally exempt from the new policy because the authorities recognise they are at risk of being drafted into the Syrian military or punished for evading conscription The majority of affected people appear to be women and older people many of whom face being separated from their children

After 10 years of war Bashar alAssad is back in control of most of Syria and frontline fighting is limited to the north of the country However one of the main reasons people rose up during the Arab spring remains his secret police

Russia Thailand and Venezuela are among the countries that allow men to have rape convictions overturned if they marry the women or girls they have assaulted

Thats according to the UNs annual state of world population which has found that 20 countries still allow rapists to marry their victims to escape criminal prosecution

Dr Natalia Kanem executive director of the UN Population Fund UNFPA which published the report today said such laws were a way of subjugating women 

Dima Dabbous whose research is cited in the UNFPA report said that while is very difficult to change these laws its not impossible She added that the law in Morocco was repealed following widespread outrage when a young woman killed herself after she was forced to marry her rapist Jordan Palestine Lebanon and Tunisia followed suit

But in Kuwait a rapist is still allowed to legally marry his victim with the permission of her guardian In Russia if the perpetrator has reached 18 and has committed statutory rape with a minor below 16 he is exempt from punishment if he marries the victim 

In Thailand marriage can be considered a settlement for rape if the perpetrator is over 18 and the victim is over 15 if she consented to the offence and if the court grants permission for marriage

The report which focuses on bodily autonomy  the ability to make choices about your body free from violence or coercion  also highlighted that nearly half of women 45 in 57 countries are denied the right to say yes or no to sex with their partner use contraception or seek healthcare

In Mali Niger and Senegal the situation is particularly harrowing Fewer than one in 10 women make their own decisions about healthcare contraception and sex with their partners

Education is key to improving bodily autonomy said the report while laws must be changed and social norms must become more gender balanced Health providers can also play a critical role

Does this surprise you The controversial ruler of Dubai is one of the UKs largest landowners according to a Guardian analysis

We found that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid alMaktoum and his close family have acquired a land and property empire in Britain that appears to exceed 40000 hectares 100000 acres That area is about half as big as New York City 

The huge property portfolio ranges from mansions stables and training gallops across Newmarket to white stucco houses in some of Londons most exclusive addresses and extensive moorland in the Scottish Highlands

The Guardian has mapped these expansive private holdings linked to Sheikh Mohammed who is vicepresident and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates using Land Registry records and company filings

The exact scale of his British landholding is not known because most of the properties connected to him are owned via offshore companies in the tax havens of Guernsey and Jersey

A lawyer for Sheikh Mohammed declined to confirm any details of the properties or companies that own them saying his financial affairs are private and confidential

What do you think of this

French MPs have voted to suspend domestic airline flights on routes that can be travelled by direct train in less than two and a half hours as part of a series of climate and environmental measures

The ban is a watereddown version of a key recommendation from President Emmanuel Macrons citizens climate convention which had originally recommended the scrapping of all flights between French destinations where an alternative direct train journey of less than four hours existed

This was reduced to two and a half hours after strong objections from certain regions and from Air FranceKLM which like other airlines has been badly hit by local and international Covid19 restrictions on travel

It will mean the end of short internal flights from Orly airport south of Paris to Nantes and Bordeaux among others though connecting flights through Charles de GaulleRoissy airport north of the French capital will continue

Details of the exact routes that will be halted will be published in the official decree Flights from Paris to Nice which takes about six hours by train and Toulouse four hours by train will continue

The measure part of a climate and resilience bill was passed despite crossparty opposition The Socialist MP Jol Aviragnet said the measure would have a disproportionate human cost and warned of job losses in the airline sector Other MPs including from the Green party complained that watering down the climate conventions recommendation had made the measure meaningless
40 years on from the Brixton riots which spread across the UK during a recession in which black people lost their jobs in disproportionate numbers experts are warning that coronavirus has exposed deeprooted inequalities that still exist in the employment market

Young black workers in Britain have been hit disproportionately hard during the pandemic according to Guardian analysis with more than 40 unemployed  three times worse than white workers of the same age

One can only assume Hideki Matsuyama did not feel the heavy burden of history as he made his way around the fairway of Augusta National on Sunday There is no other reasonable explanation for the manner in which the 29yearold won the 85th edition of the Masters

With his final putt Matsuyama secured a oneshot victory over Will Zalatoris to become the first Asianborn player to don the famed Green Jacket and the only Japanese male to win a major Two women from Japan have also won majors Hisako Higuchi at the 1977 LPGA Championship and Hinako Shibuno at the 2019 Womens British Open

A shellshocked Matsuyama who has never been entirely comfortable with the huge media attention he receives in Japan recognised that his victory could boost golf in a country that has struggled to match its love of the sport with major winners

Matsuyamas victory is also a muchneeded feelgood story as Tokyo prepares to host an Olympics dogged by scandal and concerns about safety amid the coronavirus pandemic

Our team in Australia has spent the past three years tracking Indigenous and nonIndigenous deaths in police custody

The first time we published in August 2018 an exclusive analysis of 10 years of coronial data found at least 407 Indigenous people had died in police or prison custody since the end of the royal commission in 1991 In 2019 that figure had increased to 424

Today it stands at 474

Aboriginal deaths in custody are a national shame not because Aboriginal people die at higher rates in custody than nonIndigenous prisoners but because Aboriginal people are disproportionately arrested remanded and jailed and so die at higher rates in custody as a proportion of the total population

Her stand prompted a conversation about the power of names and has inspired others to reclaim theirs The actor previously known as Tanya Fear tweeted My full name is Tanyaradzwa which means we have been comforted I was named this because I was born the year my grandfather died

In 2017 and 2021 respectively Taulupe Falatau and Uilisi Halaholo rugby players of Tongan descent reclaimed their real names from Toby and Willis  anglicised nicknames they were given

Reclaiming a name is an act of resistance the educationalist Pranav Patel has said adding that schools can play a major role

If teachers dont offer that validation children feel they have to acquiesce and assimilate to make others comfortable and that becomes the norm he said So when you ask someone how to say or spell their name it has an impact It says to them your name matters you matter Its simple

Are teachers valued enough

One in three teachers in the UK plan to quit the classroom within five years because of increased workload and decreasing respect for the profession according to a major union survey

The poll by the National Education Union NEU revealed that out of 10000 members 35 said they would definitely not be working in education by 2026 while twothirds 66 said the status of the profession has got worse and blamed government for failing to listen to or value teachers

These findings come after a year in which the education profession  as key workers  have been provided few safety protections had to improvise solutions where government had simply left a void and were met with a pay freeze for their troubles said Kevin Courtney NEU joint general secretary

Amid anger over the UK governments pay freeze for public sector workers the NEU has called for a 7 pay rise for teachers this year They also agreed to survey members to build towards a ballot for national strikes if ministers fail to meet their pay demands
What would a tropical reef look like if it could escape the manmade perils of global heating and overfishing

A new study suggests it would look like Rowley Shoals an isolated archipelago of reefs 260km off Australias northwest coast  seen in the video above

Fish biologist Matthew Birt led the study on the three reefs that make up the uninhabited Rowley Shoals using cameras that allowed researchers to analyse the marine life over 14 years

They found the relative isolation of Rowley Shoals protections from commercial fishing and its shape and location has sustained threatened species and rich biodiversity during a time of unprecedented degradation of coral reefs elsewhere around the world

Globally threatened giant fish like the humphead Maori wrasse and humphead parrotfish were seen regularly at Rowley Shoals

Coral ecologist Dr James Gilmour said Rowley Shoals was now one of Australias healthiest reef systems adding that the high numbers and range of fish made the coral ecosystem more resilient

From guardiansport With the Olympics just months away North Koreas sports ministry says it will not participate in the Tokyo Games this year to protect athletes from the global health crisis caused by the coronavirus

North Korea has one of the worlds strictest quarantine regimes despite the governments denial that any cases have been detected in the country The measures have allowed the government to increase its control over daily life to levels similar to the famine years of the 1990s according to analysts 

Outsiders doubt whether the country has escaped the pandemic entirely given its poor health infrastructure and a porous border it shares with China its economic lifeline

North Korea sent 22 athletes to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea along with government officials performance artists journalists and a 230member cheering group

In the US 12 of people took 66 of all flights in 2018
In France 2 of people took half of the flights
In China 5 of households took 40 of flights and in India just 1 of households took 45 of all the flights

This data is from a new report by environmental charity Possible which collated data from the countries with the highest aviation emissions

The report shows a worldwide pattern of a small group taking a large proportion of flights while many people do not fly at all

Possible the group that produced the new report is calling for the introduction of a frequent flyer levy whereby the first flight in a year incurs little or no tax and it therefore does not penalise annual family holidays But the levy then ramps up for each additional flight

This report shows that while the poorest communities are already suffering the impacts of a warming climate the benefits of highcarbon lifestyles are enjoyed only by the few A progressive tax on aviation would treat frequent flying as the luxury habit it is said Alethea Warrington a campaigns manager at Possible

Do you think this elite group should be charged a frequent flyer tax

The rate at which the worlds forests are being destroyed increased sharply last year

Altogether 122m hectares of tree cover were lost in the tropics in 2020 an increase of 12 on 2019

According to data from the University of Maryland and the online monitoring platform Global Forest Watch the losses were particularly severe in the Amazon the Congo and southeast Asia

These forests are vital as carbon sinks in the regulating the global climate as well as for their irreplaceable ecosystems

Brazils forested areas fared the worst with 17m hectares destroyed an increase of about a quarter on the previous year

Frances Seymour a distinguished senior fellow at World Resources Institute said countries that faced high levels of debt owing to the economic fallout from the pandemic could be tempted to give in to commercial interests to exploit their forests unsustainably or could be forced to reduce resources for forest protection

Unless we offer alternatives it is likely that governments will try to recover on the back of forest loss particularly governments facing high levels of debt she said The longer we wait to tackle deforestation the more likely it is that these carbon sinks will go up in smoke
Are you surprised at this number

An estimated 46 million Americans said they would be unable to afford quality healthcare if they needed it today a new survey from medical group Gallup has found

The survey also found wide racial and economic disparities in who believes they can afford healthcare

The US spends more on healthcare than any nation in the world and more than twice as much as the average highincome country At the same time it has the lowest life expectancy and highest suicide rates among 11 developed nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD

Unfortunately its not surprising that millions of Americans cant afford healthcare said Dr Vikas Saini president of the Lown Institute a thinktank whose advocacy work has examined how high prices on insulin have led to rationing and even death among diabetics It is however shocking and kind of outrageous but not surprising

A oneyearold baby playing outside survived a rubber bullet to the eye but other children including a 13yearold girl were killed

Soldiers and police have killed hundreds in brutal suppression against weeks of mass protests demanding a restoration of democracy and the release of detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi

Chrissy Teigen has said goodbye to her 137 million Twitter followers

The TV personality cookbook author and former model posted a series of final posts last night acknowledging the abuse and hatred on the platform

Like most women with a large platform on the site Teigen whose funny posts about her family food and cultural commentary sent her popularity soaring had received a barrage of threats and harassment in recent years But starting in late 2017 things got even uglier when Teigan and her husband singer John Legend were targeted by conspiracy group QAnon

Teigen also faced online harassment after she publicly shared that she had a miscarriage last year  with trolls saying she was using her grief to gain popularity

Her decision to leave Twitter further highlights the proliferation of unchecked abuse and hate on the social platform While measures have been rolled out to combat online abuse such as changing its algorithms and hiding potentially abusive replies its methods are hardly foolproof and many have been speaking out against what they face on a daily basis

In one of her last tweets Teigen asked her followers to recognise the power of their words
From guardianus The numbers are staggering

Today Democratic senators represent nearly 40 million more voters than Republican senators  but the Senate is split 5050 with the vicepresident Kamala Harris wielding the tiebreaking vote

Critics of the Senate say that for years now the chamber has not been a field of fair democratic play paralysed by its own internal rules and insulated from the popular will by a 230yearold formula for unequal representation

It currently means that no matter how popular the bills that Democrats are passing through the House of Representatives may be they stand almost no chance of becoming law And this gap between power and representation is only set to get worse

By 2040 70 of Americans are expected to live in the 15 largest states and to be represented by only 30 senators while 30 of Americans will have 70 senators voting on their behalf according to analysis by David Birdsell of Baruch Colleges School Of Public And International Affairs

Theres no doubt that the Senate is broken and has been broken for a long period of time said Ira Shapiro a former Senate staffer Clinton administration trade official and the author of Broken Can the Senate Save Itself and the Country Its been in decline probably for 30 years and that decline has deepened over the last 12 years

A red cloud lit up the night sky after the eruption began in Fagradalsfjall on Friday about 40km 25 miles from the capital Reykjavik A nofly zone was established in the area but the eruption appeared to be subsiding as of Saturday evening

Located between the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates among the largest on the planet Iceland is a seismic and volcanic hotspot as the two plates move in opposite directions

Since the immediate area around Fagradalsfjall is uninhabited the Department for Civil Protection said it did not believe the activity posed any threat to structures or settlements in the area

Members and supporters of the AsianAmerican community attended rallies of solidarity across the US this weekend

It comes in the wake of the killing of eight people in shootings in Atlanta six of whom were women of Asian decent

Police have been criticised for their response to the shooting failing to acknowledge the deaths as hate crimes because the shooter had denied antiAsian racism as a motive

The killings in Atlanta come in the context of a recent global surge in abuse and assaults often carried out with direct reference to Covid since the pandemic began and Donald Trump and others began talking of the China virus

A spate of assaults in the US in particular on older people have stirred outrage AntiChinese hate crime rose by a fifth in the UK in the early stages of the outbreak while nearly one in five Chinese Australians say they have been physically threatened or attacked since it began

Over the weekend in New York City people held placards in Columbus Park in the Chinatown neighbourhood of Manhattan yesterday while a candlelight vigil was held at the CityCounty Building in downtown Pittsburgh

There were similar solidarity rallies held in Atlanta Detroit and Los Angeles

A UK startup is hoping to develop an ultraquiet bioelectric plane that will help in the fight against climate change 

Faradair is working on a shorthop 18seat plane that will use electric motors to power takeoff and landing the part of any flight with the highest noise and carbon emissions

Once cruising at a speed of about 230mph the plane known as the Beha  will switch to its turbogenerator powered by biofuel which will also recharge the motors with assistance from solar panels ready for the aircrafts descent

It will be the first aircraft produced since the 1920s to have a threewinged box design It will be able to convert from passenger to cargo in just 15 minutes because of its palletised interior

While the creators are hopeful the plane will be carbon neutral eventually going all electric straight away was not going to be possible and the Beha will go hybrid to begin with using sustainable aviation fuels

The hope is to have the Beha flying passengers by 2026 in which case youll have to keep your eyes peeled as your ears wont be of much use in locating this ultraquiet plane
The oil industry knew at least 50 years ago that air pollution from burning fossil fuels posed serious risks to human health only to spend decades aggressively lobbying against clean air regulations a trove of internal documents seen by the Guardian reveal

The documents which include internal memos and reports show the industry was long aware that it created large amounts of air pollution that pollutants could lodge deep in the lungs and be real villains in health effects and even that its own workers may be experiencing birth defects among their children

But these concerns did little to stop oil and gas companies and their proxies spreading doubt about the growing body of science linking the burning of fossil fuels to an array of health problems that kill millions of people around the world each year

The response from fossilfuel interests has been from the same playbook  first they know then they scheme then they deny and then they delay said Geoffrey Supran a researcher at Harvard University who has studied the history of fossilfuel companies and climate change Theyve fallen back on delay subtle forms of propaganda and the undermining of regulation

Scaling walls and scaffolding parkour climate activists in Paris are using their skills to turn off store signs with the aim of sending a message about light pollution

With a strict curfew from 6pm to 6am in place across France few people can be found walking along the usually bustling Champslyses in the capital Despite this many of the stores lining the avenue have continued to keep their illuminated signs and window displays on through the night

The signs caught the ire of the On The Spot collective  eight practitioners of the urban acrobatic sport parkour  and they decided to take things into their own hands or feet

Turning off the lights is a symbolic message about the basic efforts that businesses should be making Kevin Ha a 28yearold completing his PhD in oceanography and the leader of the group said Its not the efficiency of the operation that matters Obviously we cannot turn off all the lights in Paris but we hope to show how even small actions can make a difference

Ha emphasised however that people should not attempt to climb buildings or walls unless properly trained saying Dont try this at home kids

Asian Americans from all 50 states reported experiencing everything ranging from verbal abuse to physical assaults from getting coughed on to getting denied services because of their ethnicity

The number of hate incidents reported to our center represent only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur but it does show how vulnerable Asian Americans are to discrimination and the types of discrimination they face the report authors wrote

More than 68 of the abuse was verbal harassment or namecalling while 111 was physical the report found

If whales are so smart whyd they hang around to be killed 

The answer to the ageold question 
They didnt 

Thats according to a remarkable new study which has shed light on how whales behaved when attacked by humans in the 19th century

Using newly digitised logbooks detailing the hunting of sperm whales in the north Pacific the authors of the paper published by the Royal Society discovered that within just a few years the strike rate of the whalers harpoons fell by 58

This simple fact leads to an astonishing conclusion that information about what was happening to them was being collectively shared among the whales who made vital changes to their behaviour As their culture made fatal first contact with ours they learned quickly from their mistakes and abandoned their usual defensive formations instead swimming upwind to escape

Sperm whales are highly socialised animals able to communicate over great distances and also possess the largest brain on the planet

Scientists say their findings will have implications for the way whales will react to changes wreaked by humans in the 21st century

What do you think of these skybrators 

They are a new bladeless wind turbine that can generate clean energy without the environmental impact of large windfarms  and they have been creating quite a buzz online

Green energy pioneers based just outside Madrid Spain have drawn up a turbine design that can harness energy from winds without the sweeping white blades considered synonymous with wind power

It has already raised eyebrows on social media where the turbine has been likened to a giant vibrating sex toy or skybrator

The bladeless turbines stand at 3 metres high a curvetopped cylinder fixed vertically with an elastic rod To the untrained eye it appears to waggle back and forth not unlike a car dashboard toy In reality it is designed to oscillate within the wind range and generate electricity from the vibration

The turbines inventor David Yez says its unusual technology and design can help fill the gaps where traditional windfarms might not be appropriate  for example in urban and residential areas where the impact of a windfarm would be too great and the space to build one would be too small

The turbine is no danger to bird migration patterns or wildlife particularly if used in urban settings For the people living or working nearby the turbine would create noise at a frequency virtually undetectable to humans

Is your fish a fake 

A Guardian Seascape analysis of 44 recent studies of more than 9000 seafood samples from restaurants fishmongers and supermarkets in more than 30 countries found that 36 were mislabelled exposing seafood fraud on a vast global scale

Fish fraud has long been a known problem worldwide Because seafood is among the most internationally traded food commodities often through complex and opaque supply chains it is highly vulnerable to mislabelling 

However the studies in question sometimes target species known to be problematic meaning it is inaccurate to conclude that 36 of all global seafood is necessarily mislabelled 

The studies also use different methodologies and samples Nor are fish always deliberately mislabelled  although the huge majority of substitutions involved lowerpriced fish replacing higherpriced ones indicating fraud rather than carelessness

This is Brittany Higgins moments before delivering a powerful speech outside Parliament House in Canberra the building where she says she was raped by a colleague

The former Liberal party staffer who spoke out against the governments response to her allegations addressed more than a thousand people on Monday at a Womens March4Justice rally

She said For so long it felt like the people around me did not care about what happened because of what it might mean for them It was so confusing because these people were my idols I had dedicated my life to them Suddenly they treated me differently I was not a person who had just gone through a lot of changes I was a political problem

Tens of thousands of people attended the March4Justice rallies across Australia calling for an end to genderbased violence and workplace harassment

Organisers of the march carried a petition signed by nearly 70000 people calling for action to better protect women from abuse and harassment

They wanted to present it to the prime minister but Scott Morrison refused to meet them He instead offered a meeting in his office which was refused

The demonstrations were sparked in part by Higgins claims and a nowdeceased womans allegation that she was raped by attorney general Christian Porter in 1988  a claim he has strenuously denied

At every rally in every city women carried signs saying I believe her I stand with her Some also carried signs for Sarah Everard a 33yearold woman allegedly murdered in London

It began in grief and silence but ended in anger and violence

As hundreds gathered in south London to remember Sarah Everard police were seen dragging mourners from the vigil and trampling flowers and candles laid out in tribute to her 

Tensions were high before the vigil which had officially been cancelled after Londons police force refused to give the organisers a permit citing regulations designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus 

That compounded anger at the force already high after a serving officer was charged with Everards kidnap and murder

The Metropolitan police have defended their policing of the vigil with assistant commissioner Helen Ball saying officers were put into a position where enforcement action was necessary because of the overriding need to protect peoples safety

Priti Patel the home secretary and the citys mayor Sadiq Khan both said they had demanded an explanation amid accusations that officers had grabbed women during clashes with the crowd and mismanaged the largely peaceful vigil at Clapham Common 

Everards disappearance as she walked home on the evening of 3 March has provoked a huge outpouring of grief and dismay in Britain at the failure of police and wider society to tackle violence against women

Her death sparked months of protests in the city and her name became a rallying cry at nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice and policing Numerous high profile figures including Joe Biden had called for criminal charges against the police officers who were involved in the raid

The grand jury did charge one of the officers Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing shots that went into another home with people inside But jurors didnt indict any of the officers on charges directly related to Taylors death

Writing for the Guardian professor of criminal justice Shanita Hubbard explores how we can honour Breonna Taylor by putting a spotlight on the way society minimises violence against black women

Does this statistic surprise you

Virtually all young women in the UK have been subjected to sexual harassment according to a survey from UN Women UK which warns that most women have lost faith that the abuse will be dealt with

Among women aged 1824 97 said they had been sexually harassed while 80 of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces

This is a human rights crisis Its just not enough for us to keep saying this is too difficult a problem for us to solve  it needs addressing now said Claire Barnett executive director of UN Women UK

We are looking at a situation where younger women are constantly modifying their behaviour in an attempt to avoid being objectified or attacked and older women are reporting serious concerns about personal safety if they ever leave the house in the dark  even during the daytime in winter

The YouGov survey of more than 1000 women exposes a damning lack of faith in the UK authorities desire and ability to deal with sexual harassment  96 of respondents did not report incidents with 45 saying it would not change anything

Tashnuva Anan Shishirs journey to the newsroom has not been an easy one She left home after unbearable bullying and her father stopped talking to her for years

The 29yearold says she went for auditions with other channels but only Boishakhi was brave enough to take me in

The LGBT community faces widespread discrimination in the southAsian country with a colonialera law still in place punishing gay sex with prison though enforcement is rare

Ahead of going live for Mondays broadcast Shishir revealed that she was terrified but managed to get the better of her fears I dont want any members of the transgender community to suffer I dont want them to live a miserable life I hope they will find work according to their skills

Apparently its a good thing to lose your head sometimes  at least if you are a sacoglossan sea slug

Scientists say that this incredible species can decapitate itself  and then regrow an entirely new body  complete with a beating heart and other vital organs

The process from shedding all of itself below the neck to regrowing a new body took less than a month in an extreme example of a process known as autotomy

Reported in the journal Current Biology Sayaka Mitoh of Nara Womens University and colleague Yoichi Yusa wrote how in their studies of the life history of the sea slugs they spotted something odd

Three of the younger labraised sea slugs and one wild specimen being reared autotomised at their neck position leaving behind a body with its heart kidney intestine and most of the reproductive organs

While the bodies didnt survive very long the decapitated heads started feeding on algae within hours and healed the wound within a day

The scientists think the sea slugs may have developed the technique as a way of getting rid of a parasite in their body

Other animals that can regenerate body parts include salamanders that can regrow their full tails axolotls colloquially known as Mexican walking fish that can regrow limbs and some fish that can regrown vital organs

How much food did you think were wasting every year

According to the UN its around one billion tonnes annually Thats almost as much as the weight of 150 Pyramids of Giza or 90000 Eiffel Towers

The food discarded in homes alone was 74kg per person each year on average around the world the UN found in the most comprehensive assessment on the issue to date

In the UK which has some of the best data the edible waste represents about eight meals per household each week The study also found waste was around double the previous best estimate

The report also includes data on food waste in restaurants and shops with 17 of all food dumped Some food is lost on farms and in supply chains as well meaning that overall a third of food is never eaten

The waste damages efforts to help the billions of people who are either hungry or cannot afford a healthy diet but also harms the environment

Food waste and loss causes about 10 of the emissions driving the climate emergency and intensive farming is a key cause of the biodiversity crisis and global pollution

If food waste was a country it would have the third highest emissions after only the US and China
Ships suspended in midair isnt something you usually spot during a stroll along the English coastline

But David Morris recently had to do a double take when he noticed a giant tanker evidently floating above the water as he looked out to sea from a hamlet near Falmouth in Cornwall

The extraordinary sight which he captured on camera is an example of an optical illusion known as a superior mirage

Such illusions are reasonably common in the Arctic but can also happen in UK winters when the atmospheric conditions are right though they are very rare

The effect is caused by a meteorological phenomenon called a temperature inversion when warm air sits on top of a band of colder air and plays havoc with our visual perception The inversion in Cornwall was caused by chilly air lying over the relatively cold sea with warmer air above

David Braine a BBC meteorologist explains Since cold air is denser than warm air it bends light towards the eyes of someone standing on the ground or on the coast changing how a distant object appears

South Koreas first transgender soldier who was forcibly discharged after having gender reassignment surgery has been found dead

Byun Heesoo 23 enlisted voluntarily in 2017 and went on to have gender confirmation surgery in 2019 in Thailand

The defence ministry classified her loss of male genitals as a mental or physical handicap and a military panel ruled in early 2020 that Byun would be compulsorily discharged

Byun appeared at a press conference at the time to plead to be allowed to serve wearing her uniform and saluting the gathered journalists and cameras

Im a soldier of the Republic of Korea she said her voice breaking Serving in the military had always been her childhood dream she said

The local mental health care clinic said Byun made an attempt to kill herself three months ago Police are investigating her death

South Korea remains deeply conservative about matters of sexual and gender identity and is less tolerant of LGBT rights than some other parts of Asia with many gay and transgender Koreans living largely under the radar

International rights groups have expressed concern about the way the country treats gay soldiers who are banned from engaging in samesex acts and can face up to two years in prison if caught  even though such actions are legal in civilian life

SpaceXs futuristic Starship looked like it aced a touchdown Wednesday but then exploded on the landing pad with so much force that it was hurled into the air

The failure occurred just minutes after SpaceX declared success The landing was at least better than the last two times where the prototypes crashlanded in fireballs in previous test flights

The fullscale prototype of Elon Musks envisioned Mars ship soared more than six miles after lifting off from the southern tip of Texas on Wednesday It descended horizontally over the Gulf of Mexico and then flipped upright just in time to land

The shiny bulletshaped rocketship remained intact this time at touchdown prompting the SpaceX commentator John Insprucker to declare third times a charm as the saying goes before SpaceX ended its webcast of the test

But then the Starship exploded and was tossed in the air before slamming down into the ground in flames

A first orbital Starship flight is planned for years end Musk has said he intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with the Starship in 2023

Selfcontrol  its a trait many of us often struggle to exercise Its linked with higher intelligence  and a new study has now found it is something cuttlefish are also able to exert

Researchers used an adapted version of the Stanford marshmallow test in which children were given the choice of scoffing an immediate reward one marshmallow or waiting to earn a delayed but better reward two marshmallows on six cuttlefish in an aquarium environment

Overtime  and overall  the chunky squidlike creatures delayed gratification when it led to a prey item of higher quality The eightarmed animals were able to maintain delays for periods of up to 50 seconds to 130 seconds the authors said

As well as humans  and now seemingly cuttlefish  chimps parrots and crows have also evolved to exert selfcontrol

Previous research had suggested that some primates and birds exhibited this advanced level of selfcontrol because they were social species that maintained multiple relationships and used tools

Instead the studys author speculates selfcontrol might have evolved in cuttlefish to maximise efficiency
