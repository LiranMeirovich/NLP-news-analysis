"“When I led the Move Forward Party to victory in the general elections of May 2023, the country was euphoric,” writes Pita Limjaroenrat.⁠
⁠
In a guest essay, the former party leader argues that “many Thais, along with international observers, believed the kingdom was on the cusp of a progressive renaissance, with the electorate’s will finally triumphant”.⁠
⁠
“A post-election pact among opposition parties seemed to pave the way for me to become the next prime minister through a parliamentary vote,” he says. “That initial euphoria, however, proved premature.” ⁠
⁠
Mr Limjaroenrat recounts that “in the aftermath of the elections, conservative forces swiftly mobilised to stymie our coalition’s formation”. And he argues that the country’s democratic standing is poised for “further deterioration as the its constitutional court contemplates the dissolution of Move Forward”.⁠

"How many Securities and Exchange Commission chairs can you name? Even in Washington it is hard to imagine a passer-by being able to come up with more than one. ⁠
⁠
Yet during his time at the SEC, Gary Gensler, the current chair, has become remarkably well-known, even notorious. ⁠
⁠
So much so that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, recently said at a bitcoin convention that he would fire him “on day one”. ⁠
⁠
Mr Gensler came to the role in 2021 with an urgent to-do list. There is no disputing that he has since been productive.⁠

"For a while things were looking awful on Monday. During the Asian trading session Japan’s benchmark Topix share index had fallen by 12%, marking its worst day since 1987. ⁠
⁠
Stock prices in South Korea and Taiwan had tanked by 9% and 8%, respectively, and European markets were falling.⁠
⁠
Before trading began in America, the VIX, which measures how wildly traders expect share prices to swing, was at a level it had only reached early in the covid-19 pandemic and after Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. ⁠
⁠
The previous week’s rout in global markets seemed to be spiralling into a full-blown crisis.⁠
⁠
Mercifully, the panic started to ebb once Wall Street opened for business. The VIX fell back to only its highest during the crash of 2022; by the end of the day the S&P 500 index of large American firms was down by a painful, but not catastrophic, 3%. ⁠

"It seems all but inevitable that Iran will respond to a pair of Israeli assassinations carried out last month. How it will answer, however, is impossible to predict.⁠
⁠
After decades of using proxy militias to harass Israel, Iran set a new precedent in April: a direct attack on its territory would be answered in kind. That has led to increased fears of imminent conflict in the region.⁠
⁠
Israel will rely on an American-led coalition of Western and Arab allies to help it fend off any air strikes. But if missiles do get through and cause major damage, they would force Israel to launch its own retaliatory barrage.⁠

"One autumn day Patrick Doherty was walking his dog up a steep mountain when he noticed he was, unusually for him, running out of breath. ⁠
⁠
The eventual diagnosis was terrifying: amyloidosis, a rare genetic disease. The prognosis was even worse: it would cause him years of pain until it finally killed him.⁠
⁠
In the face of such terrible fortune, though, Mr Doherty had a stroke of luck. He was able to join a trial of a new medical therapy and, with just a single injection, he was apparently cured.⁠
⁠
The treatment edited Mr Doherty’s genes using CRISPR-Cas9, a technology that has moved from lab to clinic at lightning speed. ⁠

Scientists have already used gene editing to improve the vision of people with an inherited condition that causes blindness. It will gather pace in the coming year, tackling cardiovascular disease and cancer.⁠

"When Sir Keir Starmer proposed a state-owned company called Great British Energy in September 2022, he was aping the man dragged out of 10 Downing St two months earlier. ⁠
⁠
Sir Keir had studied Boris Johnson’s bracing pledge to “take back control” in the Brexit referendum of 2016.⁠
⁠
Adapting this mantra, the then opposition leader griped that the only governments with a stake in Britain’s energy system were foreign ones, from Sweden, France and China. GB Energy would secure “British power for British people”. ⁠
⁠
It would also allow him to ditch a more radical plan for wholesale renationalisation. Now that Labour is in government, the question is whether good politics can become good policy. ⁠

To this day Chinese authorities have proposed no cause for the disaster. Instead, the country’s leaders have sought to bury the tragedy in a hole of forgetting. ⁠

"In different ways, two fast-food restaurants help explain one of the biggest puzzles in today’s business environment: the state of the American consumer.⁠
⁠
One is Chipotle Mexican Grill, a canteen-like restaurant famous for its burritos and bowls, the cheapest of which costs $10.60. The other is McDonald’s, home of the hamburger. Its cheapest meal deal is $5.⁠
⁠
You might think Chipotle would be suffering more than McDonald’s in a world where consumers face high housing costs, utility bills and petrol prices, their savings are running down, and the job market is getting shakier. But you would be wrong. Chipotle’s sales grew by a whopping 18% in the quarter from April to June, compared with the same three months in 2023.⁠
⁠
Under the Golden Arches, it was a different story. In the latest quarter the chain’s sales on a like-for-like basis fell by 1%, compared with the previous year.⁠

Last year, for example, it was in August that American share prices began their final protracted fall before a storming bull run that took them to new all-time highs.⁠

That may be down to liquidity, which, with many investors off reclining in the sun, tends to be slightly thinner during the holiday season than in the rest of the year. ⁠

"Do you have a never-ending TBR list? The number of books that people are told they should read seems overwhelming. ⁠
⁠
One way to prune is to see where best-book lists overlap, on the theory that texts that appear most often must be really worth your while.⁠

That is what Shane Sherman, a computer programmer and creator of thegreatestbooks.org, did. He used more than 300 lists to come up with a list of lists, which he calls, not entirely seriously, the “greatest books of all time”.

Germany would probably have preferred to play no role in the complex, multi-country deal that saw the release of 16 prisoners from Russian and Belarusian jails.⁠

But it could not remain aloof, because Vladimir Putin was adamant about securing the release from German captivity of Vadim Krasikov, a hitman who in 2019 was sent by Russian security services to murder a Chechen exile in Berlin. ⁠

"Cooling off is easy in Barcelona. Swim in the sea, sip sangria—or just look like a holidaymaker. Recently residents have taken part in anti-tourist protests, some firing at guests with water pistols.⁠
⁠
Rallies calling for an end to mass tourism have been held elsewhere too, as visitor numbers soar in familiar spots in Europe. ⁠
⁠
But holidaymakers ought to be a gift to the cities and countries they visit.⁠
⁠
Indeed, officials in central banks and finance ministries quietly welcome the inflows, even as politicians are being pushed by voters to soak tourists (with taxes) and limit arrival numbers.⁠
⁠
The problem is that while higher tax receipts offer diffuse benefits, the costs of tourism are concentrated. Tap the link in our bio to discover how holiday hotspots can manage a tourism boom while also keeping locals happy.⁠

"As Joe Biden’s vice-president, Kamala Harris is in essence running as an incumbent. She will inherit his weaknesses, which Republicans are more than ready to exploit. That is most evident on immigration. ⁠
⁠
In 2016 Mr Trump manufactured a border crisis to whip up fear and loathing. But now the crisis is real: migrant encounters at America’s southern border have surged during the Biden administration. There were nearly 2.5m apprehensions at the border in fiscal year 2023, a record, although encounters have fallen by more than half since their peak in December.⁠
⁠
In 2021 Mr Biden tasked Ms Harris with looking at the “root causes” of migration in Central America. Republicans have interpreted this broadly, dubbing her the administration’s “border tsar” and placing the blame for high levels of migration at her feet. One of the biggest challenges of her campaign will be countering these claims, and persuading voters that she has a plan to fix the problem.⁠
⁠
So far that plan is elusive. Tap the link in our bio to learn what Ms Harris’s record might reveal about her immigration policy.⁠

"Kadena Air Base in Japan, America’s largest in the Pacific, is roughly 650km from the coast of China as the missile flies. American forces there have, in effect, been on a peacetime footing since the end of the Vietnam war.⁠
⁠
That’s about to change. Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary, announced on Sunday that he will create a new warfighting command to oversee all American forces in Japan.⁠
⁠
The “historic” shift, as American officials describe it, is a sign of the alarm with which America and Japan regard the threat from China, which is rapidly building up its armed forces.⁠
⁠
The move may deepen China’s worries about encirclement and intensify complaints that America is trying to build an “Asian NATO”. But tap the link in our bio to learn why that is a long way from reality.⁠

"America’s military position is eroding. That is the message of a report published by a bipartisan commission entrusted by Congress with scrutinising the Biden administration’s national defence strategy.⁠
⁠
In 2018 the previous such commission had warned that America “might struggle to win, or perhaps lose, a war against China or Russia”. ⁠
⁠
This time the language is starker. The threats to America, including “the potential for near-term major war”, are the most serious since 1945, it says. The country is both unaware of their extent and unprepared to meet them.⁠

But technologies tend to spread in less dramatic ways, task by task rather than role by role. Before machines replace individuals, they change the nature of the work they do—and that is likely to affect job satisfaction.⁠

It resurfaced in the days after Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, but this video has a twist. The song “Von dutch”, by a British pop star, Charli XCX, begins to rev in the background. Ms Harris’s signature belly laugh rises up. A lime-green filter with the word “brat”—the cover art and name of XCX’s new album—flashes across the screen.⁠

The video has 4m views—not counting millions from reshares and copycat remixes that have since spawned across social media. On the day Mr Biden dropped out of the race XCX gave Ms Harris her endorsement on X: “kamala IS brat”.⁠

"Last month Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron agreed that a “strategic agenda” document, drawn up to set the EU’s priorities for the next five years, was inadequate. But the German and French leaders’ extensive rewrites, drawn up just before an EU meeting, sparked a revolt among the other leaders. The pair retreated in humiliation. ⁠

They had failed the most elementary test of the European Council: avoid springing surprises on your colleagues.⁠

The story would be just one data point in the EU’s long history of communiqué contretemps if it did not highlight a worrying trend. For if Mr Macron is no coalition-builder, Germany, the EU’s biggest economy and most populous member, is supposed to be different. ⁠

"“The Olympics have always been about more than just sport,” writes David Goldblatt. “Since 1896 they have been staged as a cosmopolitan festival that sends a message to humanity.”⁠

"Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, was brimming with confidence when his government unveiled an interim budget in February. ⁠
⁠
His ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was widely expected to retain, and possibly expand, its parliamentary majority in the election.⁠
⁠
Such was his sureness of victory that his mini-budget at the time contained few of the welfare handouts and other sops that often precede elections in the country. ⁠

But after the BJP lost its majority, Mr Modi has had to compromise, and make trade-offs he is unaccustomed to making. ⁠

"In 1980 a local radio station in New York gave Ruth Westheimer, a sex therapist, 15 minutes after midnight on Sunday for “Sexually Speaking”.⁠

In a year it was an hour-long phone-in with as many as 653 calls, of which she could answer only 20 or 30.⁠

In 1984 “The Dr Ruth Show” aired on TV. From then on she was never idle. She had one mission: to promote sexual literacy so that Americans could talk freely and frankly about penises and vaginas, what felt good and where, and what they wanted more of.⁠

"Israel has justified its control over the territories it captured in 1967 with a combination of historic, legal, diplomatic and security arguments.⁠
⁠
On the basis of these arguments Israel annexed east Jerusalem and has kept the West Bank under military occupation for almost six decades. During this time it has allowed—and often encouraged and enabled—more than 700,000 Israelis to settle in the occupied territories.⁠
⁠
In an advisory opinion the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has rejected all of Israel’s legal claims, however. ⁠
⁠
The bottom line, according to the judges, is that “Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful” and that it is “under an obligation to cease immediately all new settlement activities” and evacuate the settlers already there.⁠

"“I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America,” Donald Trump declared early on in his nomination-acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention. ⁠

He had hinted beforehand that his remarks would offer an uncharacteristically unifying message—the barn-burner he had planned just wouldn’t work after his brush with death. ⁠
⁠
Though unusual for Mr Trump, rhetoric about bringing the country together has long been standard fare for more traditional American leaders. What set his remarks apart, and created one of the evening’s most dramatic moments, was when Mr Trump described in great detail the attempt on his life.⁠
⁠
The second two-thirds of the former president’s speech were particularly jarring. Although Mr Trump’s advisers had suggested that he wouldn’t even name Joe Biden during his remarks, he treated the final hour like a campaign speech, aiming jibes at his opponents. ⁠

Had the shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from a suburb of Pittsburgh, been a slightly better shot, America’s election would now look very different. ⁠

"For a long time, it seemed that a war of attrition between Ukraine and a Russia with five times its population could only end one way.⁠
⁠
But as Russian advances fizzle out the question now is less whether Ukraine can stay in the fight and more how long can Russia maintain its current tempo of operations.⁠
⁠
The key issue is not manpower. Instead, it is the country’s ability to replace its tanks, armoured infantry vehicles and artillery⁠

Russia has hitherto been able to keep pace with its losses by drawing out of storage and refurbishing stocks built up in the Soviet era. Huge though these supplies are, they are not infinite. ⁠

"Technologists tend to view contemporary schooling as a dinosaur, a compromise between efficiency and quality that worked long ago but which looks rickety now.⁠
⁠
Teachers with classes of 30 or so students inevitably end up having to spend much of their time delivering material at a speed and level of difficulty that only suits an average child. At the end of the school year, everyone advances even if they have not reached grade level. ⁠
⁠
Advocates have long promised that technology can upend this “assembly line” system of schooling and create a more “personalised” approach, allowing every pupil to learn at their own pace.⁠
⁠
But many traits of schooling, such as bells and age-graded classes, have outlasted more exciting ideas because, put simply, they work.⁠

"The Labour Party’s thumping victory in Britain’s general election seems to have “bucked the trend of declining support for social-democratic parties, particularly in the face of fervour for the populist right”, writes Claire Ainsley.⁠
⁠
In a guest essay for The Economist, she argues, however, that it is “vital to understand why and how Labour won, before taking any comfort that this marks the start of the centre-left’s comeback.”⁠
⁠
For the global centre-left, not least America’s Democrats as they approach the election in November, “it is critical to draw the right conclusions” from Labour’s successful turnaround.⁠

"Electricity markets must match supply and demand at every moment. The power that consumers use must always, second-by-second, be the same as the amount produced.⁠
⁠
Demand for electricity, known as “load”, is lowest at night and highest in the early evening, as people return from work and turn on lights and appliances. ⁠
⁠
Solar energy is changing the supply and demand calculation for electricity grids. Panels are most productive in the middle of the day, when the sun is highest; they generate very little power once it sets. ⁠
⁠
So instead of serving the total amount of load, ensuring there is sufficient generation to meet demand, grid operators need to concern themselves with the “net load”, or the electricity which solar power cannot provide. ⁠
⁠
Plot this net load against the hours of the day and, as this chart shows, it looks like a duck, its belly lying low in the water during the sunniest part of the day while in the evenings its neck rises rapidly. The more solar power on a grid, the faster other sources of supply must be added in the evenings to meet this peak load.⁠

The president certainly looked better than he did in the debate. Though he coughed several times, he seemed to gain momentum and energy as briefing went on. Rather than pale and sickly, he sported a tan and was more lively, despite frequently stumbling over his words.⁠

"In markets it is known as the “Trump trade”, a bet that Donald Trump’s return to the White House would herald more inflation and higher interest rates. ⁠

"Justice Sonia Sotomayor was correct to observe that historical evidence from America’s early republic “cuts decisively against” the Supreme Court’s presidential-immunity doctrine, writes Eric Nelson in a guest essay for The Economist.⁠
⁠
But is this, as she goes on to claim, because the decision converts the president into a “king above the law”?⁠

A traditional understanding of the American founding, Nelson explains, suggests the patriots in 1776 rebelled against royal power and, as a result, uniformly approached the design of their new executive in the 1780s “with a deep-seated, anti-monarchical sentiment”.⁠

"If Joe Biden and Donald Trump have one thing in common, it is that they don’t trust the polls.⁠
⁠
During the Republican primary Mr Trump referred to polls that showed his opponent Nikki Haley too close for comfort as “just another scam”. Now Mr Biden has cast doubt on polls that show him trailing Mr Trump in swing states or plagued by historically low approval ratings.⁠
⁠
Public ones suggest that on average the president’s polling deficit has increased by 1.7 points since the debate. That sounds modest, but Mr Trump’s lead now equals the largest he has had in any of his three presidential campaigns.⁠
⁠
Unfortunately for Democrats who would like to identify the most electable alternative to Mr Biden, recent polls will offer few clear answers. Tap the link in our bio to learn why—and to find out what the polls say about Kamala Harris, the vice-president.⁠

Its majority is the largest won by any government since 1997. The party flipped seats in all corners of Britain, defeating Conservative candidates in constituencies that had been blue since the 19th century.⁠

Yet this was not a popular triumph. In absolute numbers, the party attracted fewer ballots than it did under Jeremy Corbyn in 2019. Labour's share of the vote, at 34%, is the lowest level for a governing party since 1923.⁠

Instead of inspiring the masses, Sir Keir spearheaded a fearsomely efficient election-winning machine: it won 42 seats in Parliament for every 1m ballots cast, higher than any other major party in the past century. ⁠

The left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), dominated by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, looks poised to become the biggest bloc in parliament after final-round voting at legislative elections closed.⁠

"Ursula von der Leyen, boss of the European Commission, has postponed the publication of a heat-pump action plan. ⁠
⁠
This is a blow to the EU Green Deal, the union’s strategy to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Without a big push for cleaner heating, the EU is liable to miss its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. ⁠
⁠
Though decarbonising heating can be contentious among the public, EU leaders have supported it—with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Fifteen member states wrote to the commission in mid-May to lament the postponement of the launch of the heat-pump plan.⁠

"China’s small, rural banks provide a complex problem. Many have long been mismanaged. Those stuck with toxic debts can hurt local economic growth. ⁠
⁠
The worst-performing have already threatened social stability, the main concern of Xi Jinping, China’s leader. But state intervention is risky. ⁠
⁠
One solution has been making small, feeble institutions disappear by absorbing them into bigger ones. ⁠

This regulatory vanishing act will probably pick up pace. Supporters say that fewer bigger banks will be easier for regulators to keep watch over. Critics argue that it is little more than sleight of hand. ⁠

Yet Mr Obama’s tenure turned out to be not a break with the past, but merely a brief respite from it. The two subsequent presidents, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, were both also born in the 1940s. ⁠

He is right. NATO has helped keep the peace in Europe for 75 years, a stunning achievement after the continent’s centuries of war. But even though the alliance has much to celebrate, next week’s summit will not be a happy anniversary.⁠

Extreme political parties are in the ascendancy in France, writes Pascal Cagni in a guest essay for The Economist.⁠

Marine Le Pen’s hard-right National Rally (RN), which took the biggest share of the votes in the first round of the snap election, “promotes ‛national preference’ for French citizens in housing, jobs, and benefits, and for French companies in procurement”.⁠
⁠
But while some foreign investors may be dismayed by this political uncertainty, “they should not be deterred”. ⁠
⁠
“Whatever the outcome of the second round, the EU’s economic rules will serve as a safeguard against domestic political extremism,” Mr Cagni writes.⁠

“An RN government could challenge some EU policies, but the idea that they will be largely discarded is far-fetched.” ⁠

Labour is on track to win a historic landslide victory an exit poll suggests taking back swathes of seats in the Midlands the north of England and Scotland 

The poll suggests that the party will win 410 out of 650 seats in the House of Commons 

That would give Sir Keir Starmer the Labour leader a thumping majority of 170 just shy of the landslide won by Sir Tony Blair in 1997

"It has been a particularly busy term for America’s Supreme Court. Big decisions have arrived on guns, abortion, homelessness, presidential power—and more.⁠

The long­-developing deregulatory goal of the conservative legal movement has had a banner year—a trajectory that would probably be supercharged if Donald Trump wins a second presidential term.⁠

And the chances of another four years for Mr Trump improved when the six conservative justices gave the candidate something approaching a stay­-out-­of-­jail card in a case concerning presidential immunity.⁠

A dangerous conflagration with Hizbullah looms. An outright war could be one of the biggest conflicts in the region for decades. ⁠

The threat from Hizbullah is not new, but it is more serious than it was. Another war now would be disastrous for Israel. That means it should seek to build deterrence. ⁠

"The West’s relations with countries in the Sahel seemed to have hit rock bottom in May when Niger ordered America to withdraw its forces by September—having already booted out a French counter-terrorism mission—and welcomed Russian military advisers. Then even this bottom fell out.⁠
⁠
Last month Niger, which supplies about a quarter of Europe’s uranium, revoked the mining licence of France’s state-owned nuclear fuel company. Many fear the country will now hand over the rights to one of the world’s biggest uranium mines to a Russian state-owned firm.⁠
⁠
Niger’s turn against the West comes amid what many in French-speaking west Africa are calling a second “independence”. It is being spurred by a new generation of nationalists who have taken power in former French colonies from Senegal to Chad and the three core countries of the Sahel: Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.⁠

West Africa’s new nationalism is inchoate, sometimes contradictory, and vulnerable to authoritarian drift. But it would be a mistake to assume that its standard-bearers are unbending ideologues destined for Russia’s orbit. Click on the link in our bio to learn why.⁠

Since 2020, 17 states have adopted mandates that make taking a financial-literacy course a requirement for high-school graduation, bringing the total up to 25. And that figure will probably grow. ⁠

Pupils in these classes learn not only how to buy and sell shares, but how to save their earnings in order to have something to invest in the first place. Courses teach how to properly bank, budget, manage credit and pay for college. They cover comparison shopping and the basics of how to plan and track daily expenses.⁠

Young people badly need these courses. According to one international survey, only 10% of 15-year-olds in the OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, score highly on financial-literacy assessments. ⁠

It now stands at 61%. That is astonishing dominance for a country which accounts for just over a quarter of global GDP. ⁠

The extent of market concentration is all the more extreme given what is happening within the American stockmarket itself. Just three companies—Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia—make up a tenth of the market value of global stocks.⁠

"In politics, fringe ideas can become mainstream and vice versa. The “window of political possibility” can expand or move, as Joe Overton, an American political analyst, once put it. The same is true even in communist China. ⁠
⁠
On the face of it, the range of permissible economic opinion within Chinese officialdom is narrow. Indeed, some critics of China’s economic model worry that its president, Xi Jinping, operates in an information bubble.⁠
⁠
But on a number of issues, including the woes of private enterprise, the shortfall of consumption and the need for social spending, some advisers are surprisingly frank.⁠

"In December Jack Smith tried to get the Supreme Court to quickly take up the question of whether Donald Trump was immune from prosecution for allegedly attempting to subvert the results of the election in 2020.⁠
⁠
The charges, wrote the special counsel (an independent prosecutor appointed by the Department of Justice), “implicate a central tenet of our democracy”. The court's ruling no doubt disappointed him, and pleased Mr Trump. ⁠
⁠
Although the decision in Trump v United States does not give Mr Trump everything he asked for, it is a clear practical victory for the once and possibly future president. The charges against him for allegedly trying to thwart his electoral loss in 2020 will almost certainly not proceed before the election in November—and maybe not ever.⁠

"Queues of idle trucks trying to enter America are standard fare at Mexico’s border. Recently, however, vehicles at the Otay Mesa crossing, which separates California and the city of Tijuana, have been lining up to get into Mexico. ⁠

The trucks do not travel far—they offload their shipping containers in newly built warehouses just 15km south of the border. The goods are then separated into thousands of small packages and driven back to America.⁠

Although such imports are made in China and purchased in America, no tariffs are paid. Call it the Tijuana two-step.⁠

The two-step is a way in which some retailers make use of a loophole in American trade rules known as the “de minimis” exemption, which means “too small to be trifled with” and allows packages worth less than $800 to enter America without facing duties.⁠

"Earlier this year American officials began to talk about Russian plans to place a nuclear weapon in space. This was motivated by a Russian satellite which is thought to be secretly testing the necessary electronics some 2,000km above Earth’s surface. ⁠

A nuclear detonation there would probably be too high to wreak any meaningful direct damage on the surface of Earth. But it could cause what an outgoing official with America’s Defence Threat Reduction Agency calls a “satellite Armageddon”.⁠

Many of the nearby spacecraft tightly packed in lower orbits would be immediately fried; a greater number farther afield would slowly succumb to the radioactive aftermath. The blast would affect all countries’ satellites indiscriminately.⁠

"Mpox is a viral infection typically found in parts of Africa and spread through contact with infected animals as well as within households. ⁠
⁠
It causes severe fever, flu-like symptoms and a rash of pus-filled blisters across the body. In 2022 the disease, formerly known as monkeypox, spread around the world—cases turned up everywhere from Nigeria to America and Australia. ⁠
⁠
A newly discovered strain of the virus, described by some researchers as the most dangerous yet, now threatens to spread beyond the Democratic Republic of Congo into neighbouring countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.⁠
⁠
Although much remains unknown about this strain, Jean Claude Udahemuka, a lecturer at the University of Rwanda who has been studying the outbreak, reports fatality rates of approximately 5% in adults and 10% in children.⁠

"Feeling hungry? ⁠
⁠
Americans can now get a sandwich, fries, chicken nuggets and soft drink at McDonald’s for just $5. Burger King is matching the offer with a $5 meal deal of its own. The two are following in the footsteps of Wendy’s, which is temporarily adding an ice cream to its long-standing Biggie Bag combo.⁠
⁠
The food fight is a return to normality for an industry defined by high volumes and low margins. To make a buck, fast-food chains need to attract vast numbers of value-conscious, typically low-income diners.⁠
⁠
Yet in recent years rising incomes and surging inflation have given these burger joints a reason to supersize prices. The cost of a McDonald’s meal has risen by 40% since 2019, compared with a 19% rise in consumer prices more broadly.⁠

"For most people in Belgorod, the war started on December 30th, 2023—almost two years after it started in Ukraine. ⁠

That day the centre of the city was hit by a Ukrainian rocket, killing 25 civilians, including two children, and wounding more than a hundred. ⁠
⁠
Since then the border city and the province that surrounds it have been attacked almost daily. ⁠

Some 200 civilians have died and 800 have been wounded. Small numbers compared with what Ukraine has endured; but far more than anywhere else in Russia.⁠

“In that sense Mr Putin is fomenting a revolution: using the strategy and tactics of revolution against the Western system. His war against Ukraine is inextricably linked to the strategic objective of his revolution.”⁠

"No ethics committee would let researchers trap millions of children indoors for months, just to test the effects on their eyesight. ⁠

Yet China’s strict zero­-covid rules—notably a nationwide lockdown that closed many schools between January and May 2020—created just such a scenario.⁠
⁠
After pandemic lockdowns ended, mass eye tests in several Chinese cities detected spikes in rates of childhood myopia, or fuzzy sight at a distance. More than half of Chinese children and adolescents are now short­-sighted. ⁠

Joe Biden is betting that huge subsidies for new factories will transform the outlook for America’s workers—and November’s election. Donald Trump, Mr Biden’s rival, is just as eager to get more wrenches into the hands of American workers, mostly by slapping tariffs on foreign goods. ⁠

To call them “warriors” is not simply to insist their cause was just and that they were somehow tricked into entering the Capitol with the guns, bats, knives and other weapons that Mr Trump once maintained they did not have; it is not just to ignore or minimise the violence that day, which resulted in five deaths; it is not even to shift the blame for that violence to others.⁠

"At Kitt Peak National Observatory, in Arizona, a telescope has spent three years building a three-dimensional map of the heavens. ⁠
⁠
In examining the light from tens of millions of galaxies, the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) may have found something astounding.⁠
⁠
DESI is a tool meant to investigate the nature of dark energy, a mysterious entity that accounts for 68% of the energy in the universe and which pushes space apart in a repulsive version of gravity. ⁠
⁠
Though they do not know what it is, scientists have hitherto assumed that its density has been the same since the start of the universe, 13.7bn years ago. But DESI’s initial results suggest that this assumption may have been wrong. ⁠

Perhaps, say scientists, the density of dark energy has been changing over time. But nobody knows why, explains an expert involved with the work. Tap the link in our bio to learn why—if the findings prove to be true—it would catapult cosmology into a crisis.⁠

"Historians have often viewed slavery as the business of men. Research published last month shatters that narrative.⁠
⁠
Economists at Ohio State University analysed data from the New Orleans slave market, the biggest of them all, to quantify women’s role. They found that women were buyers or sellers in 30% of all transactions and 38% of those that involved female slaves.⁠
⁠
These are the first hard numbers, building on a growing body of qualitative work by Stephanie Jones-Rogers, a historian at the University of California, Berkeley, showing just how instrumental women were to the slave economy. ⁠

For the ladies of the antebellum South, slavery was more than business—it was their ticket to economic autonomy. Coverture laws compelled women to relinquish property and money to men when they married, but exceptions were made for slaves.⁠

"It may not measure up to Napoleon’s march on Moscow in 1812, but Emmanuel Macron’s decision to call a parliamentary election this month is looking like one of the most self­-destructive gambles by a French leader in modern times. ⁠

After seven years under the president’s centrist government, voters’ judgment threatens to be severe. It may well plunge France into a political, and perhaps even economic, crisis.⁠
⁠
As for Mr Macron, he will remain in office; his term does not expire until 2027. But he will have little choice but to offer the job of prime minister to the nominee of whichever party or alliance comes top. ⁠

At the height of the civil war that followed America’s invasion in 2003, as many as 80 people suffered violent deaths every day.⁠

That trauma is evident in much of the country’s recent literature: in some novels, corpses have a leading role.⁠

Yet the country is also heir to a great cultural legacy. It was in Mesopotamia, the land that became modern-day Iraq, that the first cities appeared some 5,000 years ago.⁠

The problem is that both treatments have “affordability issues”. ⁠

"The history of leveraged finance—the business of lending to risky, indebted companies—is best told in three acts. ⁠

High-yield (or “junk”) bonds were the subject of the first. That ended in 1990 when Michael Milken, the godfather of this sort of debt, was sent to prison for fraud.⁠
⁠
In the second act, the extraordinary growth of private equity was financed by both junk bonds and leveraged loans, which require companies to pay a floating rate of interest rather than the fixed coupons on most bonds. ⁠
⁠
Private-credit investors are now supplying the third wave of money. When interest rates rose in 2022 and banks stopped underwriting new risky loans, private credit became the only game in town. Wall Street chattered that its “golden age” had begun.⁠

"Colombia’s first avowedly left-wing president came to power in August 2022 promising to reduce inequality in one of the world’s most unequal countries. Since taking office Gustavo Petro has been pushing through a series of reforms in pursuit of this goal.⁠
⁠
But almost two years into his term, the bills underpinning his signature reforms have stalled. There is opposition in Congress and on the streets.⁠
⁠
Violence and corruption scandals are eroding what political capital the government has left. Shoot-outs and kidnappings are increasing in the country’s south, undermining Mr Petro’s campaign promise to bring “total peace”.⁠
⁠
Mr Petro is trying to deliver his agenda by becoming more combative. But he needs to negotiate with Congress and placate protesters in order to successfully reform Colombia’s welfare system. ⁠

"Transnistria and Moldova exist in a surreal symbiosis. Most Moldovans have little emotional attachment to it—but the war in Ukraine has kick-started the process of reintegrating the pro-Russian enclave.⁠
⁠
The reintegration of Transnistria into Moldova would mean importing a largely pro-Russian voting bloc into the politics of a country that has annoyed Vladimir Putin by being a candidate to join the EU. ⁠
⁠
Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Transnistrians’ fears that their strip of land might become a new front in that war have been very real. ⁠

"“Democracies are being torn apart by extremism and polarisation,” writes Yair Zivan in a guest essay for The Economist.⁠
⁠
“The gains made by the far right in the European parliamentary elections in recent days are only the latest sign of the rising dangers of populism,” the author warns.⁠
⁠
Elsewhere, “the political discourse pushed by illiberal leaders labels opponents as enemies and traitors. Proponents of illiberal democracy in countries like Hungary and Turkey systematically undermine the institutions which hold liberal democracy together.”⁠
⁠
But “denouncing extremist politicians as racists or neo-fascists does nothing to address the source of their appeal”, Mr Zivan points out. ⁠
⁠
“At a time when politics can feel bleak and when politicians trade in fear and anger,” centrism offers a “sense of hope”. To learn why the author believes that is now “needed more than ever”, tap the link in our bio.⁠

"It was meant to be a big show, a historic conference on the 500th day of the war, and one that might just end it. But from the very start Volodymyr Zelensky’s Global Peace Summit has run into problems.⁠
⁠
Delayed five times, it was finally scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, respectively days 843 and 844 of the conflict. ⁠
⁠
The initial idea of the summit was to forge a unified proposal based on Mr Zelensky’s ten-point “peace formula”, dating back to 2022; and then to present it to Russia. ⁠
⁠
But three thornier issues from the formula—reparations, war tribunals and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine—will not feature on the expected communiqué from the conference.⁠

In fact, it might be that women returning to work after childbirth can afford to relax. ⁠

"The votes had not all been counted on a bright morning in 1997 before John Major resigned as prime minister of Britain and headed to the Oval in London to watch a game of cricket. ⁠

It was clear to him then that his party had been skittled: nearly a third of the Conservative cabinet had been swept away overnight in what would become the Tories’ worst performance in the modern democratic era. ⁠

Next month the Conservatives may get an even bigger battering. Our prediction model currently has them holding onto 187 seats, half the number they won in 2019. And as predictions go, that is among the more generous.⁠

Britain’s winner-takes-all electoral system offers little in the way of a “floor” when a major party suffers an ignominious collapse. Pollsters say there is a tipping-point, at around 25% of the vote, below which scores of usually safe seats are at risk.⁠

An estimated 85 colleges in America are affiliated with some form of senior living.⁠

With more than 10,000 baby-boomers in America turning 65 every day, and more set to hit that milestone this year than ever before, the opportunity for alternative forms of retirement is large.

"For years European authorities have worried that a drug epidemic on the scale of America’s opioid crisis would arrive at the continent’s shores. Drugs like fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin, are estimated to kill around 70,000 Americans every year.⁠
⁠
Europe has, so far, managed to escape fentanyl’s grip. But their uptake is greater in some European countries than others.⁠
⁠
This year’s report by the EU’s European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction shows where drug overdoses are estimated to be happening most frequently, and the extent to which opioids are responsible.⁠
⁠
Based on the information available, the report found that opioids (usually taken with other substances) are the most common cause of drug-induced deaths in the EU. In 2022 they were responsible for more than three-quarters of fatal overdoses. In Denmark, Austria and Bulgaria, opioids—including heroin and synthetic forms—made up more than 90% of all drug-related deaths, as this map shows.⁠

"Debates about teenagers’ access to phones and their use in schools have heated up lately. ⁠
⁠
Some state legislatures in America are passing laws to stop phones from being used in classrooms, without removing them from schools altogether. “The Anxious Generation”, by Jonathan Haidt, has called fresh attention to evidence that social media, mostly accessed through smartphones, may be to blame for a sharp rise in anxiety, depression and self-harm among young people today.⁠
⁠
Most parents want their children to have phones available at school, in case of emergency. But the devices are plainly disruptive, and can even undermine learning. An all-day ban is one way to avoid this, but it is difficult to enforce.⁠

"Ship christenings are not short of pomp and circumstance. The naming ceremony for Queen Anne, a new ship owned by Cunard, a British cruise line, was no exception. ⁠
⁠
Earlier this month officials in civic regalia joined crowds in Liverpool, Cunard’s one-time home. Mel C, a member of the Spice Girls, flashed peace signs; Andrea Bocelli, an Italian opera singer, performed alongside an orchestra.⁠
⁠
There were confetti cannon, prolonged blasts of the horn and the smashing of a 12-litre Laurent-Perrier champagne bottle against the ship. ⁠
⁠
The maiden voyage of Queen Anne, whose 3,000 passengers can take part in yoga, cinema screenings and ballroom dancing, is well-timed. Cruisers from Britain and Ireland booked 2.3m trips in 2023, an increase of 14.5% on 2019, according to a trade body. ⁠

"Last year almost 16m guns were sold in the United States. People buying a gun must fill in a seven-page federal form. Question 21f asks: “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana” (or any other illegal drug)? Almost certainly hundreds of thousands of people lie on the form, which is a felony. In a typical year, fewer than 300 are prosecuted. ⁠

This year Hunter Biden became one of them. On Tuesday the president’s wayward son was convicted on all three charges against him.⁠

Americans remain, at least outwardly, upbeat when it comes to the prospects for a deal. Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, arrived in the region this week to promote the ceasefire agreement presented by Joe Biden.⁠

Hamas, he said, had proposed “numerous” changes, but some of them were “workable”. He argued that the gaps between the two sides were “bridgeable”.⁠

Peter Navarro, a leading economic adviser in Mr Trump’s first administration, is more than halfway through a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress. He bristles with indignation at the justice system, disdains Joe Biden’s record and longs to steer America towards hardline protectionism. ⁠

In written correspondence with The Economist, Mr Navarro has laid out how he thinks the former president should approach trade if he is re-elected—from turning up the heat on China to slapping tariffs on just about everyone else. It is a dark, angry vision for the global economy. But as polls stand, it is one Mr Navarro may shortly be able to promote from inside the White House.⁠

"Emmanuel Macron is nothing if not a risk-taker. His most recent political gamble—to dissolve the National Assembly and hold snap elections—puts his credibility and authority on the line for the three years that remain of his second term in office. ⁠
⁠
Mr Macron’s decision was a response to crushing results for his party, Renaissance, at elections to the European Parliament. The party garnered just half of the share of the vote secured by Marine Le Pen’s hard-right party, National Rally.⁠
⁠
The president’s calculation seems to be that, at some point, he was likely to face an irresistible political demand for fresh parliamentary elections. By dissolving parliament now, Mr Macron has at least made the choice his, and controlled the timing. ⁠
⁠
But more than this, he is hoping for what an adviser calls a “moment of clarification”. To learn what this would look like, and why it is far from clear whether he will have success, tap the link in our bio.⁠

Any further rise in sea levels threatens coastal properties and the livelihoods and lifestyles of coastal communities, as well as the very existence of low-lying countries. Rising seas not only erode or flood land, they also lead destructive storms to reach ever further inland.⁠

The Ukrainians are also now to be allowed to use some American kit to hit Russian forces on the other side of the border attacking or preparing to attack Kharkiv.⁠

"Twenty years ago Joshua Cooper Ramo, a consultant, first wrote about the “Beijing consensus”. The Washington consensus of financial liberalisation, floating currencies and openness to foreign capital was, he posited, a damaged brand. China was pioneering its own approach to development based on principles of equality, innovation and a relentless focus on sovereignty and national security. This would appeal to lots of developing countries. ⁠
⁠
Xi Jinping has since argued in a speech to Communist Party officials that China’s economic model “breaks the myth that modernisation equals Westernisation”, and that its growth was expanding “choices for developing countries”. ⁠
⁠
Leaders past and present in the developing world—from Pakistan’s Imran Khan and Malaysia’s Mahathir Mohamad to Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa—have expounded the benefits of at least some aspects of the model.⁠

Economic growth is the only way to keep living standards rising over the long haul. But British politicians also obsess over it for another reason: an expanding economy is what keeps their tax-and-spending plans credible. ⁠

Ahead of the general election, Britain’s main parties have signed up to a fiscal rule that requires government debt to fall as a percentage of GDP between the fourth and fifth year of the forecast period.⁠
⁠
Both Labour and the Conservatives have ruled out big new tax rises if they are elected and have said they won’t rejig the rules to permit more borrowing. Voters have little appetite for spending cuts to already-frayed public services. ⁠

"Nvidia, Amazon and Alphabet have made traditional valuation measures look hopelessly outdated. ⁠
⁠
Dividend yields, for instance, were once a popular tool for assessing prospective returns. But Amazon has never made such a payout and Alphabet will make its first ever later this month (of 20 cents per $175 share). Nvidia’s quarterly dividend after its split on Friday will be just one cent per share, each priced at around $120. ⁠
⁠
Plainly, there is no stretch of the imagination by which these payouts explain the stocks’ spectacular returns. The stage is, therefore, set for the revival of a fierce argument. ⁠
⁠
Low yields might mean that dividends will rise, or that future returns will be poor. Reams of academic research suggest that, historically and for the stockmarket as a whole, they have portended poor returns. ⁠
⁠
Even so, a school of thought has stubbornly held that investors know what they are doing, and if they are buying stocks that yield little, they must expect payouts to grow. Of late, hewing to this school and buying the likes of Alphabet, Amazon and Nvidia would have made you a lot richer than fretting about valuations. So could it be correct after all?⁠

"Neither Rishi Sunak nor Sir Keir Starmer is a natural politician. Extreme events in British politics elevated both to a high place and now the general election is putting all their flaws and frailties on display. ⁠
⁠
Rishi Sunak has two registers: simpering and hectoring. When members of the public laid out their hardship stories during a recent televised debate, he responded with the learned empathy of a man worth £651m ($830m). ⁠
⁠
Sir Keir, meanwhile, is remarkably wooden for a former barrister, clumsily dragging every other question back to his tenure running the Crown Prosecution Service. The viewer was left pleasantly surprised that anyone was jailed during his stint there.⁠
⁠
If each struggles with this format, why did both agree to it? One answer is that debates are now a mainstay of British politics, which has taken a presidential turn. ⁠
⁠
Combining the expectations of a president with the weaker powers of a prime minister is a bad mix. Tap the link in our bio to learn how weak politicians—such as these two—are exposing the absurdities of this accidental system.⁠

"In a village on the edge of the Taklamakan desert in the far-western region of Xinjiang, the “gongzuodui” has been busy. The term means “work team”. ⁠
⁠
In Xinjiang it refers to a group of officials dispatched to a poor rural area to change the way Muslim residents live and think. In this village, called Konabazar, the team has been engaged in “ideological mobilisation”. The aim is to persuade reluctant farmers to head off and do other forms of work.⁠
⁠
It is all but impossible for journalists to find out what those ethnic-Uyghur farmers made of the work team’s efforts, which involved lecturing villagers at flag-raising ceremonies and holding night-school classes. ⁠
⁠
Since early 2017, when China began sending a million or more people, most of them Uyghurs, to “vocational education and training centres” (detention camps, in effect), it has become increasingly difficult to get first-hand accounts from victims of China’s repression in Xinjiang. The state justifies its actions in the name of stamping out terrorism, separatism and religious extremism. ⁠
⁠
Western scholars believe the camps were wound down around 2020. But they say official accounts, such as the report about Konabazar, suggest widespread forced labour is still being used for a similar purpose.⁠

"Joe Biden’s plan to crack down on migration at America’s southern border is meant not necessarily to succeed, but to convince voters that he is trying to succeed. ⁠
⁠
On Tuesday the president revealed an executive order that will theoretically allow him to deny asylum to migrants who cross illegally when their number is high.⁠
⁠
The administration has been mulling executive action since Senate Republicans, at Donald Trump’s behest, torpedoed a bipartisan bill they’d helped craft. The order borrows ideas from that bill. ⁠
⁠
It would bar those who cross between ports of entry from receiving asylum when encounters of migrants at the southern border exceed an average of 2,500 a day—a threshold that would be easily met. Asylum-seekers would then be turned back into Mexico or deported until apprehensions fall below 1,500 a day.⁠

He implies that the current situation is even stickier. Britain, he says, is in economic, social and moral decline. Worse yet, the election is “boring”.⁠

To solve all of these problems he made an “Emergency General Election Announcement” on Monday. He is taking over as leader of Reform UK, and is standing for the party at the election in Clacton, a town on the east coast of England.⁠

"The three presiding judges wasted little time in presenting their verdicts in the case of the “Hong Kong 47”, members of the city’s pro-democracy political opposition. ⁠
⁠
Over the course of two minutes on May 30th, the justices declared 14 of the defendants guilty of conspiracy to commit subversion in the biggest national-security trial in the city’s history. Thirty-one had already pleaded guilty. Two were acquitted.⁠
⁠
The activists’ crime was to have held a primary election in 2020 to improve their chances of winning control of the local legislature. With that control, they planned to demand greater democracy—or else to oppose the government’s budget, which would have forced the city’s Beijing-backed chief executive to step down. ⁠
⁠
The authorities alleged that the scheme amounted to an illegal subversion of state power under a national-security law imposed by the central government. The defendants’ attorneys called it normal electoral politics.⁠
⁠
The election of 2020 was eventually postponed because of covid-19. In the interim, the 47 were arrested and the legislature was restructured to exclude those not deemed “patriots”. ⁠
⁠
The verdicts, which are likely to result in prison sentences, represent the ongoing strangulation of dissent in Hong Kong. Tap the link in our bio to read why.⁠

"While Joe Biden’s re-election campaign posts videos to his TikTok page cracking jokes about Donald Trump, viewers have their own gag: isn’t he trying to ban this app?⁠
⁠
The government says it is not banning TikTok but has given it an ultimatum: sell to a suitable non-Chinese owner by January or shut down. It deems TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese firm, to be controlled by a “foreign adversary” and to be a national-security threat. Politicians accuse China of using the app to steal Americans’ data and spread propaganda.⁠
⁠
TikTok denies these charges and is suing. So are its users. They argue that divestment is “simply not possible” (China could block it) and Congress is “singling out and banning TikTok”, in violation of the First Amendment rights of its 170m American users. ⁠
⁠
The dispute over whether the government can force TikTok to divest or shut down in America will probably reach the Supreme Court. In the meantime, the ramifications of the tussle are becoming clearer. And they go well beyond TikTok.⁠

Despite her request for “lesbian yoga boobs”—implying an unobtrusive size between an A and a B cup—the surgeon fit her with sizeable Ds. ⁠
⁠
She was irritated that her cups runneth over and lamented the presence of these “silicone aliens”, their bulk and lack of feeling, and how they changed her sense of her own personhood.⁠

What followed was a four-year quest to uncover the social and cultural significance of breasts. In her book “Tits Up”, Ms Thornton takes the reader to five places where women’s chests are revered: strip clubs, milk banks, operating rooms, lingerie ateliers and female spiritual gatherings.⁠

⁠
The African National Congress (ANC), which has governed since 1994, has been rejected by almost 60% of voters. ⁠

Since it will be unable to form a government of its own, to stay in power the ANC will have to enter a coalition with a big opposition party. The biggest danger is that it will do a deal with the Economic Freedom Fighters, a radical socialist and race-baiting party. ⁠

"The West’s baby-boomers are the richest generation ever to have lived—but they do not spend like it.⁠

Instead, the elderly are squirrelling away money. Whereas in the mid-1990s Americans aged between 65 and 74 spent 10% more than their income, the same age group has been a net saver, in aggregate, since 2015. A similar picture is found across the rich world, from Canada to Japan.⁠
⁠
That matters because retirees are so numerous and rich that their behaviour can drive capital markets. America’s boomers have a net worth of over $1m per person, for instance.⁠
⁠
For decades their saving for retirement has helped drive down interest rates, which in the long run must move to equilibrate savings and investment globally.⁠

A jury of Mr Trump’s peers weighed the evidence and unanimously convicted him of breaking election law by covering up payments of hush money to a porn star, Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with him. In itself the outcome would seem to vindicate a fundamental American principle, that no citizen is beyond the reach of justice. ⁠

"There was anticipation, there was exasperation at the wait, and then there it was: a guilty verdict against Donald Trump, delivered by a jury of 12 New Yorkers after two days of deliberation. In fact 34 guilty verdicts, all for falsifying business records. ⁠
⁠
Never before has a former American president been convicted of a crime. Nor has a major-party candidate sought the presidency with a felony record. The overriding question now is whether it will upset Mr Trump’s chances in this year’s race: if the election were held today, polls suggest, he would beat Joe Biden.⁠
⁠
The case concerned Mr Trump’s campaign in 2016, when his then lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid a porn star to keep her story of sex with the candidate out of the press. Mr Trump approved the hush-money deal and mislabelled his reimbursement to Mr Cohen as legal fees in his company’s books. Since Mr Cohen was repaid in monthly instalments, Alvin Bragg, Manhattan’s district attorney, brought 34 counts stemming from those falsely marked payments. ⁠
⁠
Despite the conviction, there are three reasons to think that the damage to Mr Trump will be limited and that he will weather it as he has so much else. Tap the link in our bio to learn what they are.⁠

"Reports of at least 45 dead in an Israeli air strike in Rafah on Sunday have provoked an international outcry. The strike took place two days after the International Court of Justice issued an order to halt any strikes in Rafah that “may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”.⁠
⁠
Israeli officials insisted that this meant they could continue operating in Rafah, as they were taking the necessary precautions to avoid harming Palestinian civilians. But even accepting that interpretation—and the Israeli Defence Forces’ claims that the strike was “accurate” and that it planned to avoid additional casualties—the gruesome outcome makes clear the human cost of Israel’s war in Gaza. ⁠

"An estimated 1m Palestinians have fled Rafah since the start of Israel’s offensive there in early May. For those who remain, the fighting has had grisly consequences.⁠
⁠
At least 45 people, including a number of children, died on Sunday after an Israeli air strike set fire to a tent camp; survivors had to pull charred bodies from the wreckage.⁠
⁠
Less macabre, but just as consequential, is what the offensive has done to the flows of aid that have kept 2.2m Palestinians alive throughout eight months of war.⁠
⁠
Consider the statistics from one recent day. The Israeli army said that 370 lorries of aid reached Gaza on Monday, 154 of them via Kerem Shalom, a border crossing in the south. Yet the UN’s official tally from that day recorded zero lorries at Kerem Shalom. Neither side is lying—nor, though, are they telling the whole truth.⁠

"As one of the leaders of the passive-investing revolution, BlackRock is usually a disruptive force in the financial world. But the asset-management giant’s battle with Saba Capital, an activist fund, has cast it in an unfamiliar role: as besieged incumbent. Ten of BlackRock’s investment vehicles, known as closed-end funds, are in Saba’s sights.⁠
⁠
In one sense, the battle is typical of those between activists and their targets. But in another sense, it represents a bigger struggle.⁠

The funds—worth nearly $10bn based on current share prices—run at a steep discount to the value of the assets in their portfolios. This markdown has long preoccupied some of finance’s best-known researchers. Persistent discounts, which closed-end funds tend to trade at, violate one of the fundamental assumptions of efficient financial markets: the law of one price. ⁠

"If current forecasts are accurate, 2064 will be the first year in centuries when fewer babies are born than people die. By 2100 the world’s fertility rate will hit 1.7. Just two Pacific islands and four African countries will manage to reproduce above replacement level.⁠
⁠
Sooner or later, therefore, every big economy will collide with a demographic wall. The bill from pensions and hospitals will pile on fiscal pressure. Sapped of workers and ideas, economic growth could collapse while public debt balloons. ⁠
⁠
Just how catastrophic the situation becomes depends on whether policymakers maintain budgetary discipline, withstand pressure from angry older voters and, crucially, are willing to inflict pain on populations now in order to save future generations from more later on. ⁠

"“First, we are named foreign influence agents, and then we are imprisoned like agents… This is a Russian playbook.”⁠

Earlier this month the Georgian government passed a law that will force NGOs and media organisations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as foreign agents. It caused a huge uproar: many believe it will enable the government to stifle opposition and strengthen ties with Russia. ⁠

"The diamond industry's most important company is facing the chop.⁠
⁠
After rejecting a takeover proposal from BHP, the world’s biggest miner, Anglo American announced a radical restructuring of its business. As well as selling its coal, nickel and platinum operations, the British mining firm will shed its 85% stake in De Beers.⁠
⁠
De Beers’s change of ownership marks the end of one of the company’s most enduring relationships—Ernest Oppenheimer, Anglo American’s founder, joined its board in 1926. For the industry, it signals the biggest shake-up since 2000, when De Beers abandoned its policy of controlling diamond prices by managing supply.⁠
⁠
Anglo could hardly have chosen a worse time to sell its diamond operation. De Beers’s revenue fell by a third last year and Anglo marked down the value of its investment by $1.6bn, to $7.6bn. More worrying still is the threat from man-made diamonds.⁠

New York, capital of the global art market, has become a hub for restitution efforts. If the city is filled with art dealers, Matthew Bogdanos, the head of the Antiquities Trafficking Unit (ATU), is the un­-dealer.⁠

"When “phone phreaks” tried to meddle with phone lines in the mid-1960s, the networks changed how the system worked by splitting the channel carrying the voice signal from the one managing the call. ⁠
⁠
One of these systems, SS7, became a global standard in 1980. But it was built on the basis of trust, not security—and has become woefully inadequate for the mobile age.⁠

Phones today are now dangerously vulnerable to hacking, and fixing the problem has not proven easy. ⁠

"NATO secretaries-general do not normally attack the policies of the alliance’s biggest and most important member country. But Jens Stoltenberg, whose ten-year stint in charge is coming to an end, has done just that. ⁠
⁠
In an interview with The Economist, he called on NATO allies supplying weapons to Ukraine to end their prohibition on using them to strike military targets in Russia. Mr Stoltenberg’s clear, if unnamed, target was the policy maintained by Joe Biden, America’s president, of controlling what Ukraine can and cannot attack with American-supplied systems.⁠
⁠
It has long been a source of frustration for Ukrainians that if they want to go after targets on Russian soil they must depend on home-produced drones, which have only limited utility. The justification for restrictions on the way in which Ukraine fights was always that America wanted to avoid prompting an escalatory response by Vladimir Putin, especially the use of tactical nuclear weapons. ⁠
⁠
While Mr Stoltenberg acknowledged the risk of escalation, he warns that Ukraine is struggling. To learn why he says the rules on using Western weapons should be eased, tap the link in our bio.⁠

"The Gaza war is a diplomatic disaster for Israel, a military quagmire and a human tragedy. In has stepped Karim Khan, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), who has accused Israel’s leaders of responsibility for starvation, murder and extermination. ⁠
⁠
He believes he is creating moral clarity, asserting the primacy of international law and thereby delivering justice. On all three counts he is likely to be disappointed.⁠
⁠
Israel has very probably failed to meet its obligations under the Geneva Convention of 1949, to provide food and medicine to civilians under its occupation “to the fullest extent of the means available to it”.⁠
⁠
However, it is a leap to go from this to asserting there is an intentional, systematic criminal scheme to starve civilians. That is the jump Mr Khan’s allegations make, and as a result they are both more serious and contestable. ⁠
⁠
The gravity of the claims and the fact that some countries dispute the legitimacy of the ICC make it essential that its prosecutor should meticulously calibrate his accusations and follow due process. By instead pursuing maximal claims against Israel’s leaders and short-circuiting procedure, the prosecutor of the ICC has brought a flawed case. ⁠

"Fertility rates are falling nearly everywhere. ⁠
⁠
The rich world faces a severe shortage of babies: the average woman in a high­-income country will have just 1.6 children in her lifetime. ⁠
⁠
As birth rates plunge, many politicians want to pour money into policies that might lead women to have more babies. Yet all these attempts are likely to fail, because they are built on a misapprehension.⁠
⁠
Governments’ concern is understandable: the decline in fertility over the past decade has been faster than demographers expected. ⁠
⁠
While the decision to have children is a personal one and should stay that way, governments should pay heed to rapid demographic shifts.⁠

But baby-­boosting policies are a costly and socially retrograde mistake, founded on a false diagnosis. Tap the link in our bio to discover why leaders should focus on adapting economies to baby busts instead.⁠

The rich world faces a severe shortage of babies the average woman in a highincome country will have just 16 children in her lifetime 

As birth rates plunge many politicians want to pour money into policies that might lead women to have more babies Yet all these attempts are likely to fail because they are built on a misapprehension

Governments concern is understandable the decline in fertility over the past decade has been faster than demographers expected 

While the decision to have children is a personal one and should stay that way governments should pay heed to rapid demographic shifts

But babyboosting policies are a costly and socially retrograde mistake founded on a false diagnosis Tap the link in our bio to discover why leaders should focus on adapting economies to baby busts instead

"It has been a bloody month for Mexico’s southern state of Chiapas. ⁠

Last week a candidate running in local elections next month was attacked, and five members of his team were shot dead. That came days after a mayoral candidate was killed with five others, and an apparent gang shoot-out in which 11 people died. ⁠

Murders in Chiapas rose by 60% in the first three months of this year, compared with the same period in 2023. The state typifies the insecurity under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and the government led by his Morena party at the end of his six-year term. ⁠

Israel recalled its ambassadors from all three countries in response; its foreign minister condemned the trio’s decision as a “distorted step” and said it was evidence, in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7th, that “terrorism pays”. ⁠

"Few Iranians will shed tears for Ebrahim Raisi, a vicious prosecutor in his youth and a vacuous president in his final years. Even Ali Khamenei seems eager to forget him, even though the supreme leader groomed him for decades. Still, the president’s death will shake the regime at a dangerous moment. ⁠

For years Mr Khamenei has narrowed the circle of power. Electoral politics, a feature of Iran since the revolution in 1979, have been squashed. ⁠

"A bullet-train line planned to run between Los Angeles and San Francisco is one of America’s most ambitious infrastructure projects in decades. ⁠
⁠
But the high-speed railway is better known for its ultra-low speed of development. California began planning it three decades ago. ⁠
⁠
In 2008, when the state’s voters approved nearly $10bn in bonds for the train, it was thought that the total cost would run to $33bn and that it would be done by 2020. Now California expects to spend up to $35bn plus another decade just to finish the middle section—171 miles from Bakersfield to Merced, the easiest terrain for building.⁠
⁠
Understandably, many in the state have given up on the bullet train. And while the past half-year has fuelled some optimism, obstacles big and small still stand in the way. Tap the link in our bio to learn what they are.⁠

The relationship continues to raise complex questions over the balance between prosperity and national security, openness and protectionism. ⁠

Additionally, this month the director of GCHQ, Britain’s signals-intelligence agency, said that it now devoted more resources to China “than any other single mission”. ⁠

Until recently, Turkish law decreed that women would have to take their fiancé’s surname on marriage, or double-barrel it with their maiden names.⁠
⁠
For many, the law was problematic. It meant changing security cards, passports, driving licences, bank cards as well as national IDs.⁠
⁠
But after being brought to Turkey’s constitutional court again and again, though, the court finally came down in favour of changing the law in April 2023.⁠

Although the old law has been repealed, parliament has not yet passed new legislation to replace it, leaving women who have married since January 29th find themselves in a legal grey zone—and an awkward situation.⁠

"Since the first iPhone landed in people’s pockets in 2007, apps have steadily become the portal of choice to the digital world. ⁠
⁠
The mobile devices on which they run now account for two-thirds of global web traffic. Inhabitants of rich countries spend about five hours a day, roughly a third of their waking lives, staring at apps. Globally some 3.5bn people use them each month.⁠
⁠
That has made the app stores that distribute them a lucrative business for Apple and Alphabet, the tech titans whose iOS and Android operating systems power the vast majority of mobile devices around the world. ⁠
⁠
Governments seeking greater control over the digital world are increasingly leaning on these gatekeepers to do so. But they are also working to loosen the duopoly’s stranglehold over the market. To learn why they risk irking consumers on both counts, tap the link in our bio.⁠

"Climate scientists say they are running out of adjectives to describe recent weather anomalies. ⁠
⁠
Last year was the hottest on record: the World Meteorological Organisation said that temperatures were roughly 1.45°C above pre-industrial levels. Samantha Burgess, the deputy director of the EU’s climate agency, said that the second half of 2023 had “truly been shocking”. ⁠

In June 2023 the world entered an “El Niño” phase, which can temporarily boost temperatures and cause extreme weather anomalies. But even by El Niño standards, the speed at which air temperatures rose in 2023 alarmed climate scientists. And this year is also breaking records.⁠

"The Great Barrier Reef is a natural marvel. Spanning 2,300km along the north-east coast of Australia, this vast ecosystem boasts hundreds of species of multicoloured corals across an area roughly the size of Italy. ⁠
⁠
Thousands of other marine species rely on it for their survival. But the rate at which Earth is warming leaves its future in doubt.⁠
⁠
This year’s southern-hemisphere summer is likely to have been the deadliest in the reef’s history. What made it so was the unprecedented thermal stress—a measure of both high temperatures and their duration—it endured.⁠

It will be months before the consequences are clear, but some corals are already succumbing. Up to half may die, estimates Neal Cantin of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. ⁠

There was less drama around the Israeli campaign in Zeitoun, in northern Gaza, which began days after the fighting in Rafah. ⁠

Instead there was a sense of déjà vu. Israel’s army fought there last year, at the start of this war, and returned for a two-week offensive in February. Now it is back for a third time, and perhaps not the last. ⁠

The twin campaigns say much about Israel’s faltering war effort. Hamas is trying to reassert control in other parts of Gaza—and eight months into the war, Israel has no plan for how to prevent that. ⁠

"The legal cannabis industry in America—indeed, worldwide—is barely a decade old. ⁠

This constitutes a colossal experiment. ⁠

"Countries thinking of copying Australia’s “news media bargaining code” should look at Canada’s experience, take their draft proposals, and spike them.⁠

The bargaining code, passed in 2021, obliged Google and Facebook to pay news outlets when search results or social-media feeds linked to their articles.⁠
⁠
The rationale was always dubious. Forcing one company to pay another for linking to its site undermines a basic principle of the internet, nor to mention free speech.⁠
⁠
Now the codes are backfiring. In Canada, which passed an Australian-style law last year, Facebook’s parent company, Meta, blocked news links from being shared on its platforms, rather than paying up.⁠

Another important factor is the extravagance involved in campaigning, which affects the type of people who are elected. Successful candidates tend to be wealthy.⁠

⁠
Most eye-poppingly, when describing the Russia-China relationship, the two leaders said it “has no limits, there are no ‘forbidden’ areas of co-operation”. Whether there are limits to China’s support of Russia is now the subject of intense scrutiny by the West. ⁠

"Venice has never been more full—or more empty. In 2022 the population of the island city dropped below 50,000, down from 175,000 in 1951. But as residents leave, tourists flow in. ⁠
⁠
As many as 30m people visit every year, most for day trips, and crowd the historic city’s eight square kilometres. They rarely visit cultural sites: only around 360,000 go to the Gallerie dell’Accademia, one of the city’s major art museums. Officials complain of “hit-and-run” tourists who come for a few hours, dump their rubbish, then go home.⁠
⁠
So the city has introduced the tourism equivalent of a short-stay parking fare. Venice has started charging an “access fee” of €5 ($5.4) to day-trippers, becoming the first city in the world to do so.⁠

"The BJP, India’s ruling party, faces a succession problem. ⁠
⁠
Narendra Modi, the prime minister, is its greatest asset: around a third of those who voted for the BJP in 2019 said that they did so primarily because of him. ⁠
⁠
This also makes the party vulnerable: surveys suggest that without Mr Modi at the helm, its support could drop to within striking distance of the opposition. Some analysts argue that the lower turnout in the ongoing election already indicates an element of “Modi fatigue” among voters.⁠

As a result, the BJP needs to start raising the profile of potential heirs. ⁠

"“What made you wanted was nothing you did, it was something you had, and how could you ever tell whether you had it?”⁠
⁠
Alice Munro, a Nobel-prize winning short-story author, has died, aged 92.⁠
⁠
As a girl, Ms Munro was told that the worst thing she could do was to “call attention to yourself” or “think you were smart”. For her, books were vessels to be drained immediately. In her stories, libraries were a ticket to another life.⁠
⁠
In adulthood, plunged in the domesticity of suburban Vancouver, she dreamed up plots. She inhabited a “secret world”, while “doing something else in the normal world”. ⁠

Her short stories have the emotional depth of novels. She wrote about the clamour of desire, the self-deception and destruction, without ever being sentimental. Tap the link in our bio to read our obituary of Ms Munro.⁠

"Just over six years ago, when Donald Trump first announced tariffs on Chinese goods, it was as if a bomb had gone off. American stocks fell sharply at the prospect of a trade war, businesses warned of blowback and economists lined up to decry the move. ⁠
⁠
Such is the protectionist mood in Washington today that Joe Biden’s announcement of new measures has been met with rather less panic—even though it concerns significantly higher tariffs.⁠
⁠
On Wednesday, following a policy review, the White House decided to raise tariffs on, among other things, Chinese semiconductors and solar cells from 25% to 50%, syringes and needles from 0% to 50% and lithium-ion batteries from 7.5% to 25%. It hit electric vehicles with the biggest increase of all, quadrupling the tariff rate on China-made electric vehicles from 25% to 100%.⁠
⁠
Lael Brainard of the National Economic Council said the actions would create “a level playing-field in industries that are vital to our future”. But to learn why it is American consumers who will pay the price, tap the link in our bio. ⁠

"America has a deserved reputation as a country at the cutting-edge of innovation, fuelled by entrepreneurial vim. But in recent years some economists have worried that this reputation no longer holds true. ⁠

Startups have formed a smaller and smaller portion of the business landscape: in 1982 some 38% of American firms were less than five years old; by 2018, 29% were that young. ⁠

The share of Americans working for startups likewise fell. Silicon Valley sizzled with high-tech wizardry, but its giant companies hoarded the best researchers, leading to a slower spread of new ideas throughout the country.

⁠
But after four months in the job, the 35-year-old remains France’s second most-popular politician, after Edouard Philippe, an ex-prime minister, and way ahead of his boss, Emmanuel Macron, in 20th place. Yet even Mr Attal’s star is beginning to wane. His approval ratings have slipped by nine points in some polls since he took office. ⁠

Despite all this, Mr Attal seems to be in his element. He relishes tough public debate, and has a knack for plain speaking and a common touch that tend to elude his Jupiterian boss. ⁠

These are small circular velodromes where the track, instead of being lightly raked, is completely vertical. Viewed from above, the effect is of riders zooming around the inside of a washing machine.⁠

What drives these brave souls up the wall is the speed at which they travel. At around 50 kilometres per hour, the forces acting on them are strong enough to counterbalance gravity’s pull, and keep them pushed outwards.⁠

The party’s leadership has spearheaded a “smoked-salmon offensive”, inviting executives to breakfast and waxing lyrical about the virtues of profit.⁠

Bosses are keen to listen. It is easier to get tickets to see ­Taylor Swift’s opening night in London than to attend Labour’s “business day” at a dingy conference centre. ⁠
⁠
Executives can see which way the electoral wind is blowing, obviously, but there is more to it than that. Polls of business leaders suggest they would rather see Labour in power than the ruling Conservatives. ⁠

Yet probe those leaders in private, and they profess alarming uncertainty about what lies in store under Sir Keir Starmer as a Labour prime minister. Are these fears unfounded? Tap the link in our bio to find out whether businesses have reason to worry.⁠

Bosses are keen to listen It is easier to get tickets to see Taylor Swifts opening night in London than to attend Labours business day at a dingy conference centre 

Executives can see which way the electoral wind is blowing obviously but there is more to it than that Polls of business leaders suggest they would rather see Labour in power than the ruling Conservatives 

Yet probe those leaders in private and they profess alarming uncertainty about what lies in store under Sir Keir Starmer as a Labour prime minister Are these fears unfounded Tap the link in our bio to find out whether businesses have reason to worry

"A scourge has brought misery to Latin America. ⁠
⁠
Despite being home to just 8% of the world’s population, the region accounts for a third of its murders.⁠
⁠
To deal with the violence, Latin American leaders often resort to mano dura, the iron fist. They impose states of emergency, which may last indefinitely; they send the army into the streets; they carry out indiscriminate mass arrests. ⁠
⁠
Mano dura has been championed by El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, who has locked up almost 80,000 people—over 1% of the population—in the past two years. ⁠

How could a lone judge in small-­town Texas deprive millions of American women of a drug that has been deemed by doctors to be safer than Tylenol?⁠

But these figures are tricky to compare: the amount spent on wages and fuel, for example, will stretch a lot further in some countries than in others. ⁠

To get around this, The Economist adjusted estimates from a tally released by SIPRI, a think-tank based in Stockholm, for military purchasing-power parity (PPP), with help from Peter Robertson, a researcher at the University of Western Australia. ⁠

This makes defence budgets comparable with America’s: pay is adjusted for wage differences and operating costs for general price levels. (Equipment costs are left the same, as much of the kit is imported, and its relative quality is hard to judge.)⁠

But it is tricky to predict how many MPs each party will have partly because national voting intentions do not convert simply into seats in Parliament

In order to provide a seatbyseat prediction of Britains looming election we have built a new data model using 9398 individual constituencylevel election results along with available polling data from every election since 1959

"When Aravind Srinivas co-founded Perplexity, a generative-AI startup recently valued at $1bn, he did so with ambition. His “answer engine” is aimed at competing with Google search, one of the best business models of all time. ⁠
⁠
Mr Srinivas is a student of disruption.⁠
⁠
Rather than explaining how Perplexity’s business model will enable it to attack the search giant, he uses a concept outlined in “The Innovator’s Dilemma”, a management bestseller from 1997 by Clayton Christensen, to identify what he sees as the Achilles heel of Alphabet, Google's parent company. ⁠

"“The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have all engaged in some form of quantitative tightening (QT),” writes Tomasz Wieladek in a guest essay.⁠
⁠
“This involves central banks either not reinvesting maturing government debt or, in the Bank of England’s case, selling bonds to shrink their balance-sheets.”⁠
⁠
The European economist adds that, broadly, two years of QT have worked. “Could central banks’ confidence that QT effects are only small be misplaced?” he asks. ⁠
⁠
“There are several reasons why the overall effects could be larger,” he argues.⁠

It is a rare close friend on a continent where wariness of China has become the norm. It also happens that the country’s capital, Belgrade, witnessed a seminal moment in the evolution of West-despising Chinese nationalism. Twenty-five years ago American bombs hit the Chinese embassy there (pictured), killing three people. ⁠

On his first visit to Europe since 2019 Mr Xi has been holding talks with Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, hoping to persuade him and his allies that China and its high-tech products are good for them.

At the start of this ﬁscal hullabaloo, in 1992, America’s net debt amounted to 46% of GDP. Today it has reached 96%. ⁠

"When it comes to disinformation, “social media took the cost of distribution to zero, and generative AI takes the cost of generation to zero,” says Renée DiResta of the Stanford Internet Observatory.⁠
⁠
Large language models such as GPT-4 make it easy to produce misleading news articles or social-media posts in huge quantities. And AI can produce more than text.⁠
⁠
Microsoft’s VALL-E model is able to clone a person’s voice from just a three-second clip of them speaking. Sora, a model from OpenAI (yet to be released to the public) can produce realistic synthetic videos, in response to text prompts. ⁠
⁠
As well as providing new ways to discredit or misrepresent politicians, AI tools also raise the spectre of personalised disinformation, generated to appeal to small groups (think soccer moms in a specific town).⁠

Divesting from something has obvious symbolic value. But many protesters hope to have a real-world impact, too. ⁠

Such campaigns aim to starve their targets of capital. Scare investors from an industry or country and, so the argument goes, companies will find it harder to raise money, which will force them to change their behaviour. ⁠

"In England’s local elections, the last results of which are being announced this weekend, Labour has won wherever it needed to and even in a few places it really did not.⁠

From Manchester to London, Sir Keir Starmer’s party took almost all the mayoralties up for grabs and scooped up councillors and councils across a range of target seats. ⁠
⁠
In contrast the ruling Conservatives were pummelled; their losses are at the top end of the worst expectations.⁠
⁠
And to cap it all off, Labour also won in a parliamentary by-election in Blackpool South, achieving the third-biggest swing since the second world war. ⁠

"Recently film-­makers, critics and viewers have been debating the lack of sex on screen. Some feel that Hollywood has entered a puritanical age and place blame at the feet of the #MeToo movement and celibate superhero films.⁠
⁠
Others disagree; they point to examples of highly explicit scenes in recent films, including “Fair Play” and “Poor Things”, which involve sex in public toilets and brothels.⁠

Who is right? Stephen Follows, a film-data analyst, has examined the 250 highest-­grossing movies in America every year since 2000. He has found that the level of sexual content has fallen by almost 40%.⁠

"Visit any body of water in Britain this summer and you will spot them, wielding their paddles like modern-day Argonauts.⁠

In the past three years stand-up paddleboarding (or SUPing) has gone from obscurity to popularity in Britain. Some 4.5m people have dabbled; over 1m own a board, according to one survey.⁠
⁠
However, when paddleboards were first invented in Hawaii in the 1940s, they struggled to take off. Originally marketed to surfers as a backup for days of flat water, early adopters used them for racing and exploring coastlines.⁠

Both families have grubby histories. Mr Marcos is the son of a despot who stole billions, tortured thousands and was ousted by a popular uprising in 1986. Ms Duterte is the daughter of Rodrigo Duterte, who as president from 2016-­22 urged the whole-sale murder of drug suspects and called the pope a “son of a whore”.⁠

"Flashbangs to clear occupied buildings, helmet-wearing police officers and handcuffed students: the scenes at Columbia and other American universities seem like a throwback to a rougher age. ⁠

More than 1,500 students have been arrested around the country so far, and the number will probably rise in the coming weeks. For college presidents this is nightmarish.⁠
⁠
As a practical question, dealing with student protests is hard. As an intellectual question, the sort debated on college campuses, it really is not. Wherever possible, they should be resolved through negotiation. ⁠

"Britons are dying alone—and sometimes it takes weeks for anyone to notice.⁠
⁠
The authors of a recent study looked at records of deaths for which pathologists were unable to determine a cause during an autopsy (coded as “unascertained”). ⁠
⁠
In the vast majority of cases, this is usually because a body is too decomposed to examine properly. Their research suggests that the number of unascertained deaths in England and Wales increased five-fold between 1992 and 2022, even as overall mortality rates were falling.⁠
⁠
Yet these figures only account for the most extreme cases of decomposition, notes Theodore Estrin-Serlui, a pathologist in London. “We’re talking about people who die alone and aren’t found for a good period of time.”⁠
⁠
Family breakdowns, rising separation rates and changing social norms have pushed more people to live by themselves.⁠

The region’s famous bears had been on the verge of dying out until an EU-funded project boosted the population with Slovenian bears in the late 1990s. The bears quickly multiplied, much faster than expected, and began foraging in human territory. Some officials wanted the dangerous ones culled, others supported the bears’ rights to life.⁠

"On some parts of the front line, for every shell the Ukrainians have shot at Russian lines, the Russians have rained down 17 in response. Ukrainian forces have been rationing ammunition, for fear of running out. ⁠
⁠
That scarcity was a reflection of America’s failure to approve any new military aid for Ukraine since last summer.⁠
⁠
This week, however, after months of dithering, Congress approved $40bn of such assistance, a sum roughly equivalent to all America’s military aid to Ukraine since the war began. ⁠

But the imbalance in firepower of recent months has already had grim consequences. And even the fresh infusion of weaponry will not wholly eliminate Russia’s advantage. Ukraine is therefore likely to remain on the back foot, unable to mount new offensives.⁠

"Talk of India’s economic prospects often focus on Bangalore, the tech hub, or Mumbai, the financial centre. But Narendra Modi’s ambition of developed-country status by 2047 needs a broader perspective.⁠

GDP grew at a blistering 8.4% in the year to the fourth quarter of 2023 (though the underlying trend is closer to 6.5% because of quirks in how India measures GDP).⁠

But overall growth during Mr Modi’s tenure has not been remarkable by the country’s standards since it embarked on a path of liberalisation in the early 1990s.⁠

"In 2022, five Supreme Court justices wrote they were returning the issue of abortion to “legislative bodies”. Two years on, that sounds like wishful thinking: the court finds itself right back in the middle of America’s abortion battle. ⁠
⁠
This week, the question was whether state bans that criminalise terminations are trumped by a federal law concerning emergency care.⁠
⁠
The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labour Act (EMTALA), passed in 1986, requires hospitals receiving federal funding to offer “stabilising treatment” to people showing up in their emergency rooms. In 2022 the Biden administration notified hospitals that this duty includes offering abortion when a woman’s pregnancy poses immediate risks to her health. ⁠
⁠
But a law passed that year—the Idaho Defence of Life Act—prohibits abortion except in cases of rape or incest, or when “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman”. ⁠

It worked—the party and its allies swept back to power by winning 353 of 543 seats in the lower house of the national parliament, earning Narendra Modi a second term as prime minister. ⁠

Ahead of this year’s election the BJP has adopted an almost identical slogan. But what that lacks in creativity, it makes up for in ambition: the bar is now at 400. ⁠

"American university presidents are struggling with policing free speech on campus: specifically, how to deal with pro-Palestinian protests. ⁠
⁠
After seeing timid responses by the heads of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania lead to their forced resignations a few months ago, leaders are now trying a tougher approach. But they are in danger of over-correcting.⁠
⁠
The trigger for the latest troubles was the clearing by police of tents and protesters at Columbia last week, and the arrest of more than 100 students.⁠
⁠
“The irony is that in trying to quiet things down and assert control over the encampment, the administration unleashed this firestorm,” says David Pozen, a law professor at the university. That firestorm has now spread, with tent encampments popping up far beyond Columbia. ⁠

Canada produces 78% of the world’s maple syrup, 92% of it from Quebec. The golden goo is tightly controlled by a handful of large wholesalers, who ensure prices won’t fall even in years of record-setting production.⁠
⁠
Strong recent output is helping to replenish Canada’s stockpile of the stuff, which is at its lowest level for 16 years.⁠

But while the warmth of the 2024 season is proving to be a boon to syrup-sourcing, that masks erratic output. Tap the link in our bio to discover why climate change may be putting the industry in a sticky situation.⁠

"Since shares in Donald Trump’s media firm began trading publicly less than a month ago, their value has slid by more than half, prompting headlines, and some crowing from the left, about the decline. ⁠
⁠
More newsworthy, perhaps, is that anyone is buying at all. Even at roughly $26 per share, investors are prizing Mr Trump’s social­-media platform, Truth Social, at a heroic value relative to its performance or apparent potential.⁠
⁠
After forecasting sales of $144m for 2023, Truth Social delivered just $4.1m, and a loss of $58.2m. But compared with those in other startups, investors are clearly not relying upon the same sort of analysis in their speculation.⁠

Now their group, Smartphone-Free Childhood, has more than 60,000 followers debating how to keep their children away from the demon devices. This group, based in Britain, is not the only one worried about screentime.⁠

The concerns are summed up by a recent book by Jonathan Haidt, “The Anxious Generation”. It argues that smartphones, and the social networks accessed through them, are causing a malign “rewiring of childhood”.⁠

Retribution now seems inevitable. But Israel’s government should bide its time. ⁠

If Israel acts rashly, its neighbours will bear a heavy cost in a wider regional war; America and Europe will be sucked into hostilities; oil prices will soar; and global trade will be disrupted. Only Iran’s “axis of resistance” would welcome chaos.⁠

Retribution now seems inevitable But Israels government should bide its time 

If Israel acts rashly its neighbours will bear a heavy cost in a wider regional war America and Europe will be sucked into hostilities oil prices will soar and global trade will be disrupted Only Irans axis of resistance would welcome chaos

"Rahul Gandhi’s father, grandmother and great-grandfather were all Indian prime ministers. But after fronting the Congress party’s ill-fated campaigns for general election in 2014 and 2019, even close friends wondered if he had the drive to follow in their footsteps.⁠
⁠
In the run-up to this year’s contest, Mr Gandhi has found the fire in his belly. That was one takeaway when we joined him on the campaign trail. In rallies across the western state of Maharashtra, he denounced Narendra Modi, the prime minister, as a threat to democracy. He castigated the tycoons who dominate its economy. And he deplored India's rampant inequality.⁠
⁠
The question now is whether the Cambridge-educated, half-Italian scion of a political dynasty is the right person to overhaul a party that even some allies liken to a dysfunctional family business.⁠
⁠
Congress is still the only viable national alternative to Narendra Modi’s ruling BJP. But a return to power depends on whether Mr Gandhi can confront three urgent challenges. Tap the link in our bio to discover what they are.⁠

"“The war between Russia and Ukraine has been catastrophic for both countries,” writes Feng Yujun, a Chinese expert on Russia. ⁠
⁠
Though the fighting is unlikely to end soon, “the conflict is a post-cold-war watershed that will have a profound, lasting global impact,” the professor argues in a guest essay for The Economist.⁠
⁠
Chinese relations with Russia have been “affected” by events of the past two years, he explains. “Shrewd observers note that China’s stance towards Russia has reverted from the ‘no limits’ stance of early 2022”.⁠

Four factors make the country’s eventual defeat in Ukraine “inevitable”, suggests Professor Yujun. Tap the link in our bio to discover why he believes its nuclear capability is “no guarantee of success”.⁠

The third character turns this chronicle of violence into a surprisingly tender and redemptive story.⁠
⁠
Sir Salman was about to speak at a festival in upstate New York when a man rushed the stage, inflicting 15 wounds in a 27-second frenzy. It was 33 years since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran had called for Sir Salman’s death because of the alleged blasphemy of “The Satanic Verses”.⁠

"Donald Trump first inched ahead of Joe Biden in national surveys last September, and has held a narrow lead for most of 2024. But even more surprising than the scale of his apparent electoral renaissance is its source.⁠
⁠
White voters’ preferences have changed little since 2020, while racial-minority groups—long the bedrock of Democratic support—have lurched away from Mr Biden.⁠
⁠
Standard surveys don’t obtain enough data to drill down within these groups. A YouGov sample of 49,000 people enables greater interrogation. ⁠
⁠
Perhaps the most intriguing pattern is a powerful factor that has nothing to do with ideology. Tap the link in our bio to discover why swing voters are vastly more likely to have children aged under 18.⁠

"Talk to utilities and data-centre operators and, though many are excited about AI, they are grappling with an energy conundrum on which the future of three big economic shifts partly hinges: the AI revolution; the efforts to electrify swathes of the economy; and the fight against climate change. ⁠
⁠
In a nutshell, “generative” AI, the sort behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has a ravenous appetite for electricity. It has landed on a global energy system that is already struggling to cope with alternative sources of power demand. It is not yet clear whether there will be enough clean energy to meet everyone’s needs.⁠
⁠
At first glance, the solution looks simple. Data centres, such as those that companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft use to supply cloud-computing services, have over the past decade or so accounted for only 1-2% of global energy demand. For years the big-tech “hyperscalers” have harvested ever greater energy efficiencies from their server farms, even as the world’s computing workloads have soared. Moreover, they have invested heavily in clean energy to offset their carbon footprints. ⁠
⁠
But generative AI changes the nature of the game. Tap the link in our bio to find out why.⁠

"Little was simple about Rose Dugdale: debutante­-terrorist; heiress­-thief; oxymoron incarnate. Her father would blame her Oxford education. She blamed Britain, the “filthy enemy” she had turned against.⁠
⁠
In the years after she helped hijack a helicopter to drop bombs in Northern Ireland, people would wonder why an educated woman had turned to terrorism. Yet she was a rebel not despite her advantages but because of them.⁠
⁠
History would absolve her for her militancy, she believed. The legal system was less lenient: after she was caught, she was sentenced to nine years in prison.⁠

"Ukraine, outgunned by Russia, is employing AI in diverse ways to gain an edge.⁠

A Ukrainian colonel involved in arms development says drone designers commonly query ChatGPT as a “start point” for engineering ideas, like novel techniques for reducing vulnerability to Russian jamming. It is also being used to help identify targets and catch sanctions-busters.⁠

The use of AI has been developing for some time. It now provides senior officials with guidance on sensitive matters, including mobilisation policy, says Mykola Dobysh, the National Security and Defence Council’s chief technologist. ⁠

"Orenthal James (O.J.) Simpson, who died this week, overcame childhood rickets to be rated the “Most Valuable Player” in America’s National Football League. He starred in movies and made a fortune endorsing rental cars.⁠
⁠
Then, in 1994, his former wife, Nicole Brown, and a friend of hers, Ron Goldman, were found stabbed to death. ⁠
⁠
Simpson, whom Brown had previously accused of violence and threats, was immediately suspected. He fled—and a cavalcade of police cars slowly pursued his white Bronco truck along the freeways of Los Angeles. News helicopters beamed live coverage. His trial brought America to a standstill. Perhaps 150m people watched it on TV. ⁠
⁠
When he was acquitted, white America gasped with disbelief. Black Americans celebrated. ⁠
⁠
The jury that acquitted Simpson was three-quarters black. The jury that reached the opposite conclusion in a civil trial in 1997, finding him liable for the two murders and ordering him to pay millions of dollars to the victims’ families, was mostly white. Presented with the same set of facts, white and black Americans saw a different reality.⁠
⁠
The techniques of persuasion deployed by Simpson’s lawyers were a harbinger of those deployed by populists such as Donald Trump today. ⁠

"A new report, commissioned by England’s National Health Service, assesses the evidence for and against treatments for children who identify as transgender. Its conclusions will reverberate on both sides of the Atlantic, where approaches to transgender care differ wildly.⁠
⁠
The laissez-faire approach, common in blue states in America, argues that if children identify as the opposite gender and desperately want to adjust their bodies to align with that feeling, they should be allowed to do so. The draconian approach, common in red American states, is that such treatments should simply be banned.⁠
⁠
The cautious approach, which informs policy in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and now England, stresses that more evidence is needed. ⁠
⁠
Transgender people should always be treated with respect and kindness, and adults should be free to make their own decisions about their bodies. But as Hilary Cass, the British doctor who wrote the report, concludes, it is essential to guard against “the creep of unproven approaches into clinical practice”.⁠

The fact that one of those bright ideas ended up boiled down into an object bearing his name, which became the subject of a world-­encompassing multi­-billion-­dollar “quest”, was a source of some exaspera­tion. The Higgs boson’s discovery, he said, “ruined my life”.⁠

The simplest working definition is that it refers to the majority of non-Western countries.

Under one scenario presented in the book, AI progresses to the point at which it can do all economically valuable work at almost no cost. Under a yet more radical scenario, even tasks that you might think would be reserved for humans, such as parenting, can be done better by AI.⁠

"Until recently Captain James Cook was not a particularly controversial figure. ⁠

But in January a statue of the 18th-century British sailor and explorer was toppled in Melbourne and the words “The colony will fall” spraypainted on the plinth. In Hawaii an obelisk in Cook’s memory has been splattered with red paint and the message “You are on native land.” ⁠

"“Climate change and spiralling conflict are two of the defining features of our time,” writes Andrew Gilmour. “Each by itself is extremely serious. When they come together, as they increasingly do, the result may be globally devastating.”⁠
⁠
“Climate change increases the risk of conflict,” says the head of the Berghof Foundation in a guest essay. But he argues that “the world has an opportunity to use this crisis to forge a better future”. ⁠
⁠
He makes the case for environmental peacebuilding, which can be “a way to advance climate action and promote peace simultaneously”. ⁠
⁠
But Mr Gilmour says that more support is needed from governments and international organisations, otherwise as the problem of climate change and conflict becomes more acute, its effects will spread beyond the regions most susceptible to both. Tap the link in our bio to read his full essay.⁠

"Russia’s invasion has turned Ukraine into the world’s most heavily mined country. ⁠
⁠
In Kherson and Kharkhiv Russian soldiers left minefields when they retreated. As well as laying mines to defend their positions, they used them to disrupt Ukrainian farming, a pillar of the country’s economy. There has been a human cost, too. ⁠
⁠
The government subsidises demining. But licensed outfits are overwhelmed, and the process is still too costly for many farmers. With spring sowing under way, some farmers are turning to the black market—or doing it themselves. ⁠

Then, thanks to the Romantic poets, the word took on emotional overtones. Loneliness became a condition of the soul. By the early 20th century it had come to be considered one of the defining afflictions of urban life.⁠

"America’s nuclear arsenal should be “large and diverse” enough to deter hostile leaders from attacking it or its allies, writes Frank Miller.⁠

An effective deterrent requires the capability to target what potential enemy leaders value most, the nuclear defence policy expert argues in a guest essay.⁠

“Because of the significant growth in Russian and Chinese nuclear capabilities over the past decade, the deterrent believed necessary when New START took effect in 2011 is no longer sufficient.”⁠

In one sense, 2023 was merely another step along a grim, familiar path—South America has lost 30% of its primary forest cover since 2001.⁠

But there are reasons for optimism, too. Though the loss of 2,000 square kilometres is tragic, it represents a 24% reduction in deforestation on the previous year. ⁠

Brazil and Colombia did the most to curb deforestation, coinciding with their respective pro-environment presidents, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Gustavo Petro, taking office. ⁠

"At the age of 70 some might think about retiring, if they have not done so already. Not Godzilla. ⁠
⁠
Since the giant lizard made his screen debut in “Gojira”, a Japanese film released in 1954, he has crashed his way through nearly 40 movies. Guinness World Records certifies Godzilla as the longest-running movie franchise. ⁠
⁠
And the monster does not show any sign of slowing down. In December “Godzilla Minus One”, a Japanese film, became a box-office hit. “Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” has recently hit cinemas, too.⁠
⁠
From his conception, Godzilla has symbolised the fears of his time. He was created from the wreckage of the second world war. Ishiro Honda, the writer-director of “Gojira”, was haunted by the bombing of Hiroshima, the aftermath of which he witnessed first-hand.⁠

At the start of the war, when Ukraine lost access to its deep-water ports in the Black Sea, the EU temporarily exempted Ukrainian lorry drivers from a permit system that restricts movement in and out of the bloc. That was a challenge to Polish drivers, who had dominated the local freight business. ⁠
⁠
Meanwhile a suspension of import duties and quotas on Ukrainian agricultural goods posed unexpected competition to small Polish farmsteads, already pinched by EU environmental legislation. ⁠

"A new hard right is gaining power in Latin America.⁠
⁠
Its ascent began with the surprise victory of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil in 2018, followed by that of Nayib Bukele, El Salvador’s popular autocratic president, in 2019. ⁠
⁠
In Chile, José Antonio Kast, the founder of a new hard-right Republican Party, took almost half of the vote in a presidential run-off in 2021. Javier Milei won his own surprise victory in Argentina in November, and would-be leaders of the radical right jostle in the politics of Peru and Colombia.⁠
⁠
Unlike its older European and North American equivalents, the Latin American hard right does not have roots in public anxiety about uncontrolled immigration.⁠
⁠
Instead the new group shares three hallmarks: a fierce opposition to crime, abortion and socialism.⁠
⁠
But despite these common factors, the alliance seems like no more than a loose friendship network. Tap the link in our bio to learn why. ⁠

Its famously industrious workforce is shrinking, history’s wildest property boom has turned to bust and the global system of free trade that China used to get richer is disintegrating. ⁠

Xi Jinping’s response is to double down on an audacious plan to remake the economy by dominating the industries of tomorrow, with the ultimate aim of inverting the balance of power in the global economy.⁠

"In 1960 America had around 18,000 nuclear weapons. It also had detailed plans for how to use them.⁠
⁠
Had it implemented them, 275m people in the Soviet Union would have been killed in the first hour of war. Another 325m would have died from radioactive fallout over the following six months. Even if China stayed out of this prospective war, the fallout would have killed as many as 300m of its citizens.⁠

"With close to half the world’s population expected to be obese or overweight by 2030, according to the World Obesity Federation, demand for a new generation of weight-loss drugs is surging.⁠
⁠
These drugs mimic GLP-1, a gut hormone secreted by the intestines after a meal. Since the late 1980s scientists believed that the hormone could help treat diabetes. But they had also been aware of another side-effect: it suppresses appetite.⁠
⁠
The potential weight-loss benefits were not seriously pursued until Novo Nordisk’s breakthrough clinical trial in 2021, where overweight or obese patients were treated with its GLP-1-based diabetic drug, semaglutide, which was then being marketed under the name Ozempic. Medicines that mimic GLP-1 have since become blockbusters. ⁠

"Israel is playing a dangerous game in Syria. ⁠

On Monday a suspected Israeli air strike flattened a building at the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus. The blast killed seven people, including several high-ranking Iranian officers. It was a serious escalation in the long shadow war between Israel and Iran, hitting a target that should have been off-limits under international norms.⁠

Iranian officers were not in Damascus to negotiate lower pistachio tariffs.

"Turkey’s opposition has scored a spectacular upset in local elections, surging past the ruling Justice and Development (AK) party nationwide, and handing Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, a stinging rebuke. ⁠
⁠
With nearly all ballots counted, the Republican People’s Party (CHP) had received 37.7% of the overall vote, compared with 35.5% for AK. That overall figure masked landslide wins in the big cities. ⁠
⁠
In Istanbul, the most important prize in the elections, in which Turks voted for mayors and city councils, Ekrem Imamoglu, the city’s CHP mayor, coasted to another term. ⁠

The scale of Mr Erdogan’s losses in the city and elsewhere means that his appetite for constitutional changes may now be diminished. Tap the link in our bio to discover how the opposition managed to redraw the political map.⁠

"Europe’s economy is still reeling from the energy shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. How will it adapt to a new shock from China and maybe a third from America?⁠

This combination of challenges could lead to an extended period of restructuring in the European economy. ⁠

For the continent’s consumers, this would be a mixed blessing. Trade wars make goods pricier and reduce choice—but when China subsidises solar panels, European utilities and households get cheaper energy.⁠

Today the fiercest demand for cocaine comes from Europe, where its wholesale price is some 40% higher than in the United States. To meet this demand, smugglers have woven a different set of Caribbean islands into their supply chains: Europe’s overseas territories.⁠

Politicians of all stripes point to the Siemens factory producing them as a model. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour Party’s leader, has bold ambitions of Britain becoming a “green-growth superpower”, spurred by a boom in manufacturing jobs.⁠

That is improbable. Britain is an open, services-based economy. Unlike Germany, South Korea or parts of America, it has little industrial heft.⁠

But most of what makes killer whale ecotypes distinct is their culture—socially learned behaviours that killer whales are known to transmit from one generation to the next. ⁠

"Haiti is waiting. Gangs control large parts of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The government of Kenya, which has proposed leading a UN-approved mission to secure Haiti, has said it will not send any forces until a transitional government is in place to take over from Ariel Henry, the exiled prime minister. ⁠
⁠
More than two weeks after Mr Henry said he would step down, a newly formed transitional council has not been able to agree on who would lead it in order to form that government. Two of its members have already dropped out. ⁠
⁠
Although an outside force could be decisive in the struggle against the gangs, the politics of its arrangement are made fraught by Haiti’s unhappy history of external intervention. In the meantime it is left to Haiti’s ragtag police force to prevent gangs taking complete control of the country. Tap the link in our bio to read why that is not going well.⁠

"Vladimir Putin is a man who likes victories, and preferably stage-managed ones. The dictator copes less well with unscheduled setbacks, preferring to disappear from the stage. ⁠
⁠
His 19-hour delay to speak about the massive intelligence failure at Crocus City Hall in Moscow, which killed at least 137 people, followed this familiar pattern.⁠
⁠
Mr Putin claimed, ludicrously, that Ukraine had opened a border “window” to the terrorists as they tried to escape Russia in their white Renault Symbol. He stopped short of directly attributing responsibility to Ukraine for the attack—and said nothing about the Islamic State group that said it had carried it out. ⁠
⁠
Part of Mr Putin’s reluctance to go all-in on blaming Ukraine might reflect a worry that the American government is sitting on intelligence that could undermine such a claim. Part might be embarrassment at his security agencies’ failure to act on American warnings earlier this month of an imminent attack.⁠

Elena Vernham (played by Kate Winslet) and her country are sly composites of real people and places. The main influence is Vladimir Putin’s Russia: Elena's courtiers applaud her atrocious singing, just as Mr Putin’s lickspittles let him win at ice hockey. ⁠

Artistically, the show has flaws. It tries vainly to make you care about its characters even as it sends them up. ⁠

More popular with Democrats than Republicans, the $1.2trn package marginally reduces government spending but on its own won’t significantly alter America’s fiscal destiny.⁠

"Immigration has transformed Britain. ⁠

The 2021 census of England and Wales showed that 10m people, one-sixth of the population, were born outside the United Kingdom. That was a higher share than in America or any large European country except Germany. The proportion is almost certainly higher today.⁠
⁠
But immigration is a prickly political issue, particularly on the right. Polls show that Conservative voters cite it and asylum as an important issue more often than anything else.⁠

"Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League party is back in power. ⁠

Following elections last month, the thrice former prime minister’s younger brother, Shehbaz, has been installed in the ruling post. His daughter, Maryam, is the new chief minister of populous Punjab. ⁠

So why is the “lion of Punjab” so glum?⁠

Mr Sharif spent four years in exile in London because Pakistan’s generals—stage managers of its democracy—were against him. They rigged an election in 2018 in favour of his main rival, Imran Khan. But then they fell out with Mr Khan and reverted to the lion.⁠

"To most NIMBYs, who oppose local construction, the residents they prevent from living in new housing projects are an afterthought. ⁠

Conserving what already exists, rather than adding to building stocks, avoids increasing “embodied emissions”—they argue.⁠

Yet wherever their would-be neighbours live, they will have a carbon footprint, which would be lower if they could move to a city.⁠

Targets set by the Kremlin for regional authorities, which were leaked to Russian independent media, specified that the turnout should between 70% and 80% and that 75-85% of the votes should go to Vladimir Putin.⁠

Early results suggest his tally may be even higher.⁠
⁠
Threats and coercion were the main instruments of his campaign. And still, protests during the voting showed that the country harbours a great deal of pent-up resentment against Mr Putin and his usurpation of power.⁠

Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader who died in prison in the Arctic a month before the “elections”, had encouraged voters to go to the polls at noon, and to vote against Mr Putin, spoil their ballot paper or simply show their opposition by lengthening the queue. ⁠

"Last year Mexico overtook China to become the number-one exporter to the United States.⁠
⁠
The last time this happened, in 2002, it was a passing blip. Today its rise has the whiff of a new order for global trade.⁠

American efforts to decouple from China and bring supply chains closer to home are intensifying, pushing more trade through Mexico.⁠

But the third side of this triangle is creating tension. Chinese firms have been pouring money into the Mexican market—and some US officials and industrialists believe Chinese inflows are being undercounted, whether deliberately or not. ⁠

America’s House of Representatives passed a bill barring app stores and internet providers from distributing “foreign-adversary-controlled applications”. The target is clear: TikTok.⁠

The short-video app’s position in America has long been precarious. Although the firm is based in Los Angeles and Singapore, it is a subsidiary of ByteDance, a Chinese tech giant. The fear is that the Chinese government could use it to spy on American citizens or shape public opinion.⁠

If the bill becomes law, ByteDance would have to sell the app’s American operations within six months or shut them down. But before President Joe Biden can give it his signature, the bill must first pass the Senate.⁠

The centre-right Democratic Alliance, led by the conservative Social Democratic Party, came a narrow first. The Socialists lost seats and their leader said they would not try to reconstitute a rickety multi-party coalition of the kind the party led after 2015.⁠

"When a fetus shows signs of trouble in the womb, doctors face a precarious task. They must find out what is wrong and how to help without jeopardising the pregnancy. ⁠

Despite sophisticated modern genetic and imaging tests, many questions are difficult to answer—how severe a malformation is, for example, or how a fetus might respond to treatment. ⁠
⁠
But now scientists have developed a way to create simplified versions of a fetus’s own organs, outside the womb, giving doctors the ability to prod and probe without putting anyone at risk.⁠

On Thursday he took a step towards dispelling such doubts with a forceful state-of-the-union address in which he extolled his achievements, demanded action from congressional Republicans to secure the border and make taxation fairer, and repeatedly attacked Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, whom he referred to never by name but as “my predecessor”.⁠

"For millennia, exile has been a way for critics to escape the iron fist of tyrants and for regimes to silence dissidents. ⁠
⁠
Now authoritarian regimes are watching and coercing their critics abroad, too.⁠
⁠
Over the past 30 years open borders have created large diasporas in foreign lands. Technology has amplified individuals’ voices and their connection to their homeland, but also enabled monitoring, intimidation and censorship by distant governments. ⁠

Many autocracies now aspire to control ideas and people abroad as well as at home.⁠

The Epic Passa season ticket launched by Vail Mountain Resortshas changed the offer Skiers can now get skiing at a whole group of resorts cheaply but only by committing before the season starts The result according to an industry writer is that for the first time in decades skiing in America is reliably profitable 

But this has come at a cost to competitionand to some locals

"Protesting farmers are an alarming sight for India’s government.⁠
⁠
With nearly two-thirds of Indians dependent on farming for their livelihood, agricultural workers can make or break elections. They can also stymie policy making.⁠
⁠
Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party discovered this three years ago, when farmers marched on Delhi, forcing the government to repeal a big set of reforms intended to deregulate India’s agricultural market. It was one of the few political defeats the prime minister has suffered in a decade in power.⁠

Given this, the decision by several groups of farmers earlier this month to resume protests ahead of an election due by May clearly alarmed officials. ⁠

It started as a substitute for opioids supplied under prescription, but its continuing spread is the logical outcome of the war on drugs. Peddling narcotics is so lucrative that traffickers have an incentive to innovate, the better to evade controls.⁠

Over 60 of the French now see the RN as a political party like any other Nearly twothirds of voters think it can win office up from 40 in 2018 A plurality of the French no longer fear that it is a danger for democracy

The next French presidential election is not until 2027 Yet Ms Le Pen is already preparing to govern In 2022 she won the backing of nearly 42 of voters next time she will do better

France is not a country like any other It is nucleararmed highly centralised and concentrates unusual powers in the hands of a single person

That is why even three years out France and its friends should take a long hard look at Ms Le Pen and her project for power

On Monday Mohammad Shtayyeh, the current prime minister, resigned. In a speech he said that new “political arrangements” were required to consider “the emerging reality” in Gaza, where Israel has killed nearly 30,000 Palestinians during almost five months of war.⁠

The clear favourite to succeed him as prime minister is Mohammad Mustafa, an economist who heads Palestine’s sovereign-wealth fund.

"Usually with acute infections, if you survive them your immune system will clear things up and you can carry on as before. For an unlucky few, however, that is not the end of the story. ⁠

Certain infections have a second act, brought about by some consequence of the pathogen’s visit. Sometimes, the physiological chain is clear. Often, though, the connections are more opaque—particularly with neurological symptoms.⁠
⁠
One example of a post-infectious neurological syndrome (PINS) is long covid, which has shone a spotlight on the field.

"The year of the dragon, one of the 12 creatures in the Chinese zodiac, began this month. ⁠
⁠
But some Chinese state media have been calling it the year of the loong in their English reports. ⁠

Loong (pronounced like the English word “long”) sounds like the Mandarin term for dragon. It is more appropriate, says the state-run Beijing Daily, because Western dragons are evil monsters, whereas Chinese ones are noble and benevolent. The latter are said to bring good luck.⁠

"Boris Pistorius might seem an unlikely candidate for Germany’s most popular politician.⁠
⁠
A ruddy-faced veteran of local politics in the flat north-western state of Lower Saxony, he can sound gruff and dismissive.⁠
⁠
And for a country that has enjoyed eight decades of peace, that shuns nuclear weapons and still shudders with shame for instigating two world wars, Mr Pistorius’s message to bite the bullet and get “kriegstüchtig”, “war-capable”—and to get there fast—might seem jarring.⁠
⁠
Yet since being appointed defence minister 13 months ago the 63-year-old lawyer has topped every poll.⁠
⁠
This reflects the changing times, or more precisely the ”Zeitenwende”, a term that Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, used three days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to emphasise the gravity of the moment. From this point forward, Germany would have to build defences in a more hostile world.⁠

"Japanese men are having an identity crisis.⁠
⁠
Gender relations in Japan are shifting as marriage rates decline and more women enter the workforce. But the idea that men are breadwinners remains deeply entrenched.⁠
⁠
The country’s archetypal gender roles—the salaryman husband and stay-at-home mum—were cemented during the country’s long post-war boom.⁠
⁠
In many Western countries, those rigid roles began to break down following the oil crisis of the early 1970s, as more and more women entered work in response to economic stagnation and labour shortages. By contrast, Japan tried to overcome the crisis by extending men’s working hours. The country “missed the opportunity to change”, according to one sociologist.⁠
⁠
Now many Japanese men are weighed by pressure to fill the traditional male role.⁠

Now, with much of the world focused on crises elsewhere, a catastrophic third regional war risks being sparked in Congo—one that could possibly be averted but for the inattention of the West.⁠

The islets’ insulin producers are called beta cells. They are the only bodily sources of that hormone. So, if their number declines, trouble looms. And decline it does, in the condition known as type-1 diabetes. ⁠
⁠
Without an alternative supply of insulin, someone with type-1 diabetes will die. Supplementary insulin can be administered by injection or via a device called an insulin pump. ⁠
⁠
But a better method of treatment would be to replace the beta cells themselves—an approach that researchers are now exploring. ⁠
⁠
Could a cure for type-1 diabetes be on the horizon? Tap the link in our bio to learn how lab-grown, genetically modified beta cells could offer a step in the right direction ⁠

"Since February 2022 America, Europe and their allies have together deployed sanctions against more than 16,500 Russian targets. ⁠
⁠
The idea was to use the West’s clout over the global economy to prevent Vladimir Putin from obtaining the technology and the hard currency he needed to sustain his war effort. ⁠
⁠
But Russia’s economy has been more resilient, and the sanctions effort much leakier, than hoped. The war has shown just how quickly global trade and financial flows find a path around barriers that are put in their way.⁠
⁠
Now America and Europe are turning to secondary sanctions on Russia’s foreign abettors. ⁠

At a time when political support for funding Ukraine is fraying, sanctions seem like a cheap way to weaken Russia and defend Ukraine. But they are no substitute for sending Ukraine the money and arms it needs. Tap the link in our bio to learn why.⁠

"Since coming to power in 2014, Narendra Modi’s administration has shut or depleted thousands of charities, according to industry veterans. The sector is operating in an “environment of fear”, according to the boss of one NGO.⁠

The exact number of organisations affected is hard to ascertain because of the diverse legal means used against them, but victims in the past year include Care India and CPR, which may no longer receive foreign donations. ⁠

What explains the assault? To a degree, the curbs reflect a disagreement between the Bharatiya Janata Party and its rivals about the nature of development. But the weakness of the Indian state cannot be wished away.⁠

One is whether profound shifts in the character of war might render ground forces less important, if not irrelevant. A second is how to balance resources between Asia and Europe.⁠

"Xi Jinping will be watching America’s vote counts in November very closely. As China’s leader waits for a result, whom will he be cheering on? ⁠
⁠
Donald Trump’s presidency saw a profound shift in America’s policy towards China. His administration deployed tariffs in an attempt to reduce America’s trade deficit and protect jobs. It successfully redefined the domestic debate, with China portrayed as a political, technological and military adversary. ⁠
⁠
But Joe Biden’s more systematic approach to governing has posed a different kind of threat to China. America has kept the Trump tariffs in place, but has also built a comprehensive system for restricting Western technology flows to China.

"Industry consumes a third of all global energy. Research suggests that heat generation accounts for three quarters of that—a staggering 90% of which comes from burning fossil fuels.⁠
⁠
All this makes it a bigger source of greenhouse-gas emissions than power generation or transport. And industrial emissions are projected to keep growing indefinitely.⁠
⁠
Aware that this is impossible to square with their emission commitments, governments in advanced economies have showered subsidies on hydrogen and carbon capture. Both have so far disappointed.⁠

Electrification, meanwhile, had long been dismissed. It was argued that the very high temperatures required by heavy industry would be difficult to reach, and that carbon emissions would be unavoidable in the production of cement and steel.⁠

"In Europe, a controversy over lab-grown meat is searing.⁠
⁠
For its detractors, it is an abomination—“Franken-meat”. For its advocates it promises to help save the planet.⁠
⁠
Even if lab-grown meat merely replaced the stuff currently fed to pets, it would reduce the need to kill other animals. But it might pose an existential risk to livestock farmers, who are already protesting vigorously in Europe at rising costs, environmental restrictions and mounting paperwork.⁠
⁠
Last November Italy’s conservative government banned the stuff. Since then 11 other countries have lined up to defend “real” meat. ⁠

The accumulating evidence, open-source investigators say, suggests that a small team of Ukrainian special forces is fighting on the side of the national army, the Sudanese Armed Forces.⁠

If so, it suggests that the country is widening its fight against Russia well beyond its own borders. It also highlights how Sudan’s war is sucking in outsiders.⁠

How AI oversight affects human decision-making is an important question in a world where algorithms play an ever-larger role in everyday life. ⁠

Car drivers, financial traders and air-traffic controllers already routinely see their decisions overruled by AI systems put in place to correct poor judgment. ⁠

A man of formidable intelligence, Mr Navalny identified the two foundations on which Mr Putin has built his power: fear and greed. Not only did he understand those impulses, he struck at them in devastating ways. ⁠
⁠
In one of his early communications from jail he wrote that: “it is not honest people who frighten the authorities…but those who are not afraid, or, to be more precise: those who may be afraid, but overcome their fear.”⁠

A man of formidable intelligence Mr Navalny identified the two foundations on which Mr Putin has built his power fear and greed Not only did he understand those impulses he struck at them in devastating ways 

In one of his early communications from jail he wrote that it is not honest people who frighten the authoritiesbut those who are not afraid or to be more precise those who may be afraid but overcome their fear

"The list of the world’s biggest infrastructure snafus is long. But Britain has an entry that will prove hard to beat.⁠

Its High-Speed 2 railway line will achieve the unusual distinction of being both eye-wateringly expensive—it is expected to cost almost £300m ($376m) per kilometre of track—and largely pointless.⁠
⁠
The line, which is due to be operating in the early 2030s, will now only slightly speed up journeys between London and Birmingham, two cities that are already well-connected.⁠

"Alexei Navalny, who has died, was just an ordinary fellow. He was Everyman, every Russian; one of the hundreds of thousands whose voices were usually stifled and whose very existence the Kremlin ignored.⁠
⁠
When he made a speech, he didn’t fill it with literary quotes or references to history. He liked to sit down with people and talk about what worried them. He was no philosopher, just a jobbing lawyer, turned obsessive blogger, turned leading opponent of Vladimir Putin and his regime of crooks, thieves and murderers.⁠
⁠
He resisted everything they stood for: corruption, cronyism, greed, moral rot. For that opposition he knew he would be endlessly harassed, imprisoned and silenced—and possibly killed. But he was not afraid of death. ⁠

"Cats are not like diamond necklaces. For one thing, they have minds and legs of their own. “They are known to occasionally make themselves at home on other people’s sofas,” acknowledged a British government minister.⁠

The facts of feline behaviour have not deterred the government from backing a new bill that will make the “abduction” of a pet cat or dog punishable by up to five years in prison. The act of “inducing” a cat (perhaps with a tin of sardines) is also covered.⁠
⁠
The problem with the bill is not only that public fears of this act far outweigh its incidence. It is that stealing is already punishable by up to seven years in prison.⁠

"Even as ceasefire talks accelerate in the Middle East, the threat is building of a new and devastating level of violence. ⁠
⁠
Fears have been building of a massive Israeli army invasion of Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city along the border with Egypt, where 1m or more Palestinian are located. Any expansion of the fighting will have devastating consequences for civilians, detonate Israel’s relationship with Egypt and exhaust American patience. ⁠
⁠
Yet Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, says it may be necessary in order to achieve “total victory”. The city is Hamas’s last stronghold. The border by Egypt is also the main channel for arms smuggling. ⁠

In the run-up to Indonesia’s presidential election, the outgoing president has thrown his weight behind a former general with an appalling human-rights record and a professed ambivalence towards democracy, now the favourite to win. His running mate? Jokowi’s eldest son.⁠
⁠
Jokowi arrived in 2014 as a breath of fresh air. But by failing to entrench Indonesia’s democracy, even as he has strengthened its economy, he leaves behind a rotten smell. Tap the link in our bio to learn why.⁠

"Endometriosis is a painful and debilitating gynaecological condition that affects as many as 190m women worldwide. ⁠
⁠
In extreme cases adhesions can “bind” a woman’s organs together and freeze them in place. Milder cases come with severe pain, heavy menstruation, inflammation and scar tissue. ⁠
⁠
There is currently no known cure, and treatment focuses on controlling symptoms.⁠
⁠
It is estimated that endometriosis affects roughly the same proportion of women as the global population is affected by diabetes. But according to an expert, lack of research and awareness means understanding of endometriosis is languishing “30 to 40 years behind.”⁠

"The struggle to finance and build homes is contributing to a profound housing crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. ⁠
⁠
In almost all African countries even the very cheapest new home is too expensive for a typical teacher or police officer with the mortgage they could obtain, according to the Centre for Affordable Housing Finance in Africa, a research outfit in South Africa. Instead many Africans live in housing without toilets or reliable electricity. Some 230m people, half of all urban dwellers in Africa, live in slums.⁠
⁠
Yet Africa’s need for housing is also a tremendous opportunity. A mind-bending 70% of the buildings expected in the continent in 2040 do not exist, reckons the UN. Building them could be a boon not just for slum-dwellers but for growth, jobs and, potentially, climate-friendly construction.⁠

Yet this week Republicans in the House of Representatives went a step further and sabotaged their own policy priorities to hurt President Joe Biden. Their cynicism makes America weaker, and gives comfort to its enemies.⁠

For the past couple of years Republicans have made much of the chaos at the southern border, with good reason. But after a bipartisan group of senators worked on a border compromise broadly in line with what Republicans had sought, the House leadership turned around and rejected the thing they had previously asked for.⁠
⁠
It is no mystery why they did this: Donald Trump wants to win votes by playing up the border chaos. But the damage Republicans have done goes far beyond America’s own shores.

"The outlook in the Middle East seems dire. Iran’s allies in Lebanon are exchanging regular fire with Israel; and those in Syria, Iraq and Yemen are attacking American forces. ⁠
⁠
More than 27,000 Palestinians are reported dead in Gaza after four months of war, with most of the territory’s population being displaced, and facing disease and hunger. ⁠
⁠
Israel stands accused of genocide in the International Court of Justice. In the eyes of many, America’s reputation has also been stained by President Joe Biden’s military and political support for Israel’s quest to destroy Hamas.⁠
⁠
Yet as he shuttles between marbled Arab palaces and Israel’s humdrum political offices, Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, is seeking to turn the catastrophe of Gaza into an opportunity for peace. ⁠

"On paper, America should have no trouble restraining Iran. The former has a globe-striding army; the latter still relies on warships and fighter jets that predate the Moon landing. ⁠
⁠
In practice, though, Iran has proved devilishly difficult to deter. It is hard to put off insurgents and militias through air campaigns; their goals are attrition and survival, not well-ordered governance, and they are willing to sustain casualties.⁠
⁠
America’s struggle to deter Iran also stems from deeper contradictions in its Middle East policy. Its military presence is big enough to present a menu of targets but too small actually to constrain Iran.⁠

With Ukraine facing a major shortage of conventional artillery, FPV drones can help close the firepower gap. They perform tricks that artillery cannot, such as chasing vehicles or soldiers and flying into buildings or trenches. They offer psychological advantages too. ⁠

But even as he indulged in his dreams of serious composing, the much more celebrated part of his persona—a bibulous, cranky, chaotic remnant of the 18th century called P.D.Q. Bach—was touring the concert halls of America.⁠

His “Short-Tempered Clavier”, subtitled “Preludes and Fugues in All the Major and Minor Keys Except for the Really Hard Ones”, and raging “versus” concertos entertained audiences hugely along the way.⁠

The sport is simple. Two competitors, usually beefy men, slap each other. Hard. The bout typically ends when only one of them is conscious.⁠

As recently as a year ago the sport was obscure, watched largely on social media in eastern Europe. Now slap-­ﬁghting franchises are starting to hit the mainstream.⁠

"Prosthetic designers have long hoped to make their designs feel like extensions of the body rather than foreign objects attached to it.⁠
⁠
But scientists’ understanding of “embodiment”—the way in which a brain identifies with the body it is located in—has started to change.⁠
⁠
Recent developments in neuroscience suggest that the brain’s response to prosthetic limbs has little to do with how organic they look. That opens them up to all sorts of innovations in material, colour and form.⁠

And if prosthetics need not mimic the limb they are replacing, then they could be more than just replacements. Tap the link in our bio to discover how artists and engineers are experimenting with a range of body augmentations.⁠

Amid intense diplomacy, led by America and Saudi Arabia, a transformative deal is taking shape. It aims to use a proposed hostage-release to reset Israeli politics and open a path to a Palestinian state.⁠
⁠
Israel’s commitment to that would then be taken as the basis for a deal between it and Saudi Arabia, in which mutual recognition is underpinned by American security guarantees.⁠
⁠
Such an agreement would mark the biggest Arab commitment to peace in the Middle East in three decades—and could help end the agony in the region.⁠

"It was more like something from a spy thriller than a seminal political meeting, but Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party eventually settled on a decision to restore the province’s devolved government after a two-year absence. ⁠
⁠
The power-sharing government had collapsed when the DUP, the largest unionist (pro-British) party, walked out. ⁠
⁠
The party had been losing support among its base because Britain’s Brexit deal with the EU had established a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. ⁠
⁠
As the price of re-entering government, the DUP’s leader has secured a raft of further measures designed to reassure unionists that they remain British. ⁠

"Every 12 years, the electoral cycles of Mexico and the United States align. Last time it happened, in 2012, few took much notice. Things will be different this year.⁠
⁠
Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, is a relentless Mexico-basher, while the Mexican frontrunner, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a protegée of the populist incumbent Andrés Manuel López Obrador. ⁠
⁠
Mexico plays a central role in some of its northern neighbour’s most divisive issues. Border crossings are at record levels and the volume of fentanyl seized at the border is increasing faster than any other drug.⁠

Almost half of Republicans now see the country as an enemy, rather than an ally. Tap the link in our bio to discover why the debate in the United States on immigration policy may heighten tensions as the two countries prepare to go to the polls.⁠

"Tim Cook, boss of Apple, is having a rough start to 2024.⁠
⁠
In the past month his company has faced an unusual barrage of unpleasantness. A patent dispute forced it to remove features from two of its smartwatches. It found out that America’s Department of Justice would be suing it over antitrust transgressions. It reported that it was losing market share in smartphones in China, its second-biggest market.⁠
⁠
Adding insult to injury, a few Wall Street analysts said something that would have been unthinkable until recently—that Apple’s shares were overvalued. Earlier this month Microsoft, a rival tech titan, duly dethroned the iPhone-maker, temporarily, as the world’s most valuable company.⁠
⁠
The new year’s niggles point to larger challenges for the company. They fall into three broad categories: antitrust and legal issues; slowing iPhone sales; and growing geopolitical tensions.⁠

None of these is existential right now. But each carries with it a risk of causing a big upset. To find out which one is the most cause for concern, tap the link in our bio.⁠

Overseeing the relative calm in the West Bank—if not responsible for it—is the Palestinian Authority (PA). For decades Mahmoud Abbas, its president, has favoured negotiations to liberate Palestine, rejecting violent resistance. ⁠
⁠
Some Western and Arab governments now pin their hopes for Gaza’s future on the PA. They want to beef it up into a government that could pave the way to a Palestinian state, finally ending the conflict with Israel.⁠

"A decade or so ago private equity was a niche corner of finance; today it is a vast enterprise in its own right. ⁠
⁠
The industry’s terrain now includes infrastructure, property and loans made directly to companies, all under the broad label of “private assets”.⁠
⁠
Most recently, the kings of private equity—Apollo, Blackstone and KKR—have bought insurers or taken minority stakes in them in exchange for managing their assets. Smaller firms are following suit.⁠

Fundamentally, the strategy makes sense. Yet it also brings risks—and not just to the firms. Tap the link in our bio to discover why funding pension promises with private assets could create new ways to blow up the system.⁠

Many technologies have generated more hype than economic growth in the emerging world. Some people worry that generative artificial intelligence, too, will disappoint the global south. ⁠

Now she has changed her tune, particularly when it comes to land. Later this year she intends to introduce a new law that would toughen land-ownership reporting rules in Iowa. “American farmland should stay in American hands,” she says.⁠

Ms Reynolds joins a chorus of state and federal politicians who worry about Chinese land grabs. Over the past few years the number of states with restrictions on foreign ownership has grown from 14 to 24. ⁠

"Politicians share with estate agents a tendency to stretch the truth and skate over unpleasant details. ⁠

The resemblance extends to home ownership itself, where one of the animating ideas of housing policy is more fiction than truth. Ask a politician from any major party in Britain about property and the words “housing ladder” will crop up. ⁠

But their enthusiasm was tempered; owing to problems with its solar panels, the spacecraft appeared to have lost its ability to generate electricity.⁠

Japan nonetheless becomes the fifth country to achieve a moon landing. The mission’s success is encouraging for its space programme, after a string of setbacks last year.⁠

Less than a year ago rising rates caused Sil­icon Valley Bank and then First Republic to fail, the largest bank collapses since 2008.⁠

"Argentina’s new president has wasted no time. Forty-eight hours after taking office in December Javier Milei’s government unveiled measures to cut public spending by 3% of GDP. ⁠

He devalued the peso and pledged to slash subsidies. A week later Mr Milei decreed that state-owned companies could be privatised, price controls would be eliminated, and labour laws reformed.⁠

As well as striving for fiscal rectitude, Mr Milei is doggedly determined to destroy what he has dubbed “the caste”, a network of corrupt politicians, business cronies, media lapdogs and, most importantly, powerful unionists. ⁠

They had chronicled the sanitary state of London’s West End (routinely filthy) and its reading habits (also, at times, filthy).⁠

The question of how to count things is again in the air. The census, which has taken place since 1841, is under review; the government is due this year to decide whether to keep it or bin it. ⁠

"A nudge is not always enough to force change within an industry. Sometimes a series of forceful shoves is required. ⁠
⁠
In the rarified world of Western philanthropy, the shoves began in 2020.⁠

The covid­-19 pandemic, protests for racial justice across America and the outflow of refugees from Ukraine starting in early 2022 created a new urgency around charitable giving and revealed failings in how it worked. ⁠

Donors began to consider how they could disburse money faster and with more impact. The hope is that a new no-­strings approach—which some call “trust­-based philanthropy”—could help.⁠

Many economists think so. But in order for this to take place, companies need to spend big on new software, communications, factories and equipment, enabling AI to slot into their production processes.⁠

"When Europeans face a crisis beyond their shores, there is only one thing worse than not agreeing on what to say: not even being heard. ⁠
⁠
The war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has cruelly reminded Europe that, for all its talk of geopolitical clout, it is not treated in the region as an indispensable interlocutor. ⁠
⁠
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, was made to wait in his plane on the tarmac in Doha recently for 30 minutes until a Qatari minister turned up to welcome him. In December his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, had to scale back a would-be regional Middle East tour to just two Gulf cities. Britain and France have each sent naval vessels to the eastern Mediterranean, but this gesture has barely registered.⁠

Its leader, Xi Jinping, wants the country to become a hyper-advanced economy. His government is aggressively promoting the commercialisation of high technologies it likes, from electric vehicles to quantum computing. ⁠

"Most economic theories come and go with little fanfare. Every once in a while, however, one catches fire. ⁠
⁠
In 2015 Anne Case and Angus Deaton published a landmark study showing that from the late 1990s, after decades of decline, the mortality rate of white middle-aged Americans had started to rise—owing to a surge in alcohol-related deaths, fatal drug overdoses and suicides. ⁠
⁠
This “deaths-from-despair” mortality rate has not slowed: in 2022 more than 200,000 people died from alcohol, drugs or suicide. Yet even as this epidemic has intensified, its causes have grown harder to identify.⁠
⁠
As explanations for the causes of the deaths have evolved, so have theories about the populations most vulnerable to it. The Case-Deaton thesis centred on working-class whites. But our new analysis of mortality and demographic data shows that the devastation has spread beyond predominantly white cities such as Huntington, in West Virginia, to more diverse places like Baltimore, New Orleans and St Louis.⁠

"America’s Supreme Court is set to grapple with a clause that some believe disqualifies Donald Trump from becoming president again.⁠
⁠
The open question is whether the former president’s attempts to secure himself a second term despite losing the 2020 election—culminating in the riot at the Capitol three years ago—count as an insurrection and so disqualify him from trying to recapture the White House the old-fashioned way. ⁠

"Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter (since renamed X) has been a costly adventure for the serial entrepreneur: advertisers are retreating, and app downloads and user numbers appear to be falling. How has all that changed the site’s demography?⁠

Accounts linked to Republicans, however, increased by 0.8%. After the sale was completed six months later, we noted these trends had strengthened.⁠

Such big swings in follower numbers across many accounts usually indicate an operation to clean up “bots”—automated accounts controlled by software. But the vast majority of Republican accounts gained significant numbers of followers, which suggests a clean-up was not the cause. ⁠

"For three centuries whales have occupied a peculiar point where economics and the environment meet, their fortunes tracing the changing relationship between the two. ⁠
⁠
In the 19th century a drop in the demand for whale-based products worked to the whales’ benefit. But in the 20th century the supply became much cheaper and demand returned redoubled. ⁠
⁠
Whales became increasingly endangered until societies newly focused on the environmental costs of affluence imposed a worldwide whaling ban. That made them literally priceless.⁠
⁠
Now, after centuries of pricing a whale on the sale of products made from its carcass, economists are trying to assign value to its living presence. Tap the link in our bio to dive into the debate on the worth of a whale.⁠

For many people, writing is a slog. Words drip with difficulty onto the page—and frequently they seem to be the wrong ones, in the wrong order.⁠
⁠
Most first drafts are second-rate, so becoming a skilled rewriter is the thing.⁠

"Every day, screens around the world ﬁll with grim pictures from Gaza, where nearly 2m Palestinians have been forced out of their homes. ⁠

Even larger numbers have been displaced in Congo, Sudan, Syria and Ukraine. Most people feel compassion when they see fellow humans ﬂeeing from bombs, bullets or machetes. But many also experience another emotion: fear.⁠
⁠
Some worry that ever-swelling numbers of refugees and other migrants will surge across their borders. Nativist politicians talk of an “invasion”.⁠

Countries with lots of people tend to have bigger economies, but that does not mean that individual incomes are high. ⁠

They are most vulnerable when passing through narrow passages, such as the Strait of Malacca or the Panama Canal. So a recent surge of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, the only southern conduit into the Suez Canal, poses a grave threat to global trade. ⁠

"To heal the rifts in American politics in the lead-up to next year’s crucial election, American journalism urgently needs renewal. ⁠
⁠
Instead, in much of the mainstream media, journalism is in the grip of an illiberal bias. ⁠

That includes the New York Times, which is best-placed of any of the country’s newspapers to establish a common set of facts and frame of debate.⁠

In an essay this week James Bennet, a columnist at The Economist and a former editor at the the Times, argues that the paper’s pledge to pursue the news “without fear or favour” is no longer being honoured.⁠

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, will not imminently be sitting around the EU summit tables where such decisions are made. It will take several years, at least, for Ukraine to adopt the reforms needed to fulfil the EU’s exacting criteria to let in a new member.⁠

But the green light from the bloc’s 27 existing members is a strong signal of continued support for Ukraine’s war against Russia, and their commitment to help reconstruction after it.⁠

"How balanced is the American media?⁠
⁠
To answer that question, our data team analysed more than 600,000 pieces of written and television journalism. These charts show the results. ⁠

We found that there is an affinity between the media and the left, because journalists tend to prefer the language used by Democratic lawmakers. This disparity has grown since the start of Donald Trump’s presidency. As a result, the number of media sources covering politics in balanced language has dwindled.⁠
⁠
Of the 20 most-read news websites with available data, 17 use Democratic-linked terms more than Republican-linked ones. The same is true of America’s six leading news sources on TV, of which Fox is the only one where conservative language predominates.⁠

"The first mouthful of “cultivated” meat is both remarkable and dull. ⁠
⁠
In a kitchen at the California headquarters of Eat Just, a startup, a playing-card-sized slice of meat has been glazed and grilled. It is served with a sweet-potato puree, maitake mushrooms and some pickled peppers. ⁠

The meal is remarkable because the meat was grown in a lab, rather than on an animal. It is mundane because the texture, taste, look and smell of the meat is almost identical to that of chicken. And that, of course, is the point.⁠

The social network’s ad-stuffed newsfeed embodies the internet’s great trade-off: consumers enjoy free services, but must submit to bombardment with commercials from companies that know what they want.⁠

Yet increasingly, those with deep enough pockets are getting the chance to escape the online admen as social networks begin to offer customers ad-free subscriptions. ⁠

Social networks are not the only medium allowing the group that advertisers most covet—the better-off with money to splurge—to wriggle beyond their reach. But the admen are confident that they have other ways to reach valuable consumers. Tap the link in our bio to read why.⁠

"Sometimes you get the technicalities right but still flunk the test. ⁠
⁠
So it was at the congressional hearing on campus antisemitism last week. When asked if calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished at their schools, the presidents of Harvard, MIT and the University of Pennsylvania prevaricated.⁠
⁠
The presidents gave an accurate description of what is permissible under their schools’ speech codes, which closely track the First Amendment. But much of the blowback stems from the universities’ own lack of credibility when it comes to protecting free speech.⁠

"As the war in Ukraine nears its second anniversary, prices in Russia are accelerating—even as inflation eases elsewhere. ⁠

Inflation in prices of non-food consumer goods, many of which are imported, is in line with the pre-war average. But in the services sector inflation is exceptionally high. ⁠

The most striking finding is a surge in short sales—bets that a security’s price will fall—of an exchange-traded fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange under a ticker tracking an index of Israeli shares before the attacks.⁠

Then, on the first trading day after, standard “long” transactions outnumbered short sales by a similar number of shares. If these trades were made by the same investor, they would correspond to a $1m profit.⁠

"The world is “now recognising the value that India brings to the table”, writes S. Jaishankar, the country’s minister for external affairs.⁠

“India demonstrated during 2023 how to navigate the east-west polarisation around Ukraine and bridge the north-south developmental divide,” he argues in The World Ahead.⁠
⁠
“The impact of skewed globalisation, covid damage, conflict in Ukraine, big-power competition, climate events and now violence in the Middle East have certainly made the world far more volatile and unpredictable.” ⁠

"At last, good news from the Brazilian Amazon. ⁠

In the first eight months of 2023, the pace of deforestation has fallen by nearly 50% compared with last year. ⁠
⁠
This reflects a change of government. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president from 2019 to 2022, was an outspoken chum of the loggers and ranchers who are slicing down and burning the rainforest. Not only did he make no effort to stop them; he went out of his way to hobble the agencies charged with policing environmental crimes.⁠
⁠
His ejection by voters last year gave the Amazon a much-needed respite. His successor, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, actually cares about conservation.⁠

"Almost everyone agreed that the mid-2010s were a terrible time to be a worker.⁠

With the recovery from the global financial crisis of 2007-09 taking time, some 7% of the labour force in the OECD lacked work altogether. Wage growth was weak and income inequality seemed to be rising inexorably.⁠
⁠
How things change. In the rich world, workers now face a golden age. As societies age, labour is becoming scarcer and better rewarded, especially manual activity that is hard to replace with technology.⁠

Meanwhile AI is giving workers, particularly less skilled ones, a productivity boost, which could lead to higher wages, too. ⁠

They can separate the gullible from their money in New Age healing shops. But they can also serve as the light-harvesting layer in a solar panel, and they form the silicon used in microchips. ⁠

That diversity arises from the fact that “crystal” refers to a huge family of compounds, united only by having an atomic structure made of repeating units.⁠

The Republican had claimed, falsely, that his grandparents had fled the Holocaust and that his mother was at the Twin Towers when the 9/11 terrorist attacks took place. His CV was fiction. ⁠
⁠
In May 2023 Mr Santos was charged with money-laundering, theft of public funds and wire fraud; more charges were added in October. He has pleaded not guilty. ⁠
⁠
But on November 16th the House of Representatives Ethics Committee published a report alleging that he had “sought to fraudulently exploit every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal financial profit”. Mr Santos called the findings “a disgusting politicised smear” but said that he would not seek re-election next year for his New York seat. ⁠

As soon as this week Mr Santos may join the House’s most exclusive club: the ranks of members it has expelled. If it happens, it would set a modern precedent. Click on the link in our bio to read why.⁠

"It was in 1942, after Pearl Harbor, that Elinor Otto became a riveter, answering the American government’s call for women to do the jobs, especially in aircraft and armaments, that the men had left to go to war.⁠

In wartime, working mostly on the noses and fuselages of B­24 bombers, she felt completely absorbed in this huge thing, “working for victory”. Every rivet she fired into place made the planes stronger. She was deeply proud of that.⁠

"A company that holds an employee-appreciation day does not appreciate its employees. You’ve worked hard all year so you get a slice of cold pizza or a rock stamped with the words “You rock”?⁠
⁠
This approach reveals more about the beliefs of the relevant bosses than it does anything about what actually motivates people at work. ⁠
⁠
In a book published in 1960, called “The Human Side of Enterprise”, Douglas McGregor, a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, divided managers’ assumptions about workers into two categories. ⁠
⁠
Theory X managers believe that people have a natural aversion to work. Perks and pizza fit into this picture but pay is critical to theory X; work is the price to be paid for wages.⁠

Theory Y is based on a much more optimistic view of humans. Tap on the link in our bio to find out what it is—and whether it is a better principle for bosses to follow.⁠

"The build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has raised Earth’s temperature by about 1.2°C. It will go on rising until the accumulation stops, which is to say until annual additions are reduced to more or less zero. ⁠
⁠
That is why the governments of the world agreed to work towards that end at the Paris climate conference of 2015.⁠
⁠
But few of those who have mouthed commitments to net zero appreciate how central withdrawing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will be to achieving it. Even fewer recognise quite how vast the challenge is.⁠

New forms of durable removal need to be scaled up far more quickly. And they need to earn trust. To learn how a vital aspect of net zero is being systematically ignored, tap the link in our bio to read our latest special report.⁠

"When trees are cut down for timber a lot of the carbon they have stored up over decades or even centuries of growth is returned to the atmosphere. ⁠

The loss from a carefully felled and soon replanted area in a well-tended forest is less than when the same sort of area is slashed and burned. But it is all loss.⁠

However, instead of cutting down trees, timber businesses can enter the carbon “offsetting” market. By maintaining forest land, they can sell “offset” credits based on the idea that the emissions they are not making can now be made by someone else.⁠

"Jeremy Hunt argued that Britain’s economy had turned a corner as he unveiled an autumn statement that mostly comprised cuts to business and personal taxation. ⁠
⁠
According to the chancellor, lower inflation has given him the space to cut taxes. In reality that space has come from higher, not lower, inflation and from some questionable accounting.⁠
⁠
The single largest business tax cut in modern British history was announced. But not even a £450 reduction in tax for the median voter is likely to generate much of a feel-good factor—and it was hard to regard this as anything other than a pre-election giveaway.⁠

"The agreement at the conference of the parties (COP) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which took place in Paris in 2015, was somewhat impotent. ⁠

As many pointed out at the time, it could not tell countries what to do; it could not end the fossil-fuel age by fiat; it could not draw back the seas, placate the winds or dim the noonday sun. ⁠

But it could at least lay down the law for subsequent COPs, decreeing that this year’s summit—which begins in Dubai next week—should see the first “global stocktake” of what had and had not been done to bring the agreement’s overarching goals closer.⁠

"Javier Milei, Argentina’s newly elected president, rose to fame by bashing the country’s political class on television. ⁠
⁠
Now the world’s first avowedly libertarian leader will probably demonstrate the truth of the notion that it is easier to criticise than to do. ⁠

He was elected on a pledge to take a chainsaw to Argentina’s gargantuan state. His ill-defined plan to dollarise the economy could lead to higher inflation or perhaps even hyperinflation.⁠

"The meltdown at OpenAI following Sam Altman’s sudden ousting—and the subsequent announcement that he will be joining Microsoft—is the most dramatic manifestation yet of a wider divide in Silicon Valley. ⁠

On one side are the “doomers”, who believe that, left unchecked, artificial intelligence poses an existential risk to humanity and hence advocate stricter regulations. ⁠

Opposing them are “boomers”, who play down fears of an AI apocalypse and stress its potential to turbocharge progress. ⁠

By the mid-1960s America’s federal government was spending 0.6% of GDP on research funding. Inventions including the internet, GPS and space telescopes followed.⁠

But, that dynamism is fizzling out. A growing body of work shows that even as the world spends more on research, the bang for each extra buck has fallen.⁠

"The crisis at al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza is a tragedy in its own right. ⁠
⁠
If Israeli intelligence is correct, it is a legitimate military target. The laws of war state that once a hospital is used as a military facility—as Hamas probably has done—it may lose its special protection. ⁠
⁠
Using a hospital as a military base is a war crime. But is attacking the fighters using it as a shield a war crime too? ⁠
⁠

"Twenty years ago, syphilis seemed close to elimination in America. Yet today, syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia, three of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are hitting historic highs.⁠
⁠
STIs have plagued humans since Biblical times. But when HIV was first identified in the United States in 1981, it was particularly devastating. The fear of contracting HIV and dying from AIDS led to behavioural changes.⁠
⁠
But with the arrival of improved treatments for HIV, condoms fell out of favour. At the same time funding fell for clinics. Couple this with the rise of dating apps and the conditions were perfect for STIs to spread once again.⁠

"For every ten incoming rockets, Israel’s system of defensive mobile batteries, the Iron Dome, typically shoots down nine.⁠
⁠
However, it has its limitations. Chiefly cost.⁠

Israel’s defence ministry decided to build a new laser system, dubbed Iron Beam, last year. Operations were expected to begin in perhaps 2025, but with war now raging that timeline is being crunched. ⁠

Iron Beam is a technological marvel. After 10km of travel, one of its lasers reportedly has the diameter of a coin and is incredibly precise. But it has some constraints.⁠

Last month America suddenly removed almost all the restrictions it had imposed on Venezuela’s oil, banking and mining sectors for years. That is good news for oil traders: the country boasts the world’s largest proven oil reserves.⁠
⁠
The relief, initially for six months, was in recognition of an agreement which representatives of the regime of Nicolás Maduro had sealed the previous day, in Barbados, with the political opposition. The deal set out some conditions over how free and fair elections might be held next year.⁠
⁠
But alongside the opportunity, big risks remain. Click on the link in our bio to find out why. ⁠

"When China normalised relations with America and began opening its economy in 1979, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) was an ill­-equipped force designed to fight on its land borders. Even that was not something it did well. ⁠
⁠
Today, China boasts the world’s biggest army and navy, its third-­largest air force and one of its most potent arsenals of conventional missiles, including some that can hit America’s Pacific bases.⁠
⁠
And yet, seen from Beijing, the PLA is still far from being ready for war with America. To feel assured of victory in a conflict such as one over Taiwan, it must overcome several old problems.⁠

In a special report, Jeremy Page examines the vulnerabilities of the PLA. Tap the link in our bio to discover why he believes that while underestimating China’s armed forces would be dangerous, overestimating them would be too.⁠

More than a dozen North Korean embassies in all, about a quarter of the total, could reportedly follow soon.⁠

"To many Americans, Faneuil Hall is sacred ground. In the years leading to the American revolution, it was where Bostonians like Samuel Adams voiced dissent against what they saw as oppressive British policies. ⁠

Later it became a forum where anti­-slavery advocates held rallies and organised against fugitive-­slave laws. Suffragists also used Faneuil Hall to rally support for political and social rights for women.⁠

But the building, like much of American history, is scarred by slavery. Its construction was funded by, and named after, Peter Faneuil, a wealthy merchant who owned slaves and profited from the slave trade.⁠

Few people pay much attention to it. But at this year’s event, held in late October, subtle changes in rhetoric from top officials seemed to confirm a shift in the government’s thinking about the role of women in society.⁠

Xi Jinping, China’s leader, used most of his speech to talk about fertility and family. “We should actively foster a new type of marriage and childbearing culture,” he said. That is in keeping with his conservative view of society.⁠

"Inside the headquarters of one of the infantry brigades of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), operations officers co-ordinate search-and-destroy missions of Hamas tunnels from afar. ⁠
⁠
Two weeks after the launch of its ground offensive inside the Gaza Strip, Israel has around four divisions (somewhere around 10,000 troops) in the territory. ⁠
⁠
“This will be our only opportunity to finish off as much of Hamas’s underground network as we can,” says one of the officers, referring to the group’s 500km-long tunnel system. “We don’t know how long we have to operate and we need to make the most of it while we can.”⁠
⁠
Western support for Israel’s campaign is wavering. But Israel’s closest ally, America, has not yet demanded a ceasefire, so the IDF is wasting no time. ⁠
⁠
Israel’s army has, however, reached a point in its campaign where the Israeli government’s stated objectives–to destroy Hamas’s military infrastructure and to rescue the 239 hostages still held in Gaza–are in increasing tension.

"Visit a branch of Pedros, and at first glance the restaurant looks a lot like Nando’s. The aesthetic is vaguely Afro-Portuguese, with a giant Rooster of Barcelos painted on the wall. ⁠
⁠
Nando’s, South Africa’s spicy-chicken market leader, is facing competition from this plucky upstart. ⁠
⁠
Pedros is much, much cheaper. Yet Nando’s welcomes the competition, so its CEO claims.⁠
⁠
Perhaps the secret sauce of both businesses is, quite literally, their spicy sauce—along with the insight that there is no such thing as too much flame-grilled peri-peri chicken on the market.⁠

"If it’s election season in India, it’s time for giveaways. ⁠

At a rally earlier this month in one of five states holding elections this month, Narendra Modi announced that a pandemic-era scheme to provide 5kg of free grain a month to 800m of the poorest people would continue for the next five years. ⁠
⁠
As someone who had grown up in poverty, the prime minister said, it was his sacred duty to care for the poor.⁠

It gives Hamas’s fighters the ability to ambush Israeli troops, and to shelter from bombs and artillery.⁠

Israel’s stated goal is to destroy Hamas. Therefore its troops are trying to attack and destroy the tunnels. But subterranean fighting of this sort is notoriously hard and lethal work. ⁠

In the 1980s and 1990s rapid liberalisation was common, as countries formerly in the Soviet Union opened up, and many deemed unreformable, such as Ghana and Peru, proved they were in fact reformable. Politicians changed foreign-trade rules, fortified central banks, cut budget deficits and sold state-owned firms.⁠

"Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, spent the past few days shuttling across the Middle East, his second such trip since the start of the Gaza war on October 7th.⁠
⁠
His chilly reception in the region was one sign of mounting anger at Israel’s war in Gaza. Now in its second month, it has killed more than 10,000 Palestinians and damaged or destroyed more than 11% of the buildings in the enclave.⁠
⁠
Israeli generals still talk about waging a long campaign that will last up to a year. In practice, though, what Israeli officers call their “window of legitimacy” is probably far shorter. How fast that window closes will depend largely on America.⁠

So it is with “Tariff Man Part Two”. In the White House, Donald Trump put more new tariffs on American imports than any president in nearly a century. His thinking was simple: “I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so.”⁠

Mr Trump’s protectionism made America poorer, did little to help exporters and fed the inflation that the country is still struggling with. If he wins the Republican presidential nomination and goes on to win the election, he has vowed to ramp up things. ⁠

"On and on they trudged: a long column of outsiders, following a country lane towards the village of Jiuzi, ancestral home of Li Keqiang, China’s prime minister until his retirement earlier this year. ⁠
⁠
They were mourners, turning out in their hundreds, a few days after Li’s sudden death at the age of 68. ⁠
⁠
No Communist Party diktat had summoned these grieving citi­zens. Nor had convoys of buses brought them. Quite the opposite.⁠
⁠
Official media outlets have played down Li’s death. Instead, state media have devoted their efforts—as always—to extolling Xi Jinping. China’s leader has spent more than a decade concentrating power in his own hands, at the expense of government ministries and of Li, who oversaw them as prime minister. ⁠
⁠
In tributes to Li, some observers detect a challenge to Mr Xi and a yearning for a more reformist China. Tap the link in our bio to learn how many mourners are making a political point, whether they admit it or not. ⁠

Armies can struggle to pursue a single war aim without being blown off course. Israel is pursuing four of them, and they are in tension with each other. ⁠
⁠
Its forces have begun what on Saturday the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, called the second stage of the war—the ground invasion of Gaza. He warned that this phase will be “difficult and long” and he is right. ⁠
⁠
Israel’s leaders will continuously have to balance those four competing objectives. Striving harder for one may frustrate all the others.⁠

The American documentary film-maker’s latest series “The American Buffalo”, takes on a double tragedy: the wanton slaughter of the beasts living in the Great Plains during the late 19th century and the parallel near-extinction of the Native American tribes that evolved alongside these shaggy creatures for 10,000 years.⁠

"On Friday night the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) entered Gaza from two points: around Beit Hanoun, a town in the north, and Bureij, near the narrow midpoint of the 45km-long strip. ⁠
⁠
Relentless air strikes and artillery had provided cover for dozens of tanks and other armoured vehicles carrying infantry and combat-engineering troops.⁠
⁠
The incursion seemed bigger than the raids of the previous two nights. Still, it was hardly the division-sized attack that the Israeli army had been signalling for the past few weeks, since Hamas murdered more than 1,400 Israelis (mostly civilians) on October 7th.⁠
⁠
IDF officials have said the aims of the war remain unchanged: to isolate and destroy Hamas’s military infrastructure, particularly its network of underground tunnels, and to remove it from control of Gaza’s government. ⁠

"Politicians in rich countries find themselves in a tight bind when it comes to the green transition. ⁠

They need to switch their entire economies to low-carbon electricity to avert the worst consequences of climate change. But they worry that doing so will leave them geopolitically exposed.⁠

They fret in particular about batteries. Decarbonisation will require huge numbers of them, and the dominant technology is the lithium-ion battery.⁠
⁠

"It all began so fast. An unprecedented barrage of rockets served as cover for a murderous rampage by Hamas, which led to a frantic manhunt and ferocious air strikes. What began as a sleepy autumn weekend ended with Israel making ready to invade Gaza.⁠
⁠
Nearly three weeks after the October 7th massacre in Israel, however, that offensive has yet to begin. Officers grumble that they cannot maintain their readiness forever.⁠
⁠
There are many reasons to delay: continuing talks to free hostages held by Hamas; American pressure, motivated by fears of a regional war; the dire conditions inside Gaza; and the chronic dithering of Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s long-serving prime minister.⁠

Even a well-oiled government would struggle to navigate between so many competing priorities—and Israel, these days, barely has a government at all. Tap the link in our bio to read more.⁠

And it may indeed one day be seen as the first time global power-brokers sat down to discuss seriously what to do about a technology that may change the world.⁠

Efforts to rein in AI abound. Momentum for regulation in the EU, the White House and the G7 club of rich democracies stems from an unusual political economy. Incentives to act, and act together, are strong.⁠

Their routines incorporate stories about coming out to their conservative parents complaints about sexual harassment or immigrant hardships and even accounts of detention and abuse by Chinese police Most of their stories are funny Many are bittersweet

"Protecting American schoolchildren from gun violence is difficult. America is the only country in the world where people are outnumbered by civilian guns, and it is one of only three where bearing arms is a constitutional right.⁠
⁠
About 30 states allow staff to carry firearms on school grounds. With or without proper training, teachers across the country are carrying guns into schools, and some may not be thinking this through.⁠
⁠
A shooting class in Utah aims to bridge that gap. Since 2019 Sheriff Mike Smith of Utah County and his colleagues have taught teachers how to properly respond to an active shooter, as well as safely carry a concealed weapon.⁠

"About 200,000 women in sub-Saharan Africa die in childbirth every year, largely from bleeding, hypertensive disorders and infection.⁠
⁠
The World Health Organisation estimates that there are 545 deaths in the region for every 100,000 live births, a rate four times higher than in south Asia and 90 times higher than in western Europe.⁠
⁠
The rate in Africa has fallen by a third since 2000. As this chart shows, mortality has fallen by three-quarters in Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Rwanda and Sierra Leone. But there is still a way to go. In Nigeria, where a woman has a 1 in 19 chance of dying in childbirth over her lifetime, there has barely been any progress. ⁠
⁠
So what can be done? One of the best ways to reduce maternal deaths is to empower women. ⁠

With war raging in Israel as well as Ukraine, Joe Biden made an impassioned plea for America to act again as “the arsenal of democracy” by providing tens of billions of dollars of military aid to both allies. ⁠
⁠
The president drew a direct connection between Hamas’s slaughter of Israeli communities and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: they both want to completely annihilate a neighbouring democracy,” he said in a televised address to his country. ⁠

"During the golden age of globalisation, global poverty and inequality fell sharply.⁠
⁠
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Western companies which opened factories in the poor world often came under criticism. Yet these jobs usually paid above-average wages, and with better conditions.⁠
⁠
But now, enthusiasm for a more closed trading system could negatively affect the global poor. ⁠
⁠
Attempts by rich countries to produce more at home will deprive developing economies of lucrative employers. Poor governments do not have the fiscal firepower to offer subsidies on the scale of America or the European Union, so they are likely to lose out on trade and investment.⁠

"Nothing annoys a certain type of Briton more than the government standing between him and a painful death. ⁠
⁠
The phrase “nanny state” first appeared with the introduction of a 70mph speed limit on England’s motorways in 1965. ⁠
⁠
The former Conservative minister who invented the term would not have enjoyed this year’s party-conference season. Nanny has been busy. ⁠
⁠
Cigarettes are to be banned because smokers heap pressure on the NHS, says Rishi Sunak, the prime minister. The opposition party wants three- to five-year-olds to have tooth-brushing lessons. ⁠
⁠
These are policies aimed at protecting the state from the people, rather than people from themselves.⁠

"For countries that fail to seize the opportunity that a bulge in working-­age populations presents, the results can be grim.⁠
⁠
Thailand, for example, is rapidly greying. In 2021 the share of Thais aged 65 or over hit 14%, a threshold that is often used to define an aged society. ⁠
⁠
Soon Thailand will, like Japan, South Korea and most Western countries, see a dwindling supply of workers and, without extraordinary measures, flagging productivity and growth. ⁠
⁠
Yet unlike Japan and the rest, Thailand, is not a developed country. It has got old before it has got rich.⁠

"It was a bleak warning.⁠
⁠
Robert Gates, a former defence secretary who served Republican and Democratic presidents alike, recently said that America faces an unholy alliance of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, yet cannot muster a coherent response. ⁠
⁠
“Dysfunction has made American power erratic and unreliable, practically inviting risk-­prone autocrats to place dangerous bets—with potentially catastrophic consequences,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs.⁠
⁠
What has caused the disarray? It is partly that Republicans in the House hold only a narrow majority and are bitterly divided, not least over support for Ukraine. ⁠

"Just before midnight on October 12th Israel told the United Nations that the whole of northern Gaza, home to roughly 1.1m people, should be evacuated within 24 hours. ⁠
⁠
What started as an unspeakable crime on October 7th, when Palestinian militants crossed the border and murdered more than 1,300 Israelis, most of them civilians, may now lead to unimaginable catastrophe.⁠
⁠
The Israeli edict is probably a prelude to increased aerial bombardment, which has already killed more than 1,500 Gazans over the past week, and perhaps limited special-forces raids to hunt militant leaders.⁠
⁠
America may want Egypt to take in Palestinians. But the country is reluctant to accept them as refugees. Tap the link in our bio to discover why, even if many Palestinians do wish to flee, the evacuation will be a logistical nightmare.⁠

"The Polish election campaign has dripped vitriol. Both sides have accused the other of cronyism and treason, eagerly trading comparisons to Nazis and Soviets. Why has it been so nasty?⁠
⁠
The election is a toss-up. Mateusz Morawiecki’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, which is polling at 36%, is poised to take the largest share of the vote. But to form a government it will need the support of others, which it may not secure. ⁠
⁠
The stakes are unusually high. PiS has been in power for two terms. The opposition fears that another four years would allow the government to turn Poland into an authoritarian state, and take it out of the EU.⁠
⁠
In such a close race, turnout will be a deciding factor. But the election is also highly personal. Tap the link in our bio to discover how it plays into a feud that is almost as old as modern Poland itself.⁠

Nonetheless the danger of violence and war spreading to other fronts, especially Lebanon, is acute. The start of Israel’s expected ground operations in Gaza may be a trigger. ⁠
