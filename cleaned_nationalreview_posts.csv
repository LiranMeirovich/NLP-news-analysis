"Biden Is Riding the Bomb All the Way Down, Taking America with Him: Blehar

On the matter of Joe Biden, revealed as a mental and physical invalid to the world on June 27, who seems dead set on riding this bomb all the way to the ground ‚Äî the consequences be damned. 

Did you see the aftermath of the House Democratic Caucus meeting this morning, where the entire team got together to discuss ‚Äúthe Situation""? 

Watching the Democratic congressmen file out of their big ‚Äúget on the same page‚Äù conclave was like watching Redskins fans leaving RFK Stadium in 1985 after Lawrence Taylor snapped Joe Theismann's leg in half. (I have waited 39 years to deploy this analogy in an appropriate context.) 

Not one but multiple Democratic congressmen anonymously described the meeting to reporters as akin to a funeral. (Later, another anonymous Democratic representative disagreed: ‚ÄúThat is an insult to funerals.‚Äù)

And the reason for that is because Joe Biden is not dead ‚Äî at least not yet. 

He is very much alive and kicking, mounted astride the Democratic Party and pounding furiously on its empty hull, kicking against all attempts to pressure him to step down from the campaign or the presidency. 

He has made it clear to Democrats and donors alike that he would sooner see the entire party incinerated with him than quit this campaign. 

The ‚ÄúReplace Joe‚Äù boomlet is dying down now on Capitol Hill ‚Äî one imagines it will flare up again after the next inevitable gaffe, but the clock is running ‚Äî and Democrats are falling into bleak despair as they realize that, in slow steps over the past four years, they have unwittingly consummated a suicide pact with Joe Biden. 

One way or another, it seems, Biden will get his wish.

The Replace Joe boomlet is dying down now on Capitol Hill  one imagines it will flare up again after the next inevitable gaffe but the clock is running  and Democrats are falling into bleak despair as they realize that in slow steps over the past four years they have unwittingly consummated a suicide pact with Joe Biden 

One way or another it seems Biden will get his wish

"President Calvin Coolidge, July 05, 1926: ""About the Declaration there is a finality that is exceedingly restful. 

It is often asserted that the world has made a great deal of progress since 1776, that we have had new thoughts and new experiences which have given us a great advance over the people of that day, and that we may therefore very well discard their conclusions for something more modern. 

But that reasoning cannot be applied to this great charter. 

If all men are created equal, that is final. 
If they are endowed with inalienable rights, that is final. 
If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. 

No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions. 

If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their soundness, the only direction in which he can proceed historically is not forward, but backward toward the time when there was no equality, no rights of the individual, no rule of the people. 

Those who wish to proceed in that direction cannot lay claim to progress. They are reactionary. 

Their ideas are not more modern, but more ancient, than those of the Revolutionary fathers.""

"Contemplating the Unthinkable: Harris 2024

Link in bio for FULL STORY.

As these past few days have made abundantly clear, Biden‚Äôs age is the single biggest problem jeopardizing the Democrats‚Äô chances of keeping the White House. Never mind that a super-majority of Americans thinks Biden is too old to serve another term; a super-majority of Democrats thinks Biden is too old to serve another term, according to the latest polling from ABC News:

According to the poll, conducted using Ipsos‚Äô Knowledge Panel, 86% of Americans think Biden, 81, is too old to serve another term as president. That figure includes 59% of Americans who think both he and former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, are too old and 27% who think only Biden is too old. . . .

73% of Democrats think Biden is too old to serve.

This is a problem that cannot be fixed. Biden cannot get younger. There‚Äôs something a little sad about Democrats who think that the problem can be solved if the White House and Biden campaign staff just put the president in front of the cameras more:

Top party operatives are warning Biden aides that the president cannot retreat in response to the special counsel report that fueled concerns over his age and mental faculties. They say President Joe Biden, having largely shied away from interviews and press conferences, needs to be out in public far more.

Why do you think Biden‚Äôs public events are so few and far between, compared to a normal president‚Äôs? It‚Äôs because he can‚Äôt do them. If you put Biden out in public more, Americans are going to keep seeing what they‚Äôve been seeing. There is no sharper, quicker-witted, and more energetic Joe Biden hiding behind the curtain, waiting for the right moment to emerge. What you see is what you get.

"‚ÄúThomas Sowell is the only living human I care about meeting before he dies,‚Äù Wilfred Reilly writes in the new, monthly-format issue of National Review magazine.

Sowell is, as Reilly puts it, ‚Äúthe best known ‚Äòblack conservative‚Äô of his era.‚Äù He‚Äôs also ‚Äúone of the top ten social scientists,‚Äù and a man who ‚Äúinfluenced contemporary American discourse in a hundred ways ‚Äî especially for those of us on the right.‚Äù

In the battle against ideas such as those contained in works like Ibram X. Kendi‚Äôs How to Be an Antiracist, conservatives need to know Sowell‚Äôs writings and apply his insights. It‚Äôs for this reason that ‚Äî as Reilly puts it ‚Äî we should remember ‚ÄúWhy Thomas Sowell Matters.‚Äù

Also in the new November 2023 issue:

- Noah Rothman analyzes Hamas‚Äôs terror war on Israel and our increasingly dangerous world in ‚ÄúThe End of Pax Americana‚Äù
- Audrey Fahlberg, NR‚Äôs new politics reporter, looks at the ongoing chaos in the House Republican Caucus in ‚ÄúHope and Despair in the Post-McCarthy House‚Äù
- Aaron MacLean, a Marine veteran and scholar, explains ‚ÄúWhat Americans Need to Know about the Next War‚Äù
- Jack Butler reports from Ohio on pro-lifers‚Äô campaign against the Buckeye State‚Äôs looming pro-abortion referendum in ‚ÄúWill Ohio Enshrine a Right to Abortion?‚Äù
- Yuval Levin thinks through what could be the outlines of a new political coalition in ‚ÄúThe GOP Should Be the Party of Parents‚Äù
- and Jonah Goldberg makes his triumphant return to NR‚Äôs pages with an essay on our political dysfunction titled ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Wrong with Congress‚Äù

You might have noticed that I mentioned above that NR magazine is now a monthly. Yes, the change is here ‚Äî and we‚Äôre excited.

We‚Äôve spent a lot of time thinking about how we can create a magazine for the modern age ‚Äî an age of 24/7 Twitter-driven news cycles. Our new redesigned monthly format allows us to complement our daily coverage on National Review Online with a magazine that takes a longer view.

"Men at their best are protectors. 

We take on particular responsibilities, risks, burdens, and challenges because, on some level, we‚Äôre made for this. 

Being a dad means investing an enormous amount of your own soul in someone else.

Yes, we can find meaning in a lot of places in life ‚Äî romantic relationships, friendship, community, faith, work, art, the honing of a skill, travel, and discovery. 

And if you have a single- or double-income, no-kids life, and it works for you, God bless ya. 

But for most of us who have seen a small person emerge from our wife, fatherhood gives life unparalleled meaning. 

Buddy, it matters if we get out of bed in the morning, because somebody needs us. Parenthood, for a lot of us, may well be a de facto antidepressant ‚Äî not because you always feel good, but because you no longer have any time to sit around feeling bad. Your kids will always need you in one way or another ‚Äî first for bottle-feeding and diaper-changing, then as fellow pretend superheroes and to apply Band-Aids to skinned knees, and then, when they‚Äôre teenagers, as a free personal Uber service or, once in a great while, for unexpected deep talks about the meaning of life.

As those essays by the aged warn, the only people who will really remember the overtime you put in at the office will be your children. A lot of what we do on a day-to-day basis doesn‚Äôt matter much in the long run. That seemingly all-consuming work project, the striving for that big promotion, those intractable deadlines, that unexpected challenge that seemed so stressful ‚Äî in a decade or two, few will remember and even fewer will care.

"Pat Robertson, the Christian media mogul who held an influential role in developing the modern American Christian Right, died Thursday at 93, his broadcasting network announced.

Robertson transformed a small local television station into the global Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 1960, building a substantial audience and gaining influence on the Christian Right in the process. He also ran for president in 1988, finishing in third and winning four primary contests. He finished second in the Iowa caucuses, knocking eventual Republican nominee and former president George H.W. Bush to a third place finish.

Robertson died at his Virginia Beach home surrounded by his family. ‚ÄúMy father was an extraordinary man by any standard.

Concurrently with the fair are to be the Patriot Games, a series of competitions between high-school athletes from across the nation.

"From @kathrynjeanlopeznr: Thursday night we were present at the Reagan Library for the National Review Institute‚Äôs #buckleyprize dinner. 

@thelarrykudlow ‚Äî along with the @yaf_ ‚Äî was one of the honorees. 

Larry goes back with many of us. He goes back with National Review. He talked beautifully about how he experienced some of the hardest struggles of his life when he was on staff at NR ‚Äî ultimately beating an alcohol and drug addiction. He talked about how Bill and Pat Buckley ‚Äúwould look out for us.‚Äù

Kudlow's speech cut to who we are and who we need to be. On his best days, Bill Buckley saw everyone and everything through the lens of Christianity. I also believe that it is only the most radical elements of the Left who are so hostile to God and family, but they often use religion as a cover for that agenda. People of good will need to reclaim the best of who America is and needs to be.

Earlier, Larry made it clear that Bill was a supply-sider and a vehement anti-Communist. But what was the core? A creation grateful to his Creator, seeking to be a good and humble steward.

"Democrats may be anxious to declare victory over inflation, and the July inflation report, which showed 0 percent inflation month-over-month, gave President Biden the opportunity to shout ‚Äúzero inflation‚Äù for the world to hear. 

But the consumer-price index is still up 8.5 percent from a year ago. 

The prices of basic food staples show some of the highest increases in the CPI report. At breakfast, the price of eggs is up 38 percent year-over-year, and the price of cereal is up 16.4 percent. Coffee is up 20.3 percent, and milk is up 15.6 percent. 

All of these basic food categories are pulling inflation up, not pushing it down. 

The U.S. still has a ways to go before inflation ceases being the top economic problem.

The second problem is that Democrats antagonized many of the voters who turned to them in the 2018 elections to act as a check on Donald Trump. Democrats have, in a very short time, become associated with an extreme ideological fringe.

Joe Manchin has prevented each of these problems from being much, much worse than they are.

The leak speaks of the desperation of proabortion forces to preserve Roe and its guarantee of a radically proabortion regime everywhere in the United States It doesnt matter if it requires a breach of trust at the Supreme Court  indeed for many of them the Court as we know it isnt worth having if it doesnt uphold Roe

In the name of justice and equality, those animated by contempt and despair seek to destroy longstanding but fragile American institutions through which justice and equality can be secured. Destruction of these imperfect but necessary institutions will not hasten the advent of justice and equality but rather accelerate our collapse into barbarism and degradation.

This crisis is acute, and the hour is late. Like our forebears, we aim both to conserve and reform our institutions in light of enduring principles of justice. That is the task of self-governing people who know they live in an imperfect world and yet are not deterred by its challenges.

In the name of justice and equality those animated by contempt and despair seek to destroy longstanding but fragile American institutions through which justice and equality can be secured Destruction of these imperfect but necessary institutions will not hasten the advent of justice and equality but rather accelerate our collapse into barbarism and degradation

This crisis is acute and the hour is late Like our forebears we aim both to conserve and reform our institutions in light of enduring principles of justice That is the task of selfgoverning people who know they live in an imperfect world and yet are not deterred by its challenges

Given that the postal service delivers almost 3 billion pieces of mail a week, it is going to be able to handle any surge in mail-in voting, a proverbial drop in the bucket. What the postal service warned of last week is that some states have deadlines for mail-balloting that are too close to Election Day to allow a cushion for a reliable delivery.

Meanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi states flatly that President Trump is waging a ‚Äúcampaign to sabotage the election by manipulating the Postal Service to disenfranchise voters.‚Äù She calls Trump‚Äôs appointee, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy ‚Äúa complicit crony,‚Äù and says that his changes, according to the postal service itself, ‚Äúthreaten to deny the ability of eligible Americans to cast their votes through the mail in the upcoming elections in a timely fashion.‚Äù

"By the late 1980s, President Ronald Reagan had made three appointments to the Supreme Court. In 1989, the Court upheld restrictions on abortion passed by the Missouri legislature. Then President George H. W. Bush made two additional appointments. When the Court took up another abortion case during the term ending in 1992, many people expected that it would overturn Roe v. Wade.

It didn‚Äôt. Instead, three of the justices appointed by Reagan and Bush ‚Äî Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor, and David Souter ‚Äî wrote an opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey that reaffirmed Roe while also modifying it.

Pro-lifers were on the defensive in the run-up to the decision. Public support for legal abortion was rising. Previously pro-life politicians declared that they had undergone a change of heart. Pundits explained that if Roe was overturned, a sleeping pro-choice majority would awaken. Republican politicians would be placed in an impossible position. Their pro-life supporters would expect real action against abortion with the Supreme Court out of the way, but the Republicans could not deliver on those promises without a public backlash.

That political backdrop, it has often been suggested, played a role in the outcome of Casey.

"On the Fourth of July, as Patrick Morrisey marched down Main Street with supporters who waved red-white-and-blue placards for his Senate campaign, someone on a porch shouted at him: ‚ÄúNew Jersey!‚Äù It was a putdown ‚Äî an accusation that Morrisey doesn‚Äôt deserve a place in West Virginia‚Äôs public life because he grew up somewhere else. The winner of two statewide elections for attorney general, Morrisey heard the remark, smiled, and waved.

Manchin appears to lead in the polls, too.

Morrisey may be the underdog, but he‚Äôs likely to catch up and turn his race into one of the most watched Senate contests of 2018, as Republicans try to defend their slim majority in the chamber by gaining a seat now held by a Democrat in deepest Trump country. On July 3, in fact, President Trump traveled to a resort in West Virginia to deliver a speech in conjunction with ‚ÄúA Military Tribute at the Greenbrier,‚Äù a golf tournament. There, he praised Morrisey as ‚Äúa tough, strong guy‚Äù who ‚Äúloves the people of West Virginia.‚Äù The next day in Ripley, Morrisey wore a blue shirt and a red hat, both featuring the tribute tournament‚Äôs logo ‚Äî and talked, with everybody who wanted to hear, about seeing the president.

"To summarize all too briefly, Carl von Clausewitz viewed land war as the ultimate expression of international politics. Alfred T. Mahan felt that competitions between great powers were played out decisively in great ship battles at sea. Julian Corbet attempted to bridge the gap between the first two and declared that naval forces existed to aid and assist land forces engaged in decisive operations ashore. Lastly, Halford Mackinder, the great geographer-strategist, advanced his ‚Äúheartland‚Äù theory, asserting that land geography and territorial resources determined the outcomes of great-power competitions.

China has recast the sea as the new global ‚Äúheartland‚Äù and as the arena of a great-power competition that can be fought and won from land. It should not come as a surprise to those familiar with China, with its many ‚Äúgreat walls‚Äù built over a 3,000-year recorded history, that it is attempting to create a technological wall across the sea. It is also seeking to re-create its unique vision of itself in the world.",2018-07-19 22:52:50,"To summarize all too briefly Carl von Clausewitz viewed land war as the ultimate expression of international politics Alfred T Mahan felt that competitions between great powers were played out decisively in great ship battles at sea Julian Corbet attempted to bridge the gap between the first two and declared that naval forces existed to aid and assist land forces engaged in decisive operations ashore Lastly Halford Mackinder the great geographerstrategist advanced his heartland theory asserting that land geography and territorial resources determined the outcomes of greatpower competitions

"The California paradox ‚Äî communitarianism in public government but hedonism in self-government, leading to tribalism in politics and excessive cultural optimism ‚Äî has flummoxed conservatives. The confusion is forgivable. Californians approved initiatives legalizing marijuana and expediting capital punishment on the same ballot in 2016. Yet California has always been communitarian in government precisely because it is hedonistic and solidarity-free in its culture. It may be the only state where Barney Frank‚Äôs inane bromide that ‚Äúgovernment is simply the name we give to the things we choose to do together‚Äù is actually true. Government is indeed the only thing Californians do together; most people are just in it for the weather, after all.

"A recent study showed that the grip strength of a sample of college men had declined significantly between 1985 and 2016. Indeed, the grip strength of the sample of college men had declined so much ‚Äî from 117 pounds of force to 98 ‚Äî that it now matched that of older Millennial women. In other words, the average college male had no more hand strength than a 30-year-old mom.

"In the early days of National Review, the quintessential liberal Democrat Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. was so incautious as to enter an NR contest under his own name. The high-spirited editors (from left to right: Suzanne La Follette, Jim Burnham, Willmoore Kendall, Bill Buckley) thought to send him this small mascot of his party as a reward. They sent Donkey Arthur to his namesake in Cambridge by railway express -- only to have Professor Schlesinger indignantly return him. There was some worry about what to do next until Jim Buckley -- Bill and Priscilla‚Äôs brother, the future U.S. senator and federal judge -- said the donkey would be a perfect pet for his children. And so Arthur spent the rest of his days happily in Sharon, Connecticut.",2014-11-20 01:38:01,In the early days of National Review the quintessential liberal Democrat Arthur M Schlesinger Jr was so incautious as to enter an NR contest under his own name The highspirited editors from left to right Suzanne La Follette Jim Burnham Willmoore Kendall Bill Buckley thought to send him this small mascot of his party as a reward They sent Donkey Arthur to his namesake in Cambridge by railway express  only to have Professor Schlesinger indignantly return him There was some worry about what to do next until Jim Buckley  Bill and Priscillas brother the future US senator and federal judge  said the donkey would be a perfect pet for his children And so Arthur spent the rest of his days happily in Sharon Connecticut
