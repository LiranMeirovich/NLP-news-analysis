"""Sean was a superb writer of comedy, a clever and rigorous practitioner of the art, who saw it as something to be crafted, to be treated almost like poetry.""

For our end-of-year special series paying tribute to cultural figures we lost in 2021, comedian Bill Bailey recalls more than 30 years of friendship with Sean Lock - a warm and generous writer and performer whose standup sets left audiences ""helpless with laughter"".

""I met Sean at a gig where we were both performing in the late 80s and we immediately hit it off,"" says Bailey. ""We shared a similar sense of humour, and also a sense of outsider status which gave us an added spur to succeed but with a determination to have fun while doing it.

""The fact that we were able to make people laugh, and make a living from it, felt like we were on a wild adventure that we didn’t want to end.

""Away from the world of TV and entertainment, he was a dedicated and loving family man. He was a great host, an excellent cook, and was never happier than pottering around in the kitchen preparing a fish stew, while dancing to dub reggae.

""Sean had that rare knack of truly great comics to be able to take audiences with him on ever more tortuous and often quite dark routes, yet such was the warmth of his personality and easy manner that crowds happily followed along, and his reputation grew.""

""He was as funny off stage as on. I will remember a kind, generous and loyal friend who I loved dearly, and feel a great sadness at his loss. He leaves a wife, Anoushka, and their three children, his sister Kate and his brothers Paul and Pete. And he leaves us all a wonderful comic legacy and – for me and those lucky enough to have known him – some cherished memories and unforgettable nights of laughter.""",2021-12-18 15:00:06,"Sean was a superb writer of comedy a clever and rigorous practitioner of the art who saw it as something to be crafted to be treated almost like poetry

"“The world knew him as Gunther … but Michael’s loved ones knew him as an actor, musician, cancer-awareness advocate, and loving husband.""

James Michael Tyler has died at the age of 59.

Tyler, most famous for playing Gunther, the manager of Central Perk in the hit sitcom Friends, announced in June that he had stage 4 prostate cancer, which was diagnosed in 2018.

His family statement continued, saying: “Michael loved live music, cheering on his Clemson Tigers, and would often find himself in fun and unplanned adventures. If you met him once you made a friend for life.”

Friends co stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox have also paid tribute to their co-star. “Friends would not have been the same without you. Thank you for the laughter you brought to the show and to all of our lives. You will be so missed,” Aniston, who played Gunther’s unrequited love interest on the show, said in an Instagram post.

Cox followed shortly after, writing: “The size of gratitude you brought into the room and showed every day on set is the size of the gratitude I hold for having known you. Rest In peace James.”

In May, Tyler had appeared on Friends: The Reunion but was unable to attend in person due to his health issues. Appearing instead via Zoom, he said: “It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly.

“I could not have imagined just a better experience. All these guys were fantastic and just a joy to work with. It felt very, very special.”

Tyler said he didn’t reveal his illness before then because: “I didn’t want it to be like ‘Oh, and by the way, Gunther has cancer’.”

Tributes have poured in across social media, with some remembering the actor as the “seventh friend” due to his regular presence on the hit show.

Kevin Bright, former executive producer of Friends, tweeted: “James Michael Tyler Our Gunther passed away last night. He was an incredible person who spent his final days helping others. God bless you James, Gunther lives forever.”

"“Funny, brave, fearless, kind”

Tributes have been pouring in for Paul O’Grady, the beloved TV host and comedian, who has died at the age of 67.

His partner Andre Portasio confirmed in a statement that O’Grady died “unexpectedly but peacefully” on Tuesday evening.

Portasio said: “He will be greatly missed by his loved ones, friends, family, animals and all those who enjoyed his humour, wit and compassion.

“I know that he would want me to thank you for all the love you have shown him over the years.”

O’Grady was best known for hosting Bafta-winning talkshow The Paul O’Grady Show, Blankety Blank, the reboot of Blind Date, and also for his drag queen persona Lily Savage, which saw him first break on to comedy the scene.

Tributes poured in early on Wednesday. “Such sad news,” TV presenter Lorraine Kelly wrote on Twitter. “Paul O’Grady - funny, fearless, brave, kind and wise ... I always think dogs are the best judge of character and they ADORED him.”

LGBTQ+ rights campaigner Peter Tatchell remembered O’Grady as “one of the loveliest people you could ever meet ...""

A well-known animal lover who kept dogs, pigs, bats, ferrets and more at his farm in Kent, O’Grady also presented the award-winning show For The Love Of Dogs. He won an RSPCA Animal Hero award for his “outstanding contribution to animal welfare”.

Throughout his career he was famously outspoken about the neglect of care workers, austerity and the Tory party: he made headlines when he said he wanted to see David Cameron and George Osborne’s “heads on spikes on Tower Bridge” over austerity cuts, and revealed that he quit his talkshow because celebrities were so dull they were like “relatives you felt obliged to visit”.

O’Grady wrote a four-volume memoir and in 2008 he was awarded an MBE for his services to entertainment. When described as a national treasure in an interview with the Observer in 2017, he responded: “Oh, what a terrible phrase. That wasn’t planned.”

"Dua Lipa topped the winners at the 2021 Brit awards, calling for the UK prime minister to approve “a fair pay rise” for frontline NHS staff as she picked up two gongs last night, including female solo artist.

Addressing the 2,500 key workers given tickets to the show, she said: “It’s very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them.""

Each year this century, at least half of the winners in the mixed-gender categories have been men, but in 2021, six out of seven are women.

Little Mix became the first all-female band to win the British group award, with Five Star in 1987, Stereo MCs in 1994 and Gorillaz in 2018 the only previous category winners to feature women.

Leigh-Anne Pinnock said on receiving the award: “It’s not easy being a female in the UK pop industry. We’ve seen the white male dominance, misogyny, sexism and lack of diversity. We’re proud of how we’ve stuck together, stood our ground, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever.”

Los Angeles trio Haim won international group, the first all-female group to do so in nearly two decades following Destiny’s Child’s win in 2002. Billie Eilish won international female, Arlo Parks won breakthrough artist and pop singer Griff won the rising star award.

Taylor Swift became the first woman to receive the global icon award, previously won by David Bowie, Elton John and Robbie Williams. “There is no career path that comes free of negativity,” she said on receiving the award in person. “If you’re met with resistance that probably means that you’re doing something new.”

Meanwhile, best British single went to Harry Styles for his song Watermelon Sugar, an enduring hit since its release in November 2019.

He also addressed the key workers in the audience, saying: “​Thank you for everything you did for this country”, while Headie One and AJ Tracey added new lyrics to their hit track Ain’t It Different, rapping: “Team work keeps the dream working, it’s only right we show love to the key workers.”

The pair also got in a jab against Boris Johnson’s government, “saying eat out to help out but won’t help out [Marcus] Rashford when he’s feeding the youths.”",2021-05-12 16:01:03,"Dua Lipa topped the winners at the 2021 Brit awards calling for the UK prime minister to approve a fair pay rise for frontline NHS staff as she picked up two gongs last night including female solo artist

"Picture this: you're 18, taking in the sights of New York City and then you spot it ... a huge billboard of yourself celebrating the biggest win of your career.

That's what today looked like for US Open champion Emma Raducanu.

She emerged from her hotel, following three weeks of experiencing the city primarily through Uber Eats, having made tennis history. Keen to do some sightseeing after becoming the first British woman to win a grand slam in 44 years, the teenager stepped out and was met with a giant poster of her triumph.

In three months, she has gone from being a student waiting for her A-level results to reaching the last 16 at Wimbledon and then, in unprecedented fashion, to winning 10 straight matches to qualify for the main draw at the US Open and then go all the way to the title.

Born in Toronto, when @emmaraducanu was two her family moved to south-east London, England. “I think that the calmness and the mental strength definitely comes from my upbringing,” she said following her victory over Leyla Fernandez on Saturday.

Raducanu was introduced to tennis by her parents at the age of five, and enjoyed ballet, horse riding, swimming, go-karting and motocross, and her love of cars helped her relax between matches at the US Open as she watched the Dutch Grand Prix.

And when she played in Chicago just before winning her first grand slam, Raducanu revealed her love of architecture, finding time to visit “the Bean”, Anish Kapoor’s sculpture.

For many players, it can be easy to forget that there is life outside the tennis bubble, other things to keep your mind occupied and settled. But Raducanu’s secret seems to be to embrace everything, from culture to food, friends and family to travel, music to F1.

“I definitely think it’s the time to just switch off from any future thoughts or any plans, any schedule,” she said after her win, when asked where she would be playing next. “I’ve got absolutely no clue. Right now, no care in the world, I’m just loving life.”

"Carl Nassib has become the first active NFL player to come out as gay.

In a video posted to Instagram on Monday, @carlnassib said: 'I just wanted to take a quick moment to say that I’m gay. I’ve been meaning to do this for a while now but finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest,' said the Las Vegas Raiders defensive end.

Nassib, 28, also announced a $100,000 donation to the Trevor Project, which works to prevent suicides among LGBTQ+ youth in America.

NFL players and coaches were quick to applaud Nassib’s bravery. “I learned a long time ago what makes a man different is what makes him great,” Raiders coach Jon Gruden told ESPN.

Current and former players have also hailed the announcement. Hall of fame quarterback Warren Moon tweeted: “Really proud of Carl Nassib. The first active football player to ever do so. I played with several guys who never were comfortable enough to go public. They were great teammates, & obviously very talented.”

"The world of sport has united to offer praise and support to Jake Daniels, after the 17-year-old ended decades of silence within men’s football to become the first player in the UK to come out as gay since Justin Fashanu in 1990.

Daniels said he has been aware of his sexuality since he was six years old, but kept it secret as he pursued his dream of a career in football.

But the teenager, who made his senior debut for @blackpoolfc only this month, says he is now ready to act as a role model for others in the game after deciding “the time is right to be myself, be free and be confident” in his identity.

“For a long time I’ve thought I would have to hide my truth because I wanted to be, and now I am, a professional footballer,” @officialjakedaniels said. 

“However, I knew that would lead to a long time of lying and not being able to be myself or lead the life that I want to. Since I’ve come out to my family, my club and my teammates, that period of overthinking everything and the stress it created has gone.""

Daniels’s revelation is a striking landmark that comes when men’s football is more engaged with social issues than in any recent time, but still unable to cite progress in LGBTQ+ representation within the game.

Last year Adelaide United’s @joshua.cavallo became the only male top-flight professional footballer in the world to come out as gay, but others are yet to follow. 

In English football specifically, the shadow of the talented and unfulfilled Fashanu still lingers over the game. The England international came out at the end of his career and was to take his own life eight years later, in 1998.

Amal Fashanu, Justin’s niece, who runs a charitable foundation in his name, said that Daniels’s decision would “come as a huge comfort to the many footballers at all levels of the game still secretly living as gay and who still feel unable to come out”.

“If my Uncle Justin were alive I know he would have been one of the first people to have contacted Jake to offer his support and best wishes,” she said. “Justin’s wish was to create a society where people could simply be kinder to one another and where bigotry doesn’t exist.”

"What are your thoughts on these new immigration rules?

Oscar winners, Nobel prize recipients and Brit award-winners are just some of the foreign nationals who will be fast-tracked for UK visas under a tweak to immigration rules announced by the Home Office.

An existing 'global talent' route was introduced in 2020 which supplies visas for leader or potential leaders in academia, arts and culture, or digital technology. This tweak streamlines the route for people who have won prestigious prizes.

This is part of Home Secretary Priti Patel's Australian-style points system - a move which closes the door to low-skilled workers including those in hospitality, care, and agriculture.

""This is exactly what our new point-based immigration system was designed for – attracting the best and brightest based on the skills and talent they have, not where they’ve come from,"" Patel said.

The awards cover science, technology, maths, engineering, music, film, acting, and literature. However the rules cover very specific categories within these award. It is only an Oscar in a leading acting or directorial role which will be favoured, and with literature, only the Nobel prize is accepted.

For music, possible routes include a best international male or female award at the Brits, best international act at the Mobo awards, or a Grammy for lifetime achievement.

Meanwhile, new Guardian analysis reveals EU member states have used illegal operations to push back at least 40,000 asylum seekers from Europe’s borders during the pandemic, methods being linked to the death of more than 2,000 people.",2021-05-06 14:54:15,"What are your thoughts on these new immigration rules

"But what about yellow? 

To encourage better respect towards people’s boundaries, US event organizers are using colored accessories to help people communicate their comfort around physical touch.

As coronavirus restrictions continue to be lifted, many people have become less comfortable with physical acts of socializing – hugs, handshakes and everything in between.

While some are excited to begin up-close-and-personal socializing, others are fiercely protective of their physical space.

Hence, the creation of the color-coded accessories, sometimes stickers, lanyards or bracelets, to differentiate who is comfortable with what kind of touch.

Hosts of an event in Virginia handed out red, yellow, and green stickers to attendees, explaining that red means no physical contact wanted, yellow stickers are only OK with elbow contact, and green means that hugs are welcome.

"Michelle Yeoh has won best actress Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once.

Born in Malaysia, Yeoh becomes the first person of south-east Asian descent to win the best actress Oscar for her role as laundromat manager Evelyn Wang, who stumbles across a “multiverse” of alternative realities. Yeoh defeated strong competition for the award, including Cate Blanchett for Tár and Michelle Williams for The Fabelmans.

Yeoh has already attracted considerable attention during the awards season for Everything Everywhere All at Once, including a Bafta nomination for best actress, and wins for the Golden Globe for best actress in a film (comedy or musical), and best actress at the Screen Actors Guild awards.

She finished her acceptance speech with: “And ladies: don’t let anybody ever tell you you are past your prime.”

This curious California sea lion, captured by Simon Biddie, is one of the winners of the third @fondationprincealbert2 Environmental Photography awards.

California sea lions enjoy protected status in Espiritu Santo national park in Mexico, which is a no-fishing zone and places limits on human activity. However, the looming climate crisis still poses a threat to their population.

This annual award was created to celebrate the incredible beauty of our planet and highlight the environmental challenges we face.

"An experiment that hung rhinos upside-down to see if it was better for the animals has been awarded one of this year's Ig Nobel prizes.

Groundbreaking studies into how well beards soften punches to the face, as well as orgasms as a nasal decongestant were honoured on Thursday night with one of the most coveted awards in science.

Not to be confused with the more prestigious – and lucrative – Nobel awards, to be announced from Stockholm and Oslo next month, the Ig Nobels celebrate the quirkier realms of science, rewarding research that first makes people laugh and then makes them think.

The transportation prize went to a group that found airlifting tranquilised rhinoceroses upside down is probably better for them than carrying them on their sides in slings.

Wildlife veterinarian Robin Radcliffe, from Cornell University, and colleagues hung 12 rhinos upside-down for 10 minutes in Namibia because they wanted to know if the health of the animals might be compromised when slung by their legs beneath a helicopter.

Rhinos are being increasingly transported in African conservation efforts to shift the animals between fragmented habitats. This study wanted to ensure that the upside-down methods being used were safe.

The scientist looked at the tranquillised animals' heart and lung function while being carried upside down and found there was evidence that it was better than lying chest down or on their side.

""This has really changed rhino translocation, and even more so elephant translocation. Picking these big animals up by their feet - it's now accepted. The next thing we've got to do is some research on other species like buffalo, hippo, and maybe even giraffe,"" said team-member and wildlife doctor Pete Morkel to BBC News.

"Like all elite athletes, Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins, 105, has a ruthless streak. So, despite setting a 100m world record last weekend at the Louisiana Senior Games, she still wants to go faster.

“It was wonderful to see so many family members and friends. But I wanted to do it in less than a minute,” she said after the race, where she recorded a time of 1:02:95, a record for women in the 105+ age category. When someone pointed out that 102 is less than her age and asked if that made her feel better, Hawkins answered: “No”.

The retired teacher is no stranger to athletic excellence. She started competing at the National Senior Games when she was 80, specialising in cycling time trials, and won several gold medals. She eventually ended her cycling career saying that “there wasn’t anyone left my age to compete with”.

When she turned 100 she took up sprinting. In 2017 she set the 100m world record for women over the age of 100 with a time of 39:62. When her record was broken in September by Diane Friedman, Hawkins decided to compete in a new age category.

“I love to run, and I love being an inspiration to others,” Hawkins said. “I want to keep running as long as I can. My message to others is that you have to stay active if you want to be healthy and happy as you age.”

What's your message to Hawkins?

"Canadian footballer Quinn has made history becoming the first out transgender, non-binary athlete to win an Olympic medal.

In a thrilling match that went all the way to penalties, Canada defeated Sweden at the Yokohama Stadium; the country's first ever gold medal in football.

@thequinny5 won bronze with Team Canada in Rio in 2016, but they hadn’t yet come out. Last year, they announced they were transgender, that they use they/them pronouns and that they would take Quinn as their full name, saying on Instagram: “I want to be visible to queer folks who don’t see people like them on their feed. I know it saved my life years ago.”

Speaking to Canadian news outlet CBC, after winning gold with their teammates on Friday, Quinn said; “I’m so proud of my team. They’re my best friends. I’m so glad we’re bringing back a better medal than bronze.""

In Tokyo, Quinn is one of at least three transgender and/or non-binary athletes competing. New Zealand’s Laurel Hubbard, a transgender woman, competed in the 87kg weightlifting - and Alana Smith, a non-binary skateboarder, competed in the women’s street competition. Chelsea Wolfe, a trans woman, also traveled to Tokyo with Team USA to the BMX competition as an alternate.

Quinn was the first of the trans and non-binary athletes to compete in Tokyo. Writing about their feelings at the start of the historic games, they said on Instagram: ""I feel proud seeing ‘Quinn’ up on the lineup and on my accreditation. I feel sad knowing there were Olympians before me unable to live their truth because of the world.

They continued: “I feel optimistic for change. Change in legislature. Changes in rules, structures, and mindsets. Mostly, I feel aware of the realities. Trans girls being banned from sports. Trans women facing discrimination and bias while trying to pursue their Olympic dreams. The fight isn’t close to over … and I’ll celebrate when we’re all here.”

"It doesn't look like your usual protest but this is how the Netherlands staged a national demonstration against lockdown measures which allowed gyms and beauty salons to open but not cultural venues.

Dozens of famous theatres and galleries welcomed hairdressers and beauticians whilst also hosting performances.

“After nearly two years of uncertainty, performers and musicians need perspective,” said Dominik Winterling, the new managing director of the Concertgebouw.

""We simply don't know what's going on … what we really want is to play for an audience because that's what we're there for. We want to inspire people. That's what it's about.”

In a Twitter post, junior culture minister Gunay Uslu voiced understanding for the protest but urged caution.

""The cultural sector is drawing attention to their situation in a creative way. I understand the cry for help and that artists want to show all the beautiful things they have to offer us. But the opening of society must go step by step. Culture is high on the agenda.""

In the Netherlands, new covid infections have been hitting near-daily records above 30,000. The country has recorded more than 3.5 million infections and 21,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Hospital numbers have been steadily declining.

"She was a pioneer and a rule-breaker, an educator, community leader and race relations campaigner who met Nelson Mandela and rubbed shoulders with royalty – but always had time to call out the bingo numbers at a local event or sign a passport photo.

In bright sunshine on Wednesday, a choir from the school Betty Campbell led with distinction sang her favourite song, Something Inside So Strong, as a huge bronze monument to her was unveiled in a Cardiff city centre square.

Campbell was the first black woman to become a headteacher in Wales.

Under her leadership, Mount Stuart primary in Butetown, Cardiff, became a model for best practice in equality and multicultural education throughout the UK.

But the joyful unveiling was also important because the monument is the first statue of a real, named woman set up in an open-air public space in Wales.

Campbell’s daughter, Elaine Clarke, said her mother, who died in 2017 aged 82, would have been proud of the monument.

She recalled how as a child growing up in the Tiger Bay area of Cardiff, Campbell had been told that a black working-class woman could never reach the academic heights to which she aspired – but she had proved them wrong.

“This sculpture encapsulates Betty’s legacy of determination, aspiration and inspiration,” she said.

Campbell's family were present at the unveiling, including great granddaughter Ezrae Campbell, who can be seen sitting on the base of the statue on the last slide of this post.

Granddaughter, Michelle Campbell-Davies, said there were still too few teachers of colour and the education system was letting down students from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. But she called the statue a “beacon of hope.”

“Seeing a statue of a black Welsh woman means that change can happen.""

"“They’re not these mindless killers, but we just happen to look like their food.""

New research by Australian scientists has supported the theory that great white sharks do not actively seek out humans as prey.

The study says that on the rare occasion the apex predator attacks a human, the bite may be the result of mistaken identity, because they may not be able to visually distinguish surfers and swimmers at the water’s surface from their natural prey.

The team @macquarieuni compared video footage of swimmers, people paddling surfboards, and seals from the perspective of a great white shark viewing from below in the water.

Taking into account what a shark is likely to see when looking up at a person or seal against the background skylight, the researchers concluded that neither the silhouette shape nor motion cues were enough for a shark to clearly tell them apart.

Great whites are thought to be more successful in hunting prey at the water’s surface. Sharks are also thought to be colour blind, or to have only limited ability to perceive colours at best.

“Their acuity, or their ability to see detail, is much lower than ours,” the study’s lead author, Dr Laura Ryan said. “They’re not these mindless killers, but we just happen to look like their food.""

Ryan said more research was needed into other species involved in shark bites, such as bull shark and tiger sharks. “We’re not sure if mistaken identity applies to them. Seals aren’t a common prey item for them but they do consume things like turtles … and things floating at the surface.”

"The 2021 Nobel peace price has been awarded to two journalists and free speech activists: Maria Ressa from the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov from Russia.

Maria Ressa is a Filipino-American journalist and author, the co-founder and CEO of Rappler who spent nearly two decades as an investigative reporter in southeast Asia for CNN .

In 2020, she was convicted of cyberlibel under a controversial Philippine law against cybercrime, a move widely condemned by rights groups and journalists as an attack on press freedom.

The Guardian published this editorial about Ressa last year, calling her a “courageous journalist” and her conviction a move “designed to chill the media”.

Dmitry Muratov is a Russian journalist and one of the founders of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, described by the Committee to Protect Journalists as “the only truly critical newspaper with national influence in Russia today”.

Muratov won an International Press Freedom Award in 2007 for his courage in defending press freedom in the face of attacks, threats and imprisonment.

Announcing the award, the Nobel committee chair, Berit Reiss-Andersen, said: ""Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda. Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time.""

"Prof Sarah Gilbert has had quite a year.

The co-creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has been made a dame, been given an emotional standing ovation at Wimbledon – and now a 'vaccinologist barbie' doll has been made in her honour.

Gilbert, who led the development of the Covid vaccine at Oxford University, said she initially found the gesture “very strange” but hoped it would inspire young girls to work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem).

“I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of girls into Stem careers,” she said. “My wish is that my doll will show children careers they may not be aware of, like a vaccinologist.”

As well as the likeness of Dame Sarah, the toy company has created models in honour of five other inspirational women working in Stem around the world.

They include US healthcare workers Amy O’Sullivan and Dr Audrey Cruz, Canadian doctor and campaigner Dr Chika Stacy Oriuwa, Brazilian biomedical researcher Dr Jaqueline Goes de Jesus and Dr Kirby White, an Australian medic who co-created a reusable gown for frontline staff.

Would you buy a doll like this for a child in your family?

"“This is the day that we celebrate being women, our impact and contribution to each and every society that we are in and or attached to,” says photographer Esther Sweeney. Her portrait of Kenyan self-love and health advocate Ngina is featured on the cover of this gallery.

We spoke to Sweeney and other @blackwomenphotographers collective members about why they celebrate International Women’s Day, and who they’ll be celebrating.

The collective, established in 2020 via a Covid-19 relief fund, is approaching its second year of promoting and empowering Black female photographers across the world.

“For me, the day becomes a plea and a reminder for us to think more about what it means to be a woman in our various societies,” says photographer Immaculata Abba.

International Women’s Day, occurring every year on 8 March, aims to celebrate women's achievements, raise awareness against gender bias and take action for equality.

"""Obviously, I'm representing both my countries Nigeria and Greece. A lot of kids from there. Not just Nigeria, from whole Africa and whole Europe. I know I am a role model. But like this should make every person, every kid, anybody around the world to believe in their dreams.""

Giannis Antetokounmpo ended one of the greatest NBA finals ever with 50 points and a championship Milwaukee waited 50 years to win again.

Antetokounmpo added 14 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns 105-98 to win the series 4-2. It was the third game in this series with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds for Antetokounmpo, a dominant debut finals performance that takes its place among some of the game’s greatest.

He shot 16 for 25 from the field and made an unbelievable 17-of-19 free throws – a spectacular showing for any shooter, let alone one who was hitting just 55.6% in the post-season and was ridiculed for it at times.

""People told me I can’t make free throws and I made them tonight. And I’m a freaking champion,"" Antetokounmpo said.

Antetokounmpo was the star of these finals in every way, from his powerful play on the court to his humble thoughts in interviews to taking time after Tuesday night’s win to find children to high-five amid the celebrations. And he did it all after missing the final two games of the Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended left knee, an injury that at first he feared could be serious to end his season.

"Tributes have poured in for the comedian Sean Lock, who has died of cancer at the age of 58.

Celebrated for his carefully crafted surreal content and imaginative observational wit, Lock was nominated for the Perrier comedy award at the Edinburgh fringe in 2000 for his show No Flatley, I am the Lord of the Dance.

He achieved television success with a long run as a team captain on Jimmy Carr’s Channel 4 comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats and the spin-off, 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, and also wrote and starred in the popular BBC sitcom 15 Storeys High. The often deadpan absurdist, whose timing was described by one writer as “second only to the Greenwich Meridian”, toured extensively around the UK.

Bill Bailey told the Guardian that Lock was as “brilliantly funny” off the stage as on, and that their daft conversations would leave him “helpless with laughter”.

His agent, Off the Kerb Productions, said Lock died at home surrounded by his family: “Sean was one of Britain’s finest comedians, his boundless creativity, lightning wit and the absurdist brilliance of his work marked him out as a unique voice in British comedy. Sean was also a cherished husband and father to three children. Sean will be sorely missed by all that knew him.”

Lee Mack, a comedian and close friend, also paid tribute to Lock: “I think the appeal of him as a viewer was that it felt like you were with your mate down the pub and he was making you laugh. I was one of the lucky few that was that mate down the pub and he was making me laugh. A lot. More than almost anyone I’ve ever known.”",2021-08-18 18:02:16,"Tributes have poured in for the comedian Sean Lock who has died of cancer at the age of 58

"‘Dignified, strong, beautiful’

From images of war and powerful tributes - to reclining, topless men and 'Gays against Boris' - here are the best images from this year's coveted Taylor Wessing photographic portrait prize.

This year winner was Sydney photographer David Prichard for his series, Tribute to Indigenous Stock Women, capturing those who have spent most of their working lives on cattle stations in Queensland. The second image in this gallery shows Kurtijar woman Merna Beasley being honoured in the work.

""Any level of investigation into Australian history reveals the years of trauma that Indigenous people have suffered,"" Prichard says. ""One can only imagine what stock women endured, living in remote areas, in a world dominated by white colonial culture and law. I wanted to produce portraits that were dignified, strong and beautiful, and worthy to represent these women today and into the future.""

The Taylor Wessing contest is considered one of the most prestigious photography awards in the world, where the very best contemporary portrait photography is celebrated. Swipe to see more.

"The super bloom is back – but not everyone is super excited by it. 

After a string of dry years, people are once again descending on orange-saturated valleys across California and Arizona for a glimpse of the wild poppies.

The flowers are having a strong showing this year following a historically wet winter in the southwest US. In some regions you can even see the bright blankets of flowers from space.

The spectacle set off a frenzy four years ago when heavy winter rains coated huge swaths of land in the wildflowers, leading to a crush of tourists, influencers, selfies and environmental complaints.

“The flowers were beautiful; the scene was a nightmare,” said Lake Elsinore’s mayor, Natasha Johnson, in a February press conference, where she announced the closure of the canyon where the poppies were starting to grow.

This year there are calls for a greater awareness around the impact of such tourism.

“I don’t think it has to be this way, where we have to cordon off nature from humans. We can have a more positive relationship,” says Dr Naomi Fraga, the director of conservation at the California Botanic Garden. 

“This is a natural ecosystem,"" she adds. ""It is not just for pulling likes and clicks and endorphins. If an educational voice can be a louder voice than the influencers, that could do a lot of good.”",2023-04-16 18:13:45,"The super bloom is back  but not everyone is super excited by it

"The two athletes who agreed to share gold medals in the men’s high jump at the Olympics have been talking about their friendship.

Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy and Mutaz Barshim of Qatar were locked in first place after a tough few hours of competing so were given the the option to settle matters with a jump-off.

Barshim had a better idea: how about two golds?

The official agreed and the pair of them began to celebrate. Tamberi slapped Barshim’s hand and jumped into his arms before belly-flopping hard on to the track, rolling around a few times and screaming in joy.

“I still can’t believe it happened,” said Tamberi. “Sharing with a friend is even more beautiful. It was just magical.”

""He’s one of my best friends – not only on the track but outside of the track,"" added Barsham. “We’re always together almost. True spirit, sportsmen spirit, coming here and delivering this message. Appreciate what he’s done, he appreciates what I’ve done. This is amazing.""

"Saudi authorities have carried out their biggest crackdown on camel beauty contestants, disqualifying more than 40 “enhanced” camels from the annual pageant, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.

The camels disqualified in the competition, at the King Abdulaziz camel festival, were judged to have received Botox injections and other artificial touch-ups.

The festival, which started this month, invites the breeders of the most beautiful camels to compete for about $66m in prize money.

Botox injections, facelifts and other cosmetic alterations to make the camels more attractive are strictly prohibited. Jurors decide the winner based on the shape of the animals’ heads, necks, humps, dress, and postures.

Judges at the month-long festival, held in the desert north-east of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, are escalating their clampdown on artificially enhanced camels, the official news agency reported, using “specialised and advanced” technology to detect tampering.

This year, the authorities discovered dozens of breeders had stretched out the lips and noses of camels, used hormones to boost the animals’ muscles, injected heads and lips with Botox to make them bigger, inflated body parts with rubber bands, and used fillers to relax their faces.

“The club is keen to halt all acts of tampering and deception in the beautification of camels,” the SPA report said, adding organisers would “impose strict penalties on manipulators”.

The camel beauty contest is at the heart of the massive carnival, which also features camel races, sales and other festivities typically showcasing thousands of dromedaries.

Camel breeding is a multimillion-dollar industry - and events like this seek to preserve the camel’s role in the Bedouin tradition and heritage as the oil-rich country ploughs ahead with modernising mega projects.

"How would you describe these celebrations? 🇦🇷 🏆

Ecstatic Argentina fans have been flooding the streets of Buenos Aires after Lionel Messi’s sublime brilliance in Qatar elevated their team to a World Cup win over France on penalties.

Videos across the capital show supporters chanting and hugging one other during a carnivalesque cacophony of cheers, car horns, cumbia music and bullhorns.

“This is the greatest thing that could happen, like paradise,” said Juan Pablo Iglesias, 48. In his arms was his eight-year-old son, Manuel, tears of joy rolling down his face. “We’re champions,” the father said, turning to his child. “We’re the greatest in the world!”

"‘We are in a moment of generational change.’

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 became the youngest woman and youngest Latina to serve in the House of Representatives, is now 33, twice re-elected and comfortable in her political skin.

She could hardly be described as an old hand but nor does she channel the shock of the new.

She deploys social media with enviable authenticity; she grills congressional witnesses like a seasoned interrogator; she is an object of perverse fascination for Fox News and rightwing trolls; she has been around Washington long enough to draw charges of “co-option” and “selling out”.

Ocasio-Cortez, who recently sat down for an interview with the Guardian, is clearly aware of this eternal dilemma that can beset the left – purity versus pragmatism – and is determined to navigate it with care.

She makes clear that Biden cannot take progressives for granted next year, but urges Democrats to unite against the bigger threat facing America.

“We are not in 2020, and seeing what that turnout may look like is something that I’m sure keeps many of us up at night,” she says. “But that being said, I know that this is why, to me, support of President Biden has been very important, because this question is larger than any policy differences. This is truly about having a strong front against fascism in the United States.”

She also sees hope in how people have responded to the all-out attack on reproductive rights by Republicans and the supreme court. “Young women especially I think have been very animated and organised in this moment. I think we are in a moment of generational change.”

"Jacky Wright, the London-born corporate vice-president and chief digital officer at Microsoft US, was given this year’s top spot on 14 October by the Powerlist 2022, the annual list of the UK’s most powerful people of African, African-Caribbean and African American heritage.

Marcus Rashford, the footballer and campaigner, came in second place while Anne Mensah, vice-president of Content UK at Netflix, was third. The Oscar-winning actor Daniel Kaluuya is a new entrant to the list, in fourth.

Steven Bartlett, 29, founder and former CEO of Social Chain and the newly named youngest ever panellist on the BBC show Dragons’ Den, is another new entrant.

Wright welcomed the accolade but said the UK had a long way to go before it could call itself an equal society. “I am proud to be in the company of these great leaders of African and African-Caribbean heritage, but I am reminded that we still have a very long way to go,” she said.

“Each of us has a responsibility to ensure that we not only showcase role models, so future generations can envision who and what they can be but, more importantly, we need to make monumental shifts to create a more equitable society.”

Wright was selected by a panel of judges led by the retired high court judge Dame Linda Dobbs, who said Wright took the top spot for the “sheer scale of the work she is doing”.

As one of the most senior black leaders in the civil service, and HMRC’s disability champion, Wright campaigned for diversity in government, including race and disability.

The Powerlist was launched in 2007 to showcase black role models across industries including business, science, technology and the arts. Entrants are judged on their “ability to change lives and alter events, as demonstrated over a protracted period of time and in a positive manner”.

"What do you think of this kissing device?

A Chinese start-up has invented a long-distance kissing machine that transmits users’ kiss data collected through motion sensors hidden in silicon lips, which simultaneously move when replaying kisses received.

MUA – named after the sound people commonly make when blowing a kiss – also captures and replays sound and warms up slightly during kissing, making the experience more authentic, said Beijing-based Siweifushe.

Users can even download kissing data submitted via an accompanying app by other users. The invention was inspired by lockdown isolation. At their most severe, China’s lockdowns saw authorities forbid residents to leave their apartments for months on end.

“I was in a relationship back then, but I couldn’t meet my girlfriend due to lockdowns,” said inventor Zhao Jianbo.

Then a student at the Beijing Film Academy, he focused his graduate project on the lack of physical intimacy in video calls. He later set up Siweifushe which released MUA, its first product, on 22 January. The device is priced at 260 yuan ($38).

In the two weeks after its release, the firm sold over 3,000 kissing machines and received about 20,000 orders, he said.

The MUA resembles a mobile stand with colourless pursed lips protruding from the front. To use it, lovers must download an app on to their smartphones and pair their kissing machines. When they kiss the device, it kisses back.

It has received mixed reviews, with some users saying it was intriguing while others said it made them feel uncomfortable. Among the top complaints was its lack of tongue.

Some commentators on social media site Weibo also expressed concern that the device could be used for online erotic content, which is strictly regulated in China.

Zhao said his company complies with regulations, but that “there’s little we can do as for how people use the device.”

"""Everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes.""

DC Comics has confirmed that the new iteration of Superman, Jonathan Kent, is bisexual.

In the new comic, the traditionally heterosexual superhero will embark on a same-sex relationship with a friend, Jay Nakamura, a reporter who cares for him after he “mentally and physically burns out from trying to save everyone that he can”.

Kent, who is the son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, started his tenure in July.

“The idea of replacing Clark Kent with another straight white savior felt like a missed opportunity,” Tom Taylor, the series writer, said in an interview with the New York Times.

“I’ve always said everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes and I’m very grateful DC and Warner Bros share this idea"".

The news follows other recent attempts to add queerness to the world of comics. In August, it was announced that the latest version of Robin would have a boyfriend - while in March, Marvel also made the decision to pass the mantle of Captain America to a gay character.

Kent’s sexuality is not the only way in which Superman has been updated for a new audience and time.

Recent issues have seen the character protesting against the deportation of refugees, stopping a high school shooting and trying to put out wildfires that were the cause of the climate crisis.

Attention now turns to the big-screen worlds of Marvel and DC which remains less progressive than the comics.

This November’s Eternals is set to change things with the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first LGBTQ+ kiss between Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos, the first openly gay superhero in a Marvel movie, and Haaz Sleiman, who plays his husband.

"'I am grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many.'

New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard is set to make history and headlines, plus attract a considerable amount of controversy, after being confirmed as the first transgender athlete to ever compete at the Olympic Games.

The 43-year-old will be a possible medal contender when she competes in the women’s super heavyweight category on 2 August.

But Hubbard’s inclusion will also frustrate those who believe she has an unfair advantage over her rivals, having gone through male puberty before transitioning in 2012, which may offer advantages in power and strength to athletes even after taking medication to suppress their testosterone levels.

The New Zealand Olympic Committee chief executive, Kereyn Smith, said Hubbard would be welcomed to the New Zealand team.

“As well as being among the world’s best for her event, Laurel has met the IWF eligibility criteria including those based on IOC guidelines for transgender athletes,” she said. “We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play.

“As the New Zealand team, we have a strong culture of ‘manaaki’ [respect] and inclusion and respect for all.""

"A small bakery in Texas which lost orders and Facebook followers after posting a message in support of the LGBTQ community sold out its inventory two days in a row over the weekend, after a surge of support from around the world.

Confections, in Lufkin, east Texas, said it had suffered a backlash after posting a photo at the start of June of a rainbow-decorated cookie in the shape of a heart, accompanied by the message: “More LOVE. Less hate. Happy Pride to all our LGBTQ friends!""

The message, marking Pride month, was followed up by a more solemn post the next day. “Today has been hard. Really hard,” Confections wrote. “We lost a significant amount of followers because of a rainbow heart cookie we posted.""

The bakery added that it now had “an over abundance” of cookies available for sale, but could hardly have expected what happened next. The post attracted more than 12,000 likes, from people around the world, with people local to east Texas promising to visit the bakery.

Many followed through on their promises, and a photo posted by Confections showed a line of customers stretching down the street outside the business. On Saturday, Confections returned to Facebook to share the good news.

The bakery also said after it sold out of its baked goods, some customers had lingered and donated money, which it said would go towards local animal rescues.

"“A lifetime of selfless service""

The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to the Queen – and environmental activists across the world – in speeches at a concert at Buckingham Palace.

Speaking on the third day of a four-day celebration to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee at the BBC’s Platinum Party at the Palace, Prince Charles began his address “Your Majesty, Mummy”.

Thanking the Queen for a “lifetime of selfless service”, he told her during the televised concert: “You continue to make history.""

Referencing her absence from the celebrations, after she was said to have experienced “some discomfort” during trooping the colour on Thursday, he said: “We might have been celebrating that Derby winner this evening … next year perhaps?”

“But,” he added addressing the audience, “I know what really gets my mother up in the morning is all of you – watching at home. Represented here tonight in this great audience.”

The late Prince Philip, the Queen’s “strength and stay”, he said was “much missed this evening but I am sure he is here in spirit … My Papa would have enjoyed the show and joined us wholeheartedly in celebrating all you continue to do for your country and your people.”

“You have met us and talked with us. You laugh and cry with us and, most importantly, you have been there for us, for these 70 years. You pledged to serve your whole life – you continue to deliver. That is why we are here.”

He spoke to a background of projections, understood to have been selected by Charles himself, of the Queen from historic moments – including Nelson Mandela’s state visit in 1996 and shaking hands with Martin McGuinness, the former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland in 2012.

Earlier in the night, Prince William called for urgent action to save the planet. Watch the highlights from his speech via the link in bio.

"The pop singer and TV personality Sarah Harding, who had 21 UK Top 10 singles as a member of Girls Aloud, has died aged 39 from breast cancer.

In a post on Instagram, Harding’s mother Marie said: “It’s with deep heartbreak that today I’m sharing the news that my beautiful daughter Sarah has sadly passed away.

“Many of you will know of Sarah’s battle with cancer and that she fought so strongly from her diagnosis until her last day. She slipped away peacefully this morning.

“I’d like to thank everyone for their kind support over the past year. It meant the world to Sarah and it gave her great strength and comfort to know she was loved.

“I know she won’t want to be remembered for her fight against this terrible disease – she was a bright shining star and I hope that’s how she can be remembered instead. – Marie x”.

In August 2020, Harding announced that she had been diagnosed with the disease and was receiving chemotherapy. “My amazing mum, family and close friends are helping me through this, and I want to say a thank you to the wonderful NHS doctors and nurses who have been and continue to be heroes,” she said at the time.

Harding was born in 1981 in Berkshire and raised in Stockport. She left school early and began focusing on a music career, initially recording vocals for dance producers. In 2002, she unsuccessfully auditioned for BBC talent show Fame Academy, but successfully entered ITV’s Popstars: The Rivals that year.

The format created a boy band, One True Voice, and a girl band, Girls Aloud, who were then pitted against each other for that year’s Christmas No 1. Girls Aloud, with Harding alongside Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Tweedy and Kimberley Walsh – “five northern girls with attitude, very outspoken,” as Harding described them – were triumphant, with their debut single Sound of the Underground becoming the first of four UK chart-toppers and 21 Top 10 hits in a decade-long career.

In 2021, she published a memoir, Hear Me Out, written in the wake of her diagnosis. She said she was “inundated with lovely messages from my fans,” after announcing her illness. “I’m grateful beyond words for that,” she added.",2021-09-05 17:01:43,"The pop singer and TV personality Sarah Harding who had 21 UK Top 10 singles as a member of Girls Aloud has died aged 39 from breast cancer

"“Please let me hug my family before it’s too late!”

That's the title of a petition that has been signed by over 240,000 people demanding a new law ending isolation for care home residents, with many saying care operators are still refusing to follow government advice and are imposing their own stricter regimes.

100-year-old care home resident Frances Heaton has issued a video plea for greater freedom, complaining that thousands of people can go to pop festivals but she is being prevented from seeing two of her children at her home in Yorkshire.

Government guidance is that every care home resident in England can have an unlimited number of “named visitors” who will be able to enter the care home for regular visits after negative tests and they can also nominate one essential care giver who undergoes regular testing who may visit the home to attend to essential care needs.

Hundreds of families are to protest in Westminster next week over restrictions on residents’ access to their families in care homes and the lack of legal visiting rights after 18 months of lockdowns. The protest, organised by the Rights for Residents campaign group, will be led by the actor Ruthie Henshall, whose mother, Gloria, died recently after isolation in a care home that allowed only “window visits”.

“My name is Frances,” Heaton said in the message from her room. “I was 100 years old in March. After 18 months of being shut out from the outsider world my daughter can now see me in my room. But my other daughter and my son are not allowed in my room. But 90,000 people can visit the Leeds Festival. Human rights and equality are out of order altogether.”

Jenny Morrison, the co-founder of Rights for Residents, said: “Some people are paying £8,000 a month [in care fees] and haven’t got the right to decide who comes into their home. We feel that if social care is going to be reformed, they should look at the rights of people in care homes and the responsibilities of people that look after them.”

"Folajimi Olubunmi-Adewole - known as Jimi - was described as 'the best of us' and 'a true hero of our city' by London mayor Sadiq Khan.

The 20-year-old tragically died after jumping into the River Thames to rescue a woman who fell from London Bridge on Saturday.

His father, Michael Adewola, 63, told the Sun newspaper that his son deserved a medal for the bravery he showed.

“He is a very unique and angelic soul, and I am proud of him, so proud, and I want the world to know he is the deepest and most wonderful man,” Adewola said. “He is a hero, and always will be, I can’t bring him back but I want him to be remembered forever for what he did, it was just like him to want to always try and help others.”

The GoFundMe page was set up by Malcolm’s World Foundation, a charity set up in memory of Malcolm Mide-Madariola, who was murdered in 2018. Olubunmi-Adewole went to school with him and had his name tattooed on his arm.

“This family just lost another hero,” the charity tweeted. “Such a pure hearted soul. Extremely loving and caring.""

"Chloé Zhao has become the second woman in the history of the Oscars - and the first Asian woman - to be named best director at the Academy Awards.

Zhao, 39, consolidated her domination of the category this awards season, by being named best director for Nomadland, her acclaimed road movie starring Frances McDormand.

In China, Zhao’s country of birth, posts about her victory were removed and Weibo searches for her Chinese name returned results about a low-level official who had volunteered to promote a local Covid-19 vaccination drive.

Last night's ceremony was not broadcast in China, but many people saw 39-year-old Zhao’s acceptance speech via clips shared on social media, adding comments of congratulations.

“She is the pride of Chinese and even all Asian people,” said one commenter on Weibo.

Zhao, who was born in China and lived in Beijing until she was 14, accepted her award saying she had been “thinking a lot lately about how I keep going when things get hard”. 

She recalled playing a game with her father, memorising classic Chinese poems. She recited a line from the three character classic, “人之初，性本善”, and translated it to English: “people at birth are inherently good”.",2021-04-26 10:27:16,"Chlo Zhao has become the second woman in the history of the Oscars  and the first Asian woman  to be named best director at the Academy Awards

"Nancy Vanderstraeten is not your average boxer. Not only is she 75 years old, but she also has Parkinson's disease. 

Vanderstraeten thinks that boxing is keeping her fit and helping with the effects of the disease. ""Since I started boxing, everyday tasks have become easier for me,"" she says. 

""If you have Parkinson's, there are only two paths ahead of you: either you do not exercise and become paralysed, or be active and live a better life. I feel great while boxing. The punches I throw heal me. I listen to very loud music when I box. My brain works more efficiently as well. I feel great after every training session.""⁣

"How many toys names do you think your pet can remember?

Our dogs might follow commands such as “sit”, or become uncontrollably excited at the mention of the word “walkies”, but when it comes to recalling the names of their toys and other everyday items, most seem pretty absent-minded.

Now a study of six “genius dogs” has advanced our understanding of dogs’ memories, suggesting some of them possess a remarkable grasp of the human language.

Hungarian researchers spent more than two years scouring the globe for dogs who could recognise the names of their various toys.

Although most can learn commands to some degree, learning the names of items appears to be a very different task, with most dogs unable to master this skill.

Max (Hungary), Gaia (Brazil), Nalani (Netherlands), Squall (US), Whisky (Norway), and Rico (Spain) made the cut after proving they knew the names of more than 28 toys, with some knowing more than 100.

They were then enlisted to take part in a series of livestreamed experiments known as the Genius Dog Challenge.

All of the dogs taking part were border collies – herding dogs originally bred to work sheep. Although this makes many of them very responsive to the behaviour of their owners, only a small proportion of the breed are able to memorise the names of their toys.

Neither is this talent unique to border collies. “Thanks to the Genius Dog Challenge we have managed until now to find also dogs from other breeds including a German shepherd, a pekingese, a mini Australian shepherd and a few dogs of mixed breeds,” said researcher Dr Shany Dror from the Eötvös Loránd University. Separate research has also suggested some Yorkshire terriers may be able to do it.

“Dogs are good models for studying human behaviour as they evolved and develop in the human environment,” said one of the study’s co-authors, Prof Ádám Miklósi at Eötvös Loránd University. “With these talented dogs we have a unique opportunity to study how another species understands the human language, and how learning words influences the way we think about the world.”

"""If you find yourself holding a Maya Angelou quarter, may you be reminded of her words, ‘be certain that you do not die without having done something wonderful for humanity.’”

The late poet and activist, Maya Angelou has become the first Black woman ever to appear on a US quarter, after a coin featuring her image went into circulation on Monday.

With her arms uplifted, a bird in flight and a rising sun behind her, the US Mint said the image (pictured on the second slide) was “inspired by her poetry and symbolic of the way she lived”. A portrait of George Washington appears on the “heads” side. 

The poet and writer, who died in 2014, was the author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, in which she wrote about the racial discrimination she experienced growing up. 

The author of 36 books – and the recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees – she read her poem On the Pulse of the Morning at Bill Clinton’s 1992 inauguration, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010.

The Angelou quarter is the first in the US Mint’s American Women Quarters programme, which will include the physicist and first female astronaut Dr Sally Ride and Wilma Mankiller, the first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, later this year. The American public was invited to submit names of iconic women for the programme after a bill put forward by Democrat congresswoman Barbara Lee.

“I am proud to have led this effort to honour these phenomenal women, who more often than not are overlooked in our country’s telling of history,"" said Lee.

""If you find yourself holding a Maya Angelou quarter, may you be reminded of her words, ‘be certain that you do not die without having done something wonderful for humanity.’”

"Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel peace prize laureate and veteran of South Africa's struggle against white minority rule, has died aged 90.

Tutu, described by foreign observers and his countrymen as the moral conscience of his nation, passed away in Cape Town on Boxing Day.

“The passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” president Cyril Ramaphosa said.

Tutu was born in October 1931 and ordained an Anglican priest in 1961. He was thrust into the limelight in 1978, when he was appointed secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches.

Excitable, emotional, charismatic and highly articulate, Tutu won the Nobel peace prize in 1984. A vocal supporter of sanctions against South Africa, he was detested by supporters of the apartheid regime, who saw him as an agitator and traitor.

Tutu was however protected not just by his wit and combative spirit but by his immense popularity and respect. In 1986 he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town, the effective head of the Anglican church in his homeland.

After the nation’s first free election in 1994, Nelson Mandela, who had become the president of a free South Africa, asked Tutu to chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the controversial and emotional hearings into apartheid-era human rights abuses.

""Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless,"" is how Mandela, who died in December 2013, described his friend.

Tutu, who retired from most public duties in October 2010, is still seen as a voice of integrity. ""The Arch"", as he is affectionately known, will be remembered as one of the leading lights of the struggle against apartheid who was not afraid to condemn injustice wherever he saw it.

"It's not rocket science ... or is it?

Researchers have found aerospace engineers and brain surgeons are not necessarily brighter than the general population.

After examining data from an international cohort of 329 aerospace engineers and 72 neurosurgeons - and comparing results against those previously gathered from more than 18,000 members of the British public, here is what they learned:

Researchers asked the aerospace engineers and neurosurgeons to complete 12 tasks online using the Great British Intelligence Test (GBIT) - and to answer some supporting questions. The tasks examined various aspects of cognition, including planning and reasoning, working memory, attention, and emotion processing abilities.

The findings reveal that only neurosurgeons showed a significant difference with quicker problem-solving speed but slower memory recall compared with the general population, which researchers noted ""might arise from the fast-paced nature of neurosurgery, which attracts those with a pre-existing flair for rapid processing ...""

They said the study was, in part, carried out to lay to rest the question of whether one of the professions had the intellectual upper hand – a tension made famous by the Mitchell and Webb sketch in which a swaggering neurosurgeon is slapped down by an aerospace expert who says: “Brain surgery … it’s not exactly rocket science is it?”

However, the team found few differences between the cognitive abilities of aerospace engineers and neuroscientists, although the results suggest the former had higher scores for attention and mental manipulation – such as rotating objects in one’s head – while neurosurgeons showed higher scores in semantic problem solving – such as definitions of rare words.

“Essentially what we think it shows is that everyone has a range of skills ... and it is very difficult to be better in everything across the board,” said Aswin Chari, a neurosurgical trainee at Great Ormond Street hospital and an author of the study.

Referencing the two professions, Chari added: “It is not that they are better at everything, but they are better at certain things that make them good at what they do.”

"Charlie Watts, the Rolling Stones drummer who propelled the band’s sound for nearly 60 years, has died aged 80.

A statement from his London publicist, Bernard Doherty, to the PA news agency said: “It is with immense sadness that we announce the death of our beloved Charlie Watts.

“He passed away peacefully in a London hospital earlier today surrounded by his family. Charlie was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and also, as a member of the Rolling Stones, one of the greatest drummers of his generation.”

Earlier this month, it was announced that Watts was to miss the band’s forthcoming US tour as he recovered from an unspecified medical procedure.

With his limber stance, keen knowledge of jazz, and unruffled ability to make songs swing even when keeping the strictest time, Watts is regarded as one of the greatest – and most stylish – rock drummers of all time.

Among those paying tribute was Ringo Starr, his opposite number in friendly rivals the Beatles, who wrote: “God bless Charlie Watts we’re going to miss you man peace and love to the family”. Paul McCartney also paid tribute. “He was a lovely guy. I knew he was ill but I didn’t know he was this ill,"" he said. ""Charlie was a rock, and a fantastic drummer … Love you Charlie, I’ve always loved you – a beautiful man.”

Meanwhile, Elton John wrote: “A very sad day. Charlie Watts was the ultimate drummer. The most stylish of men, and such brilliant company.”

"Tom Dean won gold in the pool for Team GB at the Olympics – and his family and friends enjoyed the moment with a garden party in the middle of the night in the UK.

Six months ago Dean wasn’t sure whether he would even make it to these Olympics. Covid has affected every athlete’s preparations for the Games, but it hit Dean’s more than most. He caught it once, last September, then again in the new year, which he thinks made him the first British Olympian to have it twice.

The second time was the worst, too. He was ill for 10 days, then stuck indoors in isolation, and was unable to train for the best part of a month after that. Altogether it cost him seven weeks of winter training. In those moments alone, languishing in his flat, Tokyo seemed a lot further than a 12-hour flight away.

""It seemed a million miles off,"" Dean said. And now here he is, Great Britain’s first Olympic champion in the men’s 200m freestyle since 1908. He won in a new national record of 1min 44.22sec. His friend and teammate, Duncan Scott, was a fingertip behind him, winning silver to give Great Britain their first one-two in the pool in 113 years.

"""It is such an honour""

The gold medal-winning rower Mohamed Sbihi will make history tomorrow as the first Muslim to carry the British flag at an Olympic opening ceremony.

He will be joined by another gold medallist, the sailor Hannah Mills, a campaigner for clean oceans and the eradication of single use plastic in sport.

It is the first time that two competitors will be able to carry the flag after the IOC announced last year that each national Olympic committee could nominate one female and one male athlete as flag bearers.

“It is such an honour,” Sbihi, who won a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in the men’s four, said. “It is an iconic moment within the Olympic movement – people remember those images.

He added: “I’ve won a medal, been to the closing ceremony but now to actually turn up at an opening ceremony and be at the head of the team alongside Hannah will be a lifetime memory that I will never forget.”

Mills, who will be defending her women’s 470 title alongside Eilidh McIntyre in Tokyo, said being chosen was ""the greatest honour in my career and I hope more than ever before that this Games can lift our country and deliver some incredible sporting moments to inspire the nation.”

Sbihi and Mills follow in the footsteps of some of Team GB’s most legendary athletes including Sir Andy Murray, rowers Sir Matthew Pinsent and Sir Steve Redgrave, and also Anita Lonsborough, the first woman to carry the flag for Team GB in Tokyo in 1964.

"Wanted: someone with experience running a pub, a love of isolation and a willingness to mark their appointment by sitting on a throne and having beer poured over their head.

A council has begun one of the UK’s most unusual local government recruitment processes while looking for someone to run the Ship Inn on Piel Island, off the coast near Barrow-in-Furness in the North-west of England.

Whoever is in charge of the pub is crowned “King of Piel” in a ceremony involving a rusty sabre which concludes with buckets of beer being poured over their head. Any punter who unwittingly sits on the throne has to buy drinks for everyone.

Barrow borough council is seeking to a recruit a landlord, on a 10-year lease, in time for the season starting in April. As well as running the pub the successful applicant will need to manage and maintain the island itself.

Many people go to the island for birthday parties or for a few drinks before camping overnight.

John Murphy has been leading walks to the island for nearly 40 years and says whoever gets the job will need to be “massively dedicated”.

“You can’t just nip across to Tesco for a loaf of bread when you’re on Piel Island,” he said. “You’ll need to have dedication and a strong passion for isolation and peace and quiet. It takes a special personality.”

Murphy would love the job himself but, at 73, says he is too old. He has handed the job of leading walks to the island to younger legs, but he still intends to be on Piel telling its stories.

“I absolutely adore Piel Island, I adore its isolation. I also love the fact that Barrow still is an industrial town and yet we have this gorgeous, isolated island within spitting distance.”

What do you think? Will you be applying?

"""Now we can bring them home and say goodbye with love.""
 
Police in the Brazilian Amazon have found the bodies of two men in the area close to where British journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira went missing 10 days ago.
 
The announcement brought a sad end to a long search which has horrified the nation and underlined the growing dangers faced by those who dare to defend Brazil’s environment and Indigenous communities, whose rights have been increasingly under attack under the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.
 
Phillips and Pereira set off into the forest on 2 June for what was supposed to be a short trip. But by Sunday 5 June, they had not returned.
 
It was supposed to be one of Phillips’s last trips to the Amazon, the kicker for a book that would reveal all the lush complexity of the world’s largest rainforest. Instead, it seems to have been a final chapter for Phillips, who was a frequent contributor to the Guardian, and his friend Pereira, a guide and expert on Indigenous people.
 
Phillips, a 57-year-old journalist from Merseyside in the UK, and Pereira, a 41-year-old father of two from Brazil’s north-east, bonded over a shared love of the Amazon.
 
For almost two years they travelled together, with Pereira accompanying Phillips on his reporting trips. Phillips was writing a book about sustainable development in the rainforest and the younger man was an eager companion.
 
Pereira believed in the project and opened doors to the jungle and its people.
 
In a statement, Phillips’s wife, Alessandra Sampaio, said: “Although we are still awaiting definitive confirmations, this tragic outcome puts an end to the anguish of not knowing Dom and Bruno’s whereabouts. Now we can bring them home and say goodbye with love ... Today, we also begin our quest for justice.”

"Could you tell? 

A photographer is refusing a prestigious award after admitting to being a “cheeky monkey” and generating the prize-winning image using artificial intelligence.

The German artist Boris Eldagsen revealed on his website that he was not accepting the prize for the creative open category, which he won at last week’s Sony world photography awards.

The winning photograph depicted two women from different generations in black and white.

In a statement on his website, @boriseldagsen said he “applied as a cheeky monkey” to find out if competitions would be prepared for AI images to enter. “They are not,” he added.

“We, the photo world, need an open discussion,” said Eldagsen. “A discussion about what we want to consider photography and what not. Is the umbrella of photography large enough to invite AI images to enter – or would this be a mistake?

“With my refusal of the award I hope to speed up this debate.”

He said this was a “historic moment” as it was the first time an AI image had won a prestigious international photography competition, adding: “How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated? Something about this doesn’t feel right, does it?

“AI images and photography should not compete with each other in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.”

Eldagsen suggested donating the prize to a photo festival hosted in Odesa, Ukraine.

"For some, it is a source of shame – and a trigger for frequent mirror checks: is my hairline receding? Is there a thin patch on top of my head?

But for the acclaimed photographer Rankin and the conceptual artists Scott Kelly and Ben Polkinghorne, male baldness is something to celebrate.

Their 'Baldpieces' project, a series of portraits of men adorned with striking headwear, focuses on masculine beauty and challenges an enduring taboo.

Two-thirds of men begin to lose hair on their heads by the age of 35. By the age of 50, 85% of men will have significantly thinner hair.

Kelly and Polkinhorne made hundreds of sketches of male pattern baldness before whittling them down to eight shapes. They then collaborated with headpiece designers to create magnificent “crowns to adorn balding crowns”.

With Rankin’s involvement, they put out casting calls for balding men to be photographed. “Because of the stigma, we were amazed there were men willing to come forward,” said Kelly.

Rankin, a globally renowned portrait and fashion photographer whose subjects have included the Queen, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones and Madonna, said the headpieces were “brilliant in their originality”.

“There is a taboo around baldness – we don’t particularly talk to other men about it, apart from taking the mickey,” he said. This project was “trying to create something new, and say it’s OK to be bald. It’s so confronting – yet so unashamedly masculine.”

"Speaking publicly for the first time after his rescue, an Australian sailor who was found adrift in the Pacific Ocean after three months has said he is grateful to be alive.

Timothy Lyndsay Shaddock, 54, set sail in April from the Mexican coastal city of La Paz bound for French Polynesia about 6,000 km away, but became stranded after a rough storm damaged his catamaran and knocked out the communications equipment.

He was accompanied by a dog, Bella, who “sort of found me in the middle of Mexico … I tried to find a home for her maybe three times and she just kept following me into the water,” Shaddock said.

“She’s a beautiful animal and I’m just grateful she’s alive.”

They survived the ordeal by eating raw fish and drinking rain water until they were found by a Mexican fishing ship.

Touching dry land for the first time on Tuesday in the Mexican port city of Manzanillo, after being examined onboard the boat that rescued him, Shaddock said: “The captain and this fishing company that saved my life, I’m just so grateful.”

"Women's rights activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai has married her partner, Asser Malik, in a small ceremony in Birmingham, England.

The world’s youngest winner of the Nobel peace prize confirmed the news on her Instagram account saying; “Today marks a precious day in my life. Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life.""

“We celebrated a small nikkah [Islamic marriage contract] ceremony at home in Birmingham with our families. Please send us your prayers. We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead.”

Although the pair have been private about their relationship, @malala and Asser are said to have known each other for at least three years. According to his Linkedin profile, Asser works in the sports industry and is currently employed by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

Now 24, Yousafzai won the Nobel peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17, alongside the Indian children’s rights activist Kailash Satyarthi, for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people.

Yousafzai began blogging for the BBC in 2009 about her experiences during the Taliban’s growing influence in the Swat Valley region of Pakistan. Attempting to silence her, the Taliban shot the then 15-year-old in the head in 2012. She survived, later writing in her book: “Instead of silencing me, they amplified my voice beyond Pakistan"".

She has continued to campaign for girls’ education while graduating from Oxford University last year with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, politics and economics (PPE).

"Which loo with a view is your number one? ... or number two?

Be it the crest of an icy mountain peak, the depths of the dense native bush, or the slopes of sleeping volcanoes, New Zealand’s wild and remote landscapes are coveted by outdoor enthusiasts the world over.

But what really sets the country’s nature apart from the rest is what is at one’s disposal when nature calls – spectacular loos with views.

These scenic spots – small, remote, and lacking in plumbing – are a curious quirk in New Zealand’s landscape, and offer up some of the best panoramas in the country.

The department of conservation is responsible for the extensive network of landscape latrines and holds the unusual gong of “managing more toilets than any other organisation in New Zealand”.

Many of the impressive long-drops are linked to some of the 970 huts dotted through the more remote and striking parts of the country, and require helicopters to fly the waste out.

The department says it is looking at ways of reducing helicopter flying to reduce cost and carbon emissions.

The oldest toilet is believed to be a 90-year-old pit toilet at an old farm homestead now managed by the department as part of Rakiura national park called “Island Hill Run” on Rakiura/Stewart Island.

The toilet with the most impressive altitude is at Empress Hut, 2,500m up New Zealand’s highest mountain, Aoraki/Mt Cook in the Southern Alps.

So if you're bogged down with your mediocre toilet views, head to New Zealand for the best seat in the house ... if you're ready to take the plunge.

Sorry, we'll stop now.

"“I cried tears of happiness because so many people have supported me for a long time,"" said gymnast Oksana Chusovitina after competing in her eighth consecutive Olympic Games this week.

The 46-year-old did not score highly enough to advance in Tokyo this year, but received a standing ovation in what she says will be her last Olympics.

Chusovitina has won 13 world and Olympic medals combined, including a record nine world championship medals on vault, with a silver at Beijing in 2008.

Now, at 46 with a son older than most of her competitors, she's ready to retire: “My son is 22 years old and I want to spend time with him. I want to be a mom and wife,” Chusovitina said.

She has essentially been one of the top eight vaulters in the world throughout most of her career, most recently finishing fourth at the world championships in 2018, aged 44.

Chusovitina’s career has spanned four national teams: the Soviet Union, the United Team in 1992 after the Soviet Union’s demise, her native Uzbekistan, Germany and then Uzbekistan again.

In the midst of her flourishing career, she moved to Germany in 2002 after her son Alisher was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and eventually represented them. Chusovitina kept training during this time because the prize money was a vital source of income. “If I don’t compete then my son won’t live, it’s as simple as that,” she said at the time.

"Presented with her Bafta lifetime achievement award – the TV industry’s ‘highest accolade’ – Meera Syal dedicated her win “to all my fellow travellers, all the ones who’ve been made to feel because of their race, sex or class that their stories don’t matter. They do because the untold stories are the ones that change us, and sometimes can change the world.”

Syal, who is best known for starring in Goodness Gracious Me and as one of the first British Asian people to regularly star on TV in the UK, added that the TV industry needs more diversity, “not just in front of the camera but in the writers’ rooms, in makeup vans and around tables where deals are done”.

Putting a glittering bindi on her face-shaped Bafta award last night, Syal, 61, recalled how growing up as a “chubby brown kid from Wolverhampton I got othered a lot”, and how her father had studied philosophy and dreamed of being a singer and a poet, yet encountered the attitude: “Never mind bloody Plato, can you drive a bus or not?” on his arrival in the UK.

Bafta chair Krish Majumdar described Syal as a “national treasure”, whose role in Goodness Gracious Me – shown on BBC Two from 1998 to 2001 – had “changed the game”.

“You have paved the way for so many others – seeing is believing. I wouldn’t be standing here if it wasn’t for you,” he said.

"Overstone Kondowe’s historic election as Malawi's first MP with albinism has been hailed as a “giant step forward in the protection of human rights of people with albinism in Malawi and Africa as whole”.

In the southern African country, and many other parts of the continent, people with the hereditary lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes face severe discrimination and physical attacks - meaning many children often do not go to school.

Both Malawi and neighbouring Tanzania have a long history of people with albinism being killed for their body parts, which fetch high prices, as they are used in rituals, witchcraft and are believed to bring good luck.

But Kondowe, who took his seat in the new parliament on Monday, hopes his election has set a precedent in a country where 134,636 people are living with albinism. ""The victory is a clear demonstration that people are changing their altitudes,” he said.

The 42-year-old son of a teacher, grew up in a village without any help to ease the pain in his sun-sensitive skin or glasses to aid his poor eyesight.

Despite struggling to see what was written on the blackboard, Kondowe worked his way through school and university to achieve high-level positions in both the government and in non-governmental organisations.

Kondowe, a former president of Malawi’s Association of People with Albinism (APAM), has said that although attacks for body parts had been reduced, thanks to a handful of high-profile prosecutions, there was still a long way to go - and that he plans to work for legislation to protect all people with disabilities.

Ikponwosa Ero, a former UN adviser on albinism, said she was “elated” by Kondowe’s election, which she called a “giant step forward"". Meanwhile, Charles Mailosi, 29, a teacher from Lilongwe who has albinism, said he was excited by Kondowe’s victory.

“This is a powerful sign that Malawians are accepting [us],” he said.

“It gives me courage that I can achieve greater things in life and that people can trust me.”

"The Cop26 climate talks may now feel like a distant memory now, but this is the time where the real work must happen. 

Native Alaskan climate activist @charitieropati has been highlighting the urgent need to centre Black and Indigenous voices when we have conversations about the climate breakdown.

""My great grandfather predicted that the ice was rotting, that's how he described it [to my mother] in Yup'ik,"" says Charitie.

The 20-year-old @columbia student spoke to us about her people, who rely on Alaska's ice and sea for food, and how an intimate relationship and respect for the land makes Indigenous knowledge so crucial in caring for the future of the planet.

""It's hard for settlers to hear this,"" she says, ""but one of the biggest things to combat climate change is giving sovereignty back to Indigenous peoples over their land. Giving land back.""

This is the last episode in our new mini-series, which we created to help platform underrepresented Indigenous voices at a time when their knowledge and traditions could mean the difference of creating a habitable planet.

"Joan Macdonald (@trainwithjoan) has not always looked like a bodybuilder. At 71, she weighed 90kg (14st 4lb), and had rising blood pressure and kidney troubles. She was also on medication for cholesterol and acid reflux, and her doctor wanted to double the dose.

Her daughter, Michelle, expressed Macdonald’s dilemma bluntly. 'You’re going to end up like your mother did in a nursing home!' she told Macdonald. 'And people are going to have to look after you. Do you want that?'

'Of course I didn’t want it,' Macdonald says now. 'I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.' Macdonald’s thoughts swirled for two weeks. She thought: 'I want to earn Michelle’s respect. I mean, she loves me, but you can love a person without even liking them.'

She left her home in Ontario, Canada, to join Michelle and her husband, both fitness coaches, in Tulum, Mexico. Macdonald learned to make protein shakes. She visited the gym. She followed Michelle’s workout program, using the machines, then light weights – 2.5lb – working up to heavier ones. She mimes raising a barbell and lowering it behind her head. She can do this with 25lb.

'Wow! Your back!' people in the gym told her. 'It’s so defined!' They took photos. 'I’m going: wooh! That looks pretty good! I’ve got some muscles here.' Within nine months, she was off all medication.

'There is a misconception that people over 65 cannot produce hypertrophy [growth] of the muscle,' says Mark Peterson, an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Michigan. 'Muscle is a tissue that can adapt with stimulus.' The key is to check with a doctor first, and start slowly.

On Instagram, Macdonald posts photos of herself in sports tops, or jumping waves in beachwear. She has 1.4m followers and a partnership with the retailer Women’s Best. 'I have a tendency to do things that anyone else would say: oh my God! What’s she doing now?'

Macdonald celebrated her 75th birthday this year by zip lining. In DIY projects, her husband is supervisor and Macdonald 'dogsbody'. But now, she says: 'I’m building me instead.'

"“I dedicate this story to every single survivor of sexual assault,” Michaela Coel said at the end of her speech accepting the Emmy award for best writing in a limited series.

Within her speech she spoke directly to writers, urging them to “write the tale that scares you, that makes you feel uncertain, that isn’t comfortable. I dare you.”

The award was for her breakout hit show I May Destroy You which is about a young writer named Arabella who’s drugged and raped, and embarks on a quest for justice and self-knowledge.

Coel is the first Black woman to win the award, but as a whole the Emmys showed a diversity problem still remains - handing almost all the acting awards to white performers.

The awards had a diverse line-up of presenters and nominees across the board. But the likes of Billy Porter and Mj Rodriguez from Pose, the late Michael K. Williams from Lovecraft Country, and Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang from Saturday Night Live, all went home empty-handed.

In an awards show designed to celebrate the very best, broad and brilliant spectrum of television has to offer, most of the prizes went to just two shows: The Crown and Ted Lasso.

"Thinking of giving friends secondhand presents this festive season?

If a secondhand ""vintage"" gift was once considered cheap, it’s now an inspired choice and shows that the person giving it has put time and thought into a greener alternative.

A survey conducted by the online secondhand marketplace Vinted found that one in six of us are committed to giving preloved gifts this Christmas, and buying secondhand can also help to combat the £42m worth of unwanted Christmas gifts sent to landfill each year.

With the help of @mackaylucy, founder of east London-based vintage children’s clothing site @andtheywear, vintage homeware seller @scenebychloe, Depop seller Anna O’Brien and vintage influencer @knackered_cow, here are seven essential rules for preloved and perfect secondhand presents to make your Christmas a more thoughtful - and perhaps less consumerist one.

"It is the festival that celebrates the triumph of light over darkness, and this year Diwali held a special significance for India as it got back into full swing for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began.

Oil lamps lit up windows, shops, homes and monuments across the country and devotees gathered at temples and shrines, as excitement over the festival, severely dampened last year by Covid-19, gripped the country once more.

In the holy city of Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh, 900,000 earthen lamps were lit on the banks of the Sarayu River as dusk fell on Wednesday. Hindus believe the city is the birthplace of the god Ram. In Amritsar, the Sikh Golden temple was enveloped in fairy lights.

In accordance with longstanding tradition to mark the festival, the armies of India and Pakistan exchanged sweets at the Tithwal crossing bridge on the Line of Control that divides parts of Kashmir.

The Hindu festival represents new beginnings, but for many who lost their relatives and loved ones in the devastating second wave that swept through India last spring it was the first Diwali without family members.

Shriya Chatterjee, 42, whose mother died in April from the virus, said the festival would not be the same without her. ""She had all these traditions she would make us do every year and would boss us all around to make sure everything was perfect. It would drive me crazy but now this year I’m making sure we celebrate as she would have. But I’ve avoided parties and we are keeping it small, to be cautious because we know that Covid hasn’t gone away.”

India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had urged people to take precautions and to be wary of Covid. Though, in the capital, celebrations were in full swing in the days leading up to the festival.

For residents there, the morning of Diwali also brought with it the annual spectre of pollution as air quality hit hazardous levels.

Oil lamps lit up windows shops homes and monuments across the country and devotees gathered at temples and shrines as excitement over the festival severely dampened last year by Covid19 gripped the country once more

In the holy city of Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh 900000 earthen lamps were lit on the banks of the Sarayu River as dusk fell on Wednesday Hindus believe the city is the birthplace of the god Ram In Amritsar the Sikh Golden temple was enveloped in fairy lights

In accordance with longstanding tradition to mark the festival the armies of India and Pakistan exchanged sweets at the Tithwal crossing bridge on the Line of Control that divides parts of Kashmir

The Hindu festival represents new beginnings but for many who lost their relatives and loved ones in the devastating second wave that swept through India last spring it was the first Diwali without family members

Shriya Chatterjee 42 whose mother died in April from the virus said the festival would not be the same without her She had all these traditions she would make us do every year and would boss us all around to make sure everything was perfect It would drive me crazy but now this year Im making sure we celebrate as she would have But Ive avoided parties and we are keeping it small to be cautious because we know that Covid hasnt gone away

Indias prime minister Narendra Modi had urged people to take precautions and to be wary of Covid Though in the capital celebrations were in full swing in the days leading up to the festival

"There were plenty of memorable moments at this year's Bafta awards ceremony.

Highlights included Bukky Bakray' ecstatic reaction after winning the rising star award and 73-year-old South Korean actress Youn Yuh-jung jokingly referring to the British as ""snobbish people"" after being crowned best supporting actress.

The event was held virtually and, after an outcry last year when an all-white acting contenders list was presented, more than half of this year's 24 nominees were actors of colour.

Guardian film critic, Peter Bradshaw, described the award winners as ""a satisfying Bafta list, topped off by the grownup artistry of Chloé Zhao"" who became only the second woman to pick up the best director award.

"As we look back on 2021, this image stays so prominently in our minds.

It shows Ndakasi, an orphaned mountain gorilla living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, lying in the arms of her caregiver, Andre Bauma, taking her final breath. She died aged 14 in September after a prolonged illness.

Ndakasi was just two months old when rangers found her clinging to the lifeless body of her mother, who had been gunned down by armed militia in 2007. Bauma comforted her that first night by holding her to his bare chest and had continued caring for her since then.

This hauntingly powerful image reminds us of what our relationship with animals can be - and how significant these are.

Ndakasi, who famously posed in the background of a selfie taken by rangers at Virunga national park, was transferred to the Senkwekwe Center after its creation in 2009 and lived with other orphaned mountain gorillas viewed as too vulnerable to return to the wild.

A number of the orphans here were rescued from sales by poachers in sting operations carried out by Congolese National Park Authority (ICCN) rangers.

Virunga national park in eastern DRC is home to some of the world’s last mountain gorillas. Neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda are also home to mountain gorillas, and together their population has recently risen to more than 1,000.

Nearly 700 rangers in Virunga park risk their lives to protect its wildlife in a region that has faced more than two decades of armed conflict and instability.

Mr Bauma and others at the Senkwekwe Center had cared for Ndakasi and other orphans for 13 years. This is the only mountain gorilla orphanage in the world and takes in mountain gorilla orphans who have lost their families to poaching or conflict.

“It was a privilege to support and care for such a loving creature,” Bauma said in a statement when this image was released in October.

“It was Ndakasi’s sweet nature and intelligence that helped me to understand the connection between humans and great apes and why we should do everything in our power to protect them.”

Bauma said he was proud to have called Ndakasi a friend.

"Using a macro lens, Karine Aigner captured this remarkable photo of ""wings-whirring"" and the flurry of activity as a buzzing ball of cactus bees spin over the hot sand in South Texas.

The image won the Grand Title award in the Natural History Museum’s prestigious Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition.

""The sense of movement and intensity is shown at bee-level magnification and transforms what are little cactus bees into big competitors for a single female,"" said chair of the jury, Rosamund Kidman Cox.

The world’s bees are under threat from habitat loss, pesticides and climate change. With 70% of bee species nesting underground, experts say it is increasingly important that areas of natural soil are left undisturbed.

"""Seeing one in real life is indescribable.""

This is the moment marine biologist, Jacinta Shackleton, spotted a dazzling blanket octopus in the wild off the coast of Lady Elliot Island in the Great Barrier Reef.

The technicolour marine mollusc has only been seen a handful of times in the wild, making it one of the rarest sights in the marine world.

“When I first saw it, I thought it could have been a juvenile fish with long fins, but as it came closer, I realised it was a female blanket octopus and I had this overwhelming sense of joy and excitement,” Shackleton said.

“I kept yelling through my snorkel, ‘it’s a blanket octopus!’ I was so excited I was finding it difficult to hold my breath to dive down and video it.”

Blanket octopuses are extremely rare. The first sighting of a live male was made 21 years ago just north of the Great Barrier Reef.

While females grow up to 2 metres in length, the males have only been seen to grow to about 2.4cm long.

Males also don’t develop the blanket octopus’s iridescent “blanket” that makes the species so alluring. For the females that do develop it, the display can be shed to elude predators.

The extreme difference between the sexes is thought to have developed because of the blanket octopus’s unique habit of carrying blue-bottle stingers for self-defence.

“Seeing one in real life is indescribable, I was so captivated by its movements, it was as if it was dancing through the water with a flowing cape. The vibrant colours are just so incredible, you can’t take your eyes off it.""

“I’ve truly never seen anything like it before and don’t think I ever will again in my life.”

"How many people do you share a Netflix password with?

The world of password sharing on the streaming service is soon to be history, and the company yesterday accidentally posted guidelines for how they would be cracking down on the practice.

Netflix said the mistakenly launched guidelines are being trialled in Chile, Peru and Costa Rica had been posted accidentally across its help centre pages including in the US on Wednesday, but had since been taken down.

Since last year Netflix has been trialling “paid sharing” in the three countries where an account holder pays for an extra person, located outside the account holder’s home, to access the service. In Costa Rica the fee is $2.99 (£2.44) a month.

To ensure that a Netflix account is not being shared outside of the household where it is registered, the trial requires users to connect their viewing device – such as a TV, mobile phone or tablet – to the wifi in their home, open the Netflix app and watch something on the streaming service at least once every 31 days.

Although Netflix has yet to unveil its plans to tackle account sharing worldwide, the trial is the closest indication to what a global approach might look like.

Netflix, which has 230 million subscribers worldwide, said last month that account sharing “undermines our long-term ability to invest in and improve Netflix”.

However as one Twitter user pointed out, they haven't always thought this. Netflix tweeted in 2017 that 'love is sharing a password'. Swipe for more of what a few users had to say on Twitter.

"Colin Powell, the first Black US secretary of state, has died at the age of 84 from complications from Covid-19.

In a statement on Facebook, his family said: We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American."" They also said that Powell was fully vaccinated and thanked the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their ""caring treatment"".

Powell, who was wounded in Vietnam, rose to occupy the top military position in the US government as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff between 1989 and 1993, but it was in the build up to the contentious invasion of Iraq that Powell became a household name.

He was the face of the Bush administration’s aggressive attempt to get the world community to back the invasion, based on false claims of Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction. 

Powell stepped down as secretary of state in November 2004, following Bush’s re-election. He later insisted to reporters that he had tried to warn Bush of the consequences of invading Iraq, but had supported the president when the decision to proceed was taken.

In a statement on Monday, Bush called Powell “a great public servant… He was such a favorite of Presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom – twice. He was highly respected at home and abroad.”

Powell considered a bid to become the first Black president in 1996 but his wife Alma's worries about his safety helped him decide otherwise.

And after his time in government, Powell remained a hugely influential commentator on US politics and public life. Over the years he grew increasingly distanced from his own Republican party, disillusioned by its rightward drift. 

In 2008, despite party rivalries, he endorsed Barack Obama for president. When Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House, Powell became one of his leading critics.

"What do these sculptures make you think of?

They form the first permanent artwork to honour the Windrush generation in the UK and were unveiled in the east London borough of Hackney on Friday to mark the first day of Black History Month.

The artist, Veronica Ryan, pictured on the second slide, created three sculptures in bronze and marble of Caribbean fruits; Custard Apple (Annonaceae), Breadfruit (Moraceae) and Soursop (Annonaceae).

Ryan says the use of these fruits ties into the narrative of migration and movement; “I grew up in the 1950s. My parents moved between London and Watford. I remember some of the complexities my parents had during the 1950s. I remembered my mum and some of her friends discovering Ridley Road market, and my mother bought fabrics and threads. I remembered some of the fruits and vegetables.”

She hopes the artwork will foster a sense of ownership amongst the local community and provide a vital public space to celebrate their cultural heritage.

“I’m hoping that the community will recognise themselves through my choices. Through breadfruit, soursop, a custard apple, that the community will say: ‘Oh my goodness, oh I know those. Those are things we grew on trees back home,’” she said.

Carole Williams, the lead member for the council’s response to the Windrush scandal, described the permanent artwork as “another step on the road to doing the work that we committed to do as a council when we passed the comprehensive Windrush motion back in 2018, which was the first of its kind in the country”.

The motion has two strands: policy work that calls for an end to the hostile environment policies, challenging the impact it continues to have on the Windrush generation and their descendants; and celebrating and honouring the community.

"""A lot of pictures of homeless people are really sad. I didn’t want to do that. There is some joy in these people, and that’s what I wanted to show.""

New York photographer, @billbernstein, says he was feeling 'helpless' about the city's problem with homelessness – and he wanted to do something to bring a little attention to the issue.

Bernstein used to help serve dinner at the Bowery Mission, a Christian rescue centre, around Thanksgiving and Christmas time - and asked organisers if he could do some portraits of their regular users.

He says: ""I was interested when couples arrived at the centre as it was clear that they lived together on the streets. These guys were such a great pair. When they smiled, I was like: that’s the picture.

""My plan was to focus on faces and eyes, because we so often walk down the street and see somebody and we don’t want to actually look at them or engage.""

Bernstein says he wanted to capture the togetherness of the couple and to give a sense of what their relationship felt like.

""I think they felt really special having all the lights and cameras and attention on them when doing this project. I hope that feeling lasted for a while.""

Neal, the department head, and Wilson, Viola Davis’s personal hair stylist, won for their work on the film about one of the few openly lesbian, black performers in America in the 1920s.

Neal, left in the picture above, designed Oprah Winfrey’s wigs for 2017’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. As reported by Vogue, she created 100 wigs for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom in less than three weeks, based on the fewer than 10 photographs that exist of the legendary “mother of blues"".

“I know that one day it won’t be unusual or groundbreaking, it will just be normal” for black women, trans women, and Latinas to be claiming Oscars, Neal said.

The film’s costume designer, Ann Roth, 89, also made history as the oldest woman to win an Oscar, tying Agnés Varda and James Ivory for the oldest winners.

"Fleetwood Mac’s Christine McVie has died at the age of 79, her family has said.

A statement on Facebook said: “On behalf of Christine McVie’s family, it is with a heavy heart we are informing you of Christine’s death.

“She passed away peacefully at hospital this morning, Wednesday, November 30th 2022, following a short illness. She was in the company of her family. We kindly ask that you respect the family’s privacy at this extremely painful time and we would like everyone to keep Christine in their hearts and remember the life of an incredible human being, and revered musician who was loved universally. RIP Christine McVie.”

The British-American rock band, founded in London in 1967, sold more than 100m records worldwide, making them one of the most successful groups ever. Their best-known songs include Dreams, Go Your Own Way and Everywhere.

The band paid tribute to the singer-songwriter McVie in a statement on Wednesday night following news of her death. “There are no words to describe our sadness at the passing of Christine McVie. She was truly one-of-a-kind, special and talented beyond measure.

The statement on Twitter continued: “She was the best musician anyone could have in their band and the best friend anyone could have in their life.

“We were so lucky to have a life with her. Individually and together, we cherished Christine deeply and are thankful for the amazing memories we have. She will be so very missed.”

McVie’s death comes two years after Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died at the age of 73.

"A moving documentary about Colette, a former resistance fighter, who travelled to visit the concentration camp where her brother died has won an Oscar.

Colette Marin-Catherine, one of the last surviving members of the French Resistance, always refused to set foot in Germany but this changed when a young history student named Lucie entered her life. Together they travel to what remains of the forced labour camp near Nordhausen, Germany, in a journey of discovery that reopens old wounds and lessons of the past.

The film, which you can watch in full via the link in our bio, was released by the Guardian and directed by Anthony Giacchino.

Speaking on stage at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night producer Alice Doyard said: “This award is a tribute to women of any ages who are joining hands and fighting for justice.”

Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News & Media said: “This Academy Award is a real honour and a fantastic achievement for everyone behind this powerful and deeply moving documentary.""

"“For every trans, non-binary, gender non-conforming person … this is for you,” said J Harrison Ghee, after winning the award for best actor in a leading role in a musical for Some Like It Hot and becoming one of the first ever non-binary winners of an acting award at the Tony’s.

Alex Newell was also named best featured actor in a musical for their role in Shucked.

“I should not be up here, as a queer, non-binary, fat, Black little baby from Massachusetts,” said Newell as they accepted the award.

This year’s Tony awards ceremony was almost cancelled as a result of the writers strike, but an agreement on 15 May meant that the night would not be picketed as long as it was unscripted.

"Self-control ... it's a trait many of us often struggle to exercise. It's linked with higher intelligence - and a new study has now found it is something cuttlefish are also able to exert.

Researchers used an adapted version of the Stanford marshmallow test, in which children were given the choice of scoffing an immediate reward (one marshmallow) or waiting to earn a delayed, but better, reward (two marshmallows) on six cuttlefish in an aquarium environment.

Overtime - and overall - the chunky squid-like creatures delayed gratification when it led to a prey item of higher quality. The eight-armed animals were able to maintain delays for periods of up to 50 seconds to 130 seconds, the authors said.

As well as humans - and now seemingly cuttlefish - chimps, parrots and crows have also evolved to exert self-control.

Previous research had suggested that some primates and birds exhibited this advanced level of self-control because they were social species that maintained multiple relationships and used tools.

Instead, the study's author speculates self-control might have evolved in cuttlefish to maximise efficiency.

"DMX, the New York rapper whose gruff tone electrified the US music scene in the late 1990s, has died aged 50.

The star, whose real name was Earl Simmons, was hospitalised after a heart attack on 2 April, and had been placed in a critical care unit at White Plains hospital, New York. His family had organised a prayer vigil outside, which took place on Monday.

“Earl was a warrior who fought till the very end,” a statement from his family read. “He loved his family with all of his heart and we cherish the times we spent with him. Earl’s music inspired countless fans across the world and his iconic legacy will live on forever. We appreciate all of the love and support during this incredibly difficult time.”

His label Def Jam Records wrote: “DMX was a brilliant artist and an inspiration to millions around the world. His message of triumph over struggle, his search for the light out of darkness, his pursuit of truth and grace brought us closer to our own humanity. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those who loved him and were touched by him.”

"A party founded by school climate strikers is standing in the German local elections, hoping to entice Green party supporters and first-time voters.

Despite living in the only state in Germany led by the Green party, some people in Baden-Württemberg believe not enough is being done in responding to the climate emergency.

The political party, called Klimaliste, has policies aimed at ensuring the Paris agreement climate pledges are not breached. It's also a response to the Green party giving more support to the powerful local car industry than to renewable energy.

Two of Klimaliste’s (Climate List) founders were leaders of the student climate strikes sparked by Greta Thunberg in 2019. To run in the election, the founders had to register Klimaliste as a party, recruit two candidates for each of the 70 districts in the state and collect 5,000 signatures – all during the pandemic.

Klimaliste’s policies include a total switch to renewables within five years, a fair transition away from fossil fuels, the introduction of a citizens’ assembly and lowering the voting age.",2021-03-11 21:30:56,"A party founded by school climate strikers is standing in the German local elections hoping to entice Green party supporters and firsttime voters

"For nearly 1,300 years, no one knew it was there ...

The name of a highly educated English woman, secretly scratched on to the pages of a rare medieval manuscript in the eighth century, but impossible to read – until now.

Academics have discovered the Old English female name Eadburg was repeatedly scored into the surface of the religious text, using a method that kept it hidden from the naked eye for more than 12 centuries.

The covert writing of the woman’s name was finally revealed when researchers at the Bodleian Library in Oxford used cutting-edge technology to capture the 3D surface of the ancient manuscript, a Latin copy of the Acts of the Apostles that was made in England between AD700 and AD750.

It is the first time this technology, capable of revealing “almost invisible” markings so shallow they measure about a fifth of the width of a human hair, has been used to record annotations on the surface of a manuscript.

“There are only a limited number of surviving early medieval manuscripts which contain clear internal evidence of a woman having created, owned or used them,” said Jessica Hodgkinson, a PhD student at the University of Leicester who made the discovery while researching her thesis on women and early medieval manuscripts.

Writing Eadburg’s name on the book quietly asserted her power and high status at a time when only a few elite, highly educated women were able to write and read both Old English and Latin. “It’s a hugely significant and very powerful text – the word of God, conveyed through the apostles. And I think that might be at least part of the reason why somebody chose to write Eadburg’s name into it, so that she was close to that.”

“Still, to this day, there’s this human urge to leave a mark of your presence on something that is meaningful to you or is a record of where you’ve been,” said Hodgkinson.

“We don’t know all that much about Eadburg, but now, because of this amazing technology, we’ve seen her name, we know she was there. She’s here, in this book – and it speaks across the centuries.”

"""I grew up watching her. That's the reason I play tennis. I saw somebody who looked like me dominating the game and it made me believe I could dominate too""

Coco Gauff has said Serena Williams inspired her to play tennis after the 23-time grand slam champion's decision to 'evolve away' from the sport.

Athletes and commentators around the world have been praising Williams's legacy of 'inspiring and motivating other women in sports'.

But her greatest achievement has nothing to do with Wimbledon, any grand slam or any tennis racket, says sports journalist and former publisher and editor-in-chief of Women in Sport magazine, Natasha Henry.

""Rather it is the way she continues trying to create a world where little girls who look like her and me don’t need to suffer the things she did or feel excluded from the worlds that we often were.""

"'We were lied to'

In the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections, the punditocracy of commentators, pollsters and political-types united behind the threat of a looming ""red wave"" of Republican gains.

But one dissenting voice stood out: that of leftist film-maker Michael Moore. Against all the commonplace predictions, he had forecast Democrats would do well. He called it a “blue tsunami”.

That proved to be true in his home state of Michigan, where Democrats won governor, house and senate for the first time in 40 years, often by large margins. It’s been more of a blue wall across the rest of the country, where Republican gains mostly failed to materialize, with the exception of Florida. 

But even so, the strong performance by Democrats has stunned people on both sides of the US political divide, delighting the left and sparking hand-wringing on the right.

With the Democrats retaining power in the Senate, and Republicans poised to take the House by only a handful of seats (vastly falling below expectations), suddenly Moore is looking like a prognosticator par excellence.

"Can you see the resemblance?

The cultural icon @rupaulofficial has become the first drag queen to be forever enshrined as a soldier fly.

The RuPaul fly is part of a new Australian genus named Opaluma (from the Latin words for opal and thorn), because they look like “little gems buzzing around the forest floor” and have a distinctive thorn tucked under their abdomen.

It is 50th species to be named by @csirogram entomologist Bryan Lessard. A decade ago, the first insect he named after a pop culture icon was the Beyoncé fly – Scaptia beyonceae, in 2011.

At the time, it caused quite a stir, and was “frowned upon” by some taxonomists, but @bry_the_fly_guy said the growing naming practice had helped threatened species gain attention in response to environmental threats such as climate change.

Lessard said naming the soldier fly Opaluma rupaul came as an “obvious decision”.

“I was watching a lot of RuPaul’s Drag Race while examining the species and I know it would challenge RuPaul on the runway serving fierce looks,” Lessard said.

“It has a costume of shiny metallic rainbow colours, and it has legs for days. I think once (Ru) sees the fly she’ll realise it’s quite fierce and hopefully appreciate the name.”

He hopes CSIRO's work will encourage citizen scientists and conservationists to help to monitor wildlife and insects, part of a national push for scientists to document and name every Australian species.

“We really need to encourage next generation to help us name and describe and protect our unique biodiversity in Australia.”

"What do you think is the secret to lifelong friendship? 🤝

Friendships often start by accident, like choosing neighbouring lockers at school or attending the same party or protest ... but staying friends over a lifetime can’t be accidental.

Friends are essential to our health and happiness, and can even affect how long we live, according to a new study. But how do you keep a relationship alive when you are living in different places and can barely make time for yourself? We asked Guardian readers who have maintained friendships for decades, what they think has made these relationships last.

"Could you imagine turning yourself into art?

That’s exactly what Laetitia Ky does.

She’s an artist and activist from the Ivory Coast who makes sculptures out of her hair. Her pieces are moments, scenes, statements, emotions, rendered in black afro-textured hair – each one displayed on her head.

There are no gimmicks, technological cheats or shortcuts. Ky, 25, doesn’t even create the sculpture on a flat surface or stand and then attach them to her head.

She says her work focuses on empowering women and exploring gender and racial inequality, and that after starting she realised: ""that maybe what I was doing was more powerful than I thought it was"".

But how exactly did this idea, and her exploration of beauty styles of African women before colonisation, begin?

"In rainy conditions on the foothills of Mount Fuji, Dame Sarah Storey completed a journey she began 29 years ago, as she won her 17th gold medal to become, outright, the most successful British Paralympian of all time.

Storey made her maiden Paralympic appearance in Barcelona as a swimmer at the age of 14. She competed in the pool at the following three games and won five gold medals before switching to cycling in 2008. Since then, her success has only accelerated, winning nine golds across Beijing, London and Rio before her latest treble in Tokyo took her past the total set by the swimmer Mike Kenny between 1976 and 1988.

Reflecting on her success is not something that comes readily to Storey who, after her victory, practically confirmed she intends to race again when the Paralympics head to Paris in 2024.

“I just wanted to be a British athlete, I wanted to compete for my country for as long as I possibly could. I couldn’t have imagined having eight Games, let alone winning medals at every Games, and 17 of those medals being gold. It’s the dream I didn’t have, coming true.”

"There's high fashion ... and then there's higher taxes fashion, as @AOC has shown at this year's Met Gala. 

The New York congresswoman turned heads at the annual event, wearing a white gown by Brother Vellies containing a not-so-hidden message: tax the rich.

It was AOC's first appearance at the ball and, as you might expect, has sparked a somewhat predictable yet fierce debate on social media.

While many have embraced AOC's fashion statement, many of her critics have (once again) accused her of hypocrisy due to the costly and luxurious nature of the event, and partying with the elites she wants to tax. 

But what do you think? Does wanting the rich to pay more in taxes mean you can't party with them? Should AOC have protested outside instead? Or is it ok to endorse a wealth tax while also attending such a glitzy event? As Yale professor Jason Stanley tweeted: ""AOC is, in fact, pushing legislation to tax the rich. Good for her for making it cool. That’s why she’s going to win."" 

However, you may also be indifferent, and agree more with Melania Trump, who in 2018 famously wore a jacket emblazoned with the message: ""I really don't care, do u?""

Either way, the debate over whether democratic socialists can have nice things rages on.

"The votes are in: Ketanji Brown Jackson is the first Black woman to be appointed to the US supreme court in its 233-year history.

Jackson, who currently serves on the US court of appeals for the DC Circuit, will replace Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career, said he intends to retire from the court this summer.

At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court, dominated by a 6-3 conservative majority.

Her confirmation to the lifetime post represents the fulfillment of a promise Biden made to his supporters during his 2020 campaign for president, when he vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court, if elected president and a vacancy arose.

During her public hearings, Jackson vowed to be an independent justice who would seek to ensure that the words inscribed on the marbled supreme court building – Equal Justice Under the Law – were a “reality and not just an ideal”. 

With her parents and daughters present, Jackson recounted for the Senate judiciary committee her family’s generational journey, as the daughter of public school teachers raised in the segregated south who would rise to become a justice on a court that once denied Black Americans citizenship.",2022-04-07 21:01:17,"The votes are in Ketanji Brown Jackson is the first Black woman to be appointed to the US supreme court in its 233year history

"“As fires rage in the west, fueled by fossil fuel pollution, today’s ruling in Montana is a game-changer that marks a turning point in this generation’s efforts to save the planet from the devastating effects of human-caused climate chaos”.

This is what Julia Olson, founder of non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust, said on Monday after youth activists won the first constitutional climate trial in US history, in what leading US environmental lawyer Michael Gerrard called ""the strongest decision on climate change ever issued by any court”.

“I’m so speechless right now,” Eva, a plaintiff who was 14 when the suit was filed, said in a statement. “I’m really just excited and elated and thrilled.”

Sixteen young people, aged five to 22, sued the state of Montana earlier this year in the first youth-led climate case to make it to trial, accusing the state government’s pro-fossil fuel policies of contributing to climate change and violating their right to a healthy environment,

“This is a huge win for Montana, for youth, for democracy, and for our climate,” said Olson, whose non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust brought the suit alongside Western Environmental Law Center and McGarvey Law.

Youth-led constitutional climate lawsuits, brought by Our Children’s Trust, are also pending in four other states. One of those cases, brought by Hawaii youth plaintiffs, is set to go to trial in June 2024, attorneys announced last week.

“The case in Montana is a clear sign that seeking climate justice through the courts is a viable and powerful strategy,” said Delta Merner, lead scientist at the Science Hub for Climate Litigation at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

"The rapper Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr, has died at the age of 59 in Los Angeles, his manager has confirmed.

Coolio is best known for his 1995 single Gangsta’s Paradise, for which he won a Grammy for best solo rap performance. The runaway hit came from the soundtrack of the Michelle Pfeiffer film Dangerous Minds and sampled Stevie Wonder’s 1976 song Pastime Paradise.

He was nominated for five other Grammys during a career that began in the late 1980s. His career took off with the 1994 release of his debut album, It Takes a Thief, on Tommy Boy Records. 

A year later, Gangsta’s Paradise would become a No 1 single, with its haunting opening lyrics: “As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/ I take a look at my life and realize there’s nothin’ left/ ’cause I’ve been blastin’ and laughin’ so long that/ even my mama thinks that my mind is gone.”

Earlier this year, the song hit one billion views on YouTube. “I want to thank everybody for all the years of love and being there for me,” Coolio said in a video marking the milestone, Billboard reported. “I hope I got you through some good times and got you through some bad times.”

Pfeiffer was among those to pay tribute to the rapper. In a post on Instagram, the actress said: “Heartbroken to hear of the passing of the gifted artist @coolio. A life cut entirely too short … I remember him being nothing but gracious. 30 years later I still get chills when I hear (Gangsta’s Paradise).”

Rapper Ice Cube wrote on Twitter: “This is sad news. I witness first hand this man’s grind to the top of the industry. Rest In Peace.”

Born in Monessen, Pennsylvania, south of Pittsburgh, Coolio moved to Compton, California, where he went to community college. He worked as a volunteer firefighter and in airport security before devoting himself full-time to hip-hop. His early work for firefighting crews in the San Jose area was “a way to clean up”, he told the Los Angeles Times in 1994. “In firefighting training was discipline I needed. We ran every day. I wasn’t drinking or smoking or doing the stuff I usually did.”

"Can you feel her joy through the screen?!

Zaila Avant-garde twirled and leaped with excitement after winning the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

The 14-year-old from Harvey, Louisiana, became the first African American winner and only the second Black champion in the bee’s 96-year history.

She jumped and spun around after spelling the winning word, “murraya”, a genus of tropical Asiatic and Australian trees.

"An NFT of the original source code for the world wide web, written by its inventor Tim Berners-Lee, has sold for $5.4m in an online auction.

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a kind of crypto asset that records ownership of digital items, and has recently become a major asset in the creative world, with NFTs of artwork, music and internet memes selling for millions of dollars.

The NFT represents ownership of various digital items from when he invented the world wide web in 1989.

It is considered valuable by some because its basis in the blockchain authenticates that it is one-of-a-kind and has been officially created, or “minted”, by Berners-Lee himself.

“The symbolism, the history, the fact that they’re coming from the creator is what makes them valuable, and there are lots of people who collect things for exactly those reasons,” said Cassandra Hatton, the global head of science and popular culture at Sotheby’s auction house.

Included in the purchase are NFTs representing about 9,555 lines of code written in 1990-1991, a 30-minute animated visualisation of the code, a digital poster of the code, and a digital letter written by Berners-Lee in June 2021, reflecting on his invention.

The letter begins: “As people seemed to appreciate autographed versions of books, now we have NFT technology, I thought it could be fun to make an autographed copy of the original code of the first web browser.”

While walking the streets all day, he discovered a rich Jewish retiree enclave on the expansive beaches facing the Atlantic ocean. Godlis says he ended up shooting about 60 rolls of film.

""All these memories of Florida came flowing back to me. As I tripped the shutter over and over, taking pictures on those beaches I had walked upon as a little kid, everything clicked.""

""These retirees, all dressed up in their best beach outfits, would spend their days on loungers and lawn chairs, playing cards amid the sunshine and palm trees offering themselves as perfect subjects.""

"Why is Jeff Bezos flying to space? Because billionaires think Earth is a sinking ship, writes @guardian_us contributor Hamilton Nolan.

The Amazon founder hailed today as “the best day ever” after completing his pioneering foray into space with three crewmates, among them his brother Mark.

The billionaire’s New Shepard rocket and capsule touched down in the Texas desert after a suborbital flight that lasted a mere 11 minutes, but set several records for his Blue Origin space company, including the oldest and youngest humans to fly into space. 

Wally Funk, an 82-year-old female aviation pioneer who trained as an astronaut in the 1960s, flew as Bezos’s guest, while Oliver Daemen, 18, a student from the Netherlands and son of a private enquiry firm’s chief executive, was Blue Origin’s first paying customer.

The world’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $206bn, Bezos, 57, sprayed champagne and shouted his enjoyment after the successful landing of New Shepard’s first crewed mission following 15 uncrewed test flights.

"“It put a woman into every room of every person watching. It told viewers that women have a place in football, that they have authority and they can be athletic.”

This is how @guardian_sport's Suzanne Wrack spoke about the historical moment when three women made World Cup history.

Stéphanie Frappart, Neuza Back and Karen Díaz Medina were the first all-female officiating team for a men’s World Cup match, for Costa Rica v Germany.

French referee Stéphanie Frappart who lead the team, tweeted after the match: “I sincerely appreciate this wonderful opportunity given to me to referee today's match between. I also want to thank everyone for their support in believing in me, even as a woman. It is truly an honour.”

“Having Frappart standing in the middle of the pitch of the world’s biggest sporting tournament put a woman unavoidably centre stage.”

"The organisers of the Paris 2024 Olympics have unveiled spectacular and audacious plans for the biggest opening ceremony in history, with a 6km parade of athletes in boats along the River Seine watched by more than 600,000 people.

The athletes, who will be in more than 160 boats, will pass by the most iconic monuments, bridges and cultural institutions in Paris, including Notre Dame, the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower.⁣
⁣
Dozens of artistic performances are expected to take place along the Seine, including BMX stunt riders leaping high over bridges.

The ceremony will then conclude with a final show at the Place du Trocadéro, which faces the Eiffel Tower. Not only will the opening ceremony be bigger than ever before but, for the first time, most of it will be free to spectators.⁣
⁣
Tony Estanguet, the president of the Paris 2024 organising committee, says it will be the most “audacious and accessible” opening ceremony in history. “It’s not the easiest way to deliver the Games, but it is our duty to be really ambitious,” he said.

“It is the launch of the Olympics. It has to send a strong message that those Games will be unique. One billion people will watch the ceremony. We want them to feel the best of France. It will be a unique combination of a sport and cultural moment, with the entire city turned into a vast Olympic stadium.”⁣

"In 2015, Tom Turcich left his hometown in New Jersey with one destination: the world.

Pushed to consider the meaning of life after his close friend’s death when he was 17 and inspired by the film Dead Poets Society, Turcich started to make plans for his travels. He would endlessly study maps, working out the best routes. Much of it depended on practicalities such as which countries insisted on a visa.

At his sendoff, his father couldn’t have been more excited. “I was like, hey, go for it! Aw gee, just be careful, have a good time!” he says. “But his mother cried for months when he left.”

Eleven months of the first year was spent walking and sleeping out – typically behind churches and in woods. He came across tarantulas and snakes, particularly on the palm plantations where he slept in Costa Rica.

Turcich says he met so many wonderful people along the way. He was already an optimist when he set off, but by the time he returned he had even more faith in humankind, if less in some of the systems we live under.

“The first two years were about me and the mind. After that, it became much more about the world. I started to understand it more. I became more interested in what influences people and why countries are the way they are,” Turcich said.

Turcich walked 21-24 miles a day for roughly half of the seven years he was away. In total, he walked 28,000 miles and his dog Savannah 25,000 miles. He is the 10th person to have walked the world, and he assumes Savannah is the first dog to have done so.

"We can't even begin to imagine how uncomfortable this was ...

Wildlife officials in Colorado say an elusive elk that wandered the hills with a car tyre around its neck for at least two years has at last been freed.

The four-and-a-half-year-old - 270kg (600lb) - bull elk was spotted near Pine Junction, south-west of Denver, on Saturday evening and tranquillised, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

Officers with the agency had to cut off the elk’s five-point antlers to remove the object because they couldn’t slice through the steel in the bead of the tyre.

“We would have preferred to cut the tyre and leave the antlers for his rutting activity, but the situation was dynamic and we had to just get the tyre off in any way possible,” officer Scott Murdoch said.

Authorities explained that the rutting season - when a male elk looks to mate with female elk - played a role in helping officers find him.

Murdoch said: “The rut definitely made him more visible. There was a bigger bull in the group he was with on Saturday, but he is getting to be a decent size bull.”

Wildlife officers first spotted the elk in July 2019 while conducting a population survey for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the Mount Evans Wilderness. It has since spent the past couple of years travelling back and forth between Park and Jefferson counties.

They estimate that the elk was freed of about 16kg (35lb) in weight, and were surprised to see its neck was in good condition after two years of chafing.

“The hair was rubbed off a little bit, there was one small open wound maybe the size of a nickel or quarter, but other than that it looked really good,” Murdoch said. “I was actually quite shocked to see how good it looked.”

In the past, the officer have seen deer, elk, moose, bears and other wildlife have become entangled in a number of items, including swing sets, hammocks, clotheslines, decorative or holiday lighting, furniture, tomato cages, chicken feeders, laundry baskets, soccer goals and volleyball nets.

"Patrick Jones, 43, has been homeless since he was 12.

Pictured on the cover of this gallery, his portrait is one of the many powerful and thought provoking images featured in photographer Robert Gumpert’s new book, Division Street.

The project is an exploration of the stark divide between San Francisco’s haves and have-nots - and though all the pictures were captured in the Californian city, Gumpert told the SF Public Press, the book is “actually the story of America … I think it’s an honest look at today’s society.” 

A recent examination of 20 US urban areas found the number of deaths among people living without housing shot up by 77% in the five years ending in 2020.

In 2016, when the Super Bowl came to San Francisco, many homeless people were ‘urged’ to move to the ironically named Division Street. It’s reported that city officers hoped this would mean those sleeping rough would remain ‘invisible’ to the visiting crowds.

At the same time, Gumpert started talking with and photographing people he met who were living on the street and in shelters. He says: ‘Without the understanding of the people I have met on the streets, their remarkable generosity of spirit and trust, this project would never have happened.’

"""Sleep is one of the most powerful things you can do for your body.""

Many of us are hoping for a happier, healthier life in 2023. We may already be trying lifestyle changes, but, regardless of your specific goal, it is hard to achieve anything when you haven't had enough sleep.

On the flip side, everything seems more possible when you are well rested. Sleep boosts the immune system, regulates mood and metabolism, and can make you more productive, patient or creative.

In his book, The Seven-Day Sleep Prescription, psychologist Aric Prather claims that, while we are built for sleep, many of us still struggle to overcome insomnia; “Sleep is one of the most powerful things you can do for your body. It’s just critical to make that a priority. Life is hard, there is always stress, sleep is disrupted, but there are things we can do.”

A professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, Prather practises cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment of insomnia (CBTI).

This picture of two great crested grebes was taken by @m.l.harder at the Pendle View holiday park in Lancashire. “There was only one grebe the day before and I was hoping to photograph it,” he said.

“Out of nowhere, both came along and started dancing in front of me just as the sun came over Pendle Hill. This was an incredible moment and one I’ve enjoyed reminiscing over the last year.”

"Groundbreaking author and activist, bell hooks, who has died at the age of 69, inspired countless people through her writing on feminism, love, white supremacy, intersectionality, capitalism and the power of art.

Broadcaster and writer @afuahirsch commented that “reading bell hooks was an experience of profound relief. She had powerfully identified and articulated, with characteristic intellectual rigour, phenomena which I instinctively perceived but had never seen vocalised.”

hooks’ first major work, Ain’t I a Woman?, was published in 1981, and became widely recognised as an important feminist text and named one of the 20 most influential women’s books in the last two decades by Publishers Weekly in 1992.

She went on to write All About Love, Bone Black, Feminist Theory and Communion: The Female Search for Love, which all also became beacons for a generation of writers and thinkers in academia and beyond.

"🚨 Some personal news: it's our 200th birthday today.

The Guardian has come a long way since that first print run of 1,000 copies, which appeared in Manchester for the princely sum of seven pence.

Now we have tens of millions of readers around the world - and several million articles later - we're proud to say we're older than Germany, fish 'n' chips, the FA Cup, the bicycle and the state of Texas.

So for the next few days and weeks, we plan to make the most of this moment, sharing some of the journalism that changed the world, and reminding ourselves that we don’t always get things right, that not everyone agrees with us.

As our editor-in-chief Katharine Viner writes today, ""the Guardian is not the only newspaper to declare that it has a higher purpose than transmitting the day’s events in order to make a profit. But it might be unique in having held on to that sense of purpose for two centuries.""

We hope you have enjoyed your time with us so far, whether you've found us recently online, on Instagram, or have been with us since you were young and starting picking us up off your family table; this is your anniversary to celebrate too. 

Thank you for all your support.

"Democrats have kept control of the Senate after the crucial race in Nevada was announced in their favor, cementing a midterms election performance for the party that widely beat expectations.

Democratic US senator Catherine Cortez Masto has now beaten Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former president Donald Trump, the Associated Press said.

With Masto’s victory coming on the heels of Democratic senator Mark Kelly winning re-election in Arizona late on Friday, the win takes the Democrats to the crucial number of 50 seats in the Senate, with the Republicans at 49. 

The race in Georgia is set to go to a runoff in December, but even if Republicans win there, a 50-50 split means the Senate would effectively be controlled by the Democrats because the tying vote falls to the vice-president, Kamala Harris.

For the Republicans, it was another blow after they steeply underperformed in many races. The party had touted hopes of a “red wave” that could sweep across the US and deliver the upper chamber of Congress into their hands. Instead – with a few exceptions, such as Florida – the wave was more of a trickle.

The Democrat win in the Senate is likely to prompt further recrimination in Republican circles over who is to blame for the poor showing. 

Much attention has so far focused on Trump after he backed rightwing or celebrity candidates in several key races who lost, such as Dr Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania.

The victory is also another boost for president Joe Biden after his party defied immediate fears that his low popularity ratings and an electorate battered by high inflation would translate to punishment at the polls. 

The Democrats also defied historical precedent, as the party holding the White House often loses heavily in midterm elections.",2022-11-13 08:12:12,"Democrats have kept control of the Senate after the crucial race in Nevada was announced in their favor cementing a midterms election performance for the party that widely beat expectations

"How can you manipulate the weather?

Chinese weather authorities successfully controlled the weather ahead of a major political celebration earlier this year, according to a Beijing university study.

On 1 July the Chinese Communist party marked its centenary with major celebrations including tens of thousands of people at a ceremony in Tiananmen Square, and a research paper from Tsinghua University has said an extensive cloud-seeding operation in the hours prior ensured clear skies and low air pollution.

Cloud-seeding is a weather modification technique, which sees the adding of chemicals like small particles of silver iodide, to clouds, causing water droplets to cluster around them and increasing the chance of precipitation.

The researchers said in this instance the resulting artificial rain reduced the level of PM2.5 air pollutants by more than two-thirds, and shifted the air quality index reading, based on World Health Organization standards, from “moderate” to “good”.

The Chinese government has been an enthusiastic proponent of cloud-seeding technology, spending billions of dollars on efforts to manipulate the weather to protect agricultural regions or improve significant events including the 2008 Olympics.

Last year Beijing announced plans to expand its experimental weather modification program to an area 1.5 times the size of India covered by artificial rain or snow.

While there is a growing body of scientific evidence around the success of cloud-seeding, there is also a debate about whether manipulating the weather in one area could disrupt weather systems elsewhere.

"The day Russian troops invaded Ukraine, 18-year-old Oleksandr Ivanov was shot in the forehead and 10 times in the chest while in the passenger seat of his grandmother’s car. 

Oleksandr, known as Sasha, did not have the life of an ordinary teenager. His mother, Sveta, was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy when Sasha was three. He had spent his life taking care of her, helping her dress, wash and go to the toilet.

Sasha had a natural love of learning, according to his family. From when he started to talk, he loved reciting poetry. At the age of seven he asked if he could learn to play the piano. Despite finishing music school with honours, he decided to study medicine so he could become a neurosurgeon to help cure his mother’s disease.

When they celebrated Christmas in Hostomel, near Kyiv, last year, the Ivanov family could not have imagined what 2022 would bring.

He was killed trying to help his grandparents.

Elon Musk has responded by threatening to sue Meta, and saying Twitter had “serious concerns that Meta Platforms (Meta) has engaged in systematic, willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property”.

“Competition is fine, cheating is not,” he later tweeted.

Our media editior Jim Waterson tested it out and said: “After a day using Threads, one thing is pretty clear: it is not Twitter …”

“Instead, Threads has the potential to be something different and powerful: Twitter with fewer rough edges, more corporate sheen, and enough potential to suck the remaining life – and advertising revenue – out of Musk’s struggling network.”

Zuckerberg told a user on the app that: “The goal is to keep it friendly as it expands … That’s one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently.”

But many say it’s early days yet and Threads are reminiscent of what Twitter once was.

Others are also keen to point out the potential issues of an even greater dominance of Meta on social media – it already owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, to which Threads is linked – and about the huge amount of personal data the app freely acknowledges it is collecting about users.

"Who keeps the dog after divorce?

That is something the Spanish courts will now decide under a new law that considers a pet's welfare when couples divorce or break-up.

The legal shift comes after similar moves in France and Portugal and obliges judges to consider pets as sentient beings rather than objects or property owned by one or the other partner - something that is still in place in most countries.

""Animals are part of the family and when a family decides to separate, the fate of the animal must be regulated with the same importance as the fate of other family members,"" said lawyer Lola Garcia, 42.

In October, a Madrid judge gave joint custody of a dog to an unmarried couple who sought a court ruling on whom the pet should stay with after they separated. The dog spends a month with each of them and both are legally responsible.

Previously, a lawyer seeking joint custody of a pet had to prove both members of a couple owned the animal as an object, giving whoever had registered the pet an advantage.

Garcia, whose Rights&Animals firm handled the case, considers the reform a major first step in a series of forthcoming legal changes governing people's relationship with animals.

Now a judge has to determine where the animal will fare better and that determination is based on the animal's wellbeing Garcia explained.

A partner that can demonstrate financial solvency or who has been granted custody of their children has a better chance of securing custody of any pets too, as there is a special affective link between children and animals, she added.

"""It's like an antidote to despair""

In the midst of the UK's deepening cost of living crisis, our journalists John Harris and John Domokos went in search of hope.

Touring England and Wales they met a new type of community activist: the people dealing with hunger, poverty and loneliness, but who are also trying to push towards a better future.

They spoke to dozens of people about what life has been like for them, including Julia, who has been helping at the Selby Trust, a food hub in Tottenham, north London, since the day it opened.

""This has been going on for too long. We're in poverty – what are you [the government] going to do about it?"" she says.

All the groups who took part in this film – the last in our video series Anywhere but Westminster for this year – are part of Locality, one of two charities the Guardian is partnering with for our annual charity appeal.

Locality and Citizens Advice, the other charity our readers have been supporting, are at the heart of the voluntary response to rising hardship in some of the country's most deprived neighbourhoods. Their vital work delivers immediate crisis support and hope for the future.

"It has taken her 12 years, 450 hours and at least 1.5m strokes, but the Chloë McCardel has become the queen of the Channel by swimming the stretch of water between England and France for the 44th time.

“I’m so thankful,"" said the 36-year-old Australian after breaking the record. “So many people helped along the way to make my dreams come true and hopefully I can inspire the next generation of open water swimmers and young people to go after their dreams.”

Last year she surpassed the men’s world record of 34 crossings and this week she passed the record of 43 crossings held by British swimmer Alison Streeter. It’s been a hell of a journey. She has suffered from hypothermia and battled boredom, pain and jellyfish. Whatever the experience, the stretch of water kept calling her back. “The first time I really felt like I’d found where I belonged,” she says. “Like my whole life has been heading to this one point. But I have a love-hate relationship with the Channel. On the bad days it’s like the French shoreline or the wind is tormenting me. But I’m drawn to it. It has this incredible, almost magical pull. I call it my spiritual home.”

McCardel hopes her feats of endurance, skill and grit will inspire other women. She speaks openly about being a survivor of domestic violence, and credits swimming with helping her begin to recover from PTSD. “After going through so much trauma, swimming the Channel helped rebuild my confidence, which was shaken a lot. My sense of identity and my sense of self worth was shaken.""

Crossing the Channel a record number of times occasionally seemed crazy, even to her. “There’s no logic behind it. It is basically like, how much punishment can your mind and body take before everything breaks?

The rules are strict: she cannot wear a wetsuit or anything that could provide protection – even a thermal swimming cap. McCardel only learned to swim when she was 11, but soon started swimming competitively. At 19, she decided she wanted to be the best in the world at something and took up marathon swimming. “It’s been a really tough journey,” she says. “But I’ve persisted.""

"A man named Serbest Salih is behind an unique project in Turkey, where children, most of them refugees, have been given analogue cameras and taught the art of photography.

He is one of an estimated 100,000 refugees living in the historic city of Mardin in south-eastern Turkey, just a few miles from the Syrian border.

And his life changed dramatically in 2017 when he discovered a sprawling refugee community living in a group of abandoned government buildings in the working-class Kurdish district of Istayson.

""It was a place where Turkish and Syrian Kurds lived as neighbours, but did not communicate. They were strangers who spoke the same language. It was at that moment I thought to use analogue photography as a means to integrate the different communities.""

Salih studied photography at college in Aleppo, before fleeing Syria with his family in 2014 as Islamic State fighters advanced on his home town of Kobani.

Children from the age of seven come to his workshops to learn the traditional skills of shooting on film and processing the results in a darkroom.

The results as a new book, i saw the air fly, shows are often surprising.
Rather than reflect the traumas of their displacement, the pictures tend towards the innocent and joyous: family portraits, blurred shots of their friends at play, children jumping, hiding, posing with their friends or tending their animals.

""When they start using them, something magical happens. They start to show the world they live in through their own eyes.""

""People think that if you give a refugee child a camera, the results will be sad, but instead most of these photographs are all about joy. They are small moments of private happiness.""

All proceeds from the sale of i saw the air fly will go to the Her Yerde Sanat-Sirkhane charity, whose aim is to provide ‘a safe, friendly and embracing environment’ for children caught up in conflicts.

"As the 'world’s elite' descend on the small Swiss town of Davos this week for forums aiming to solve “the biggest issues facing our world"", the charity Oxfam have released a report revealing the extreme gap between the world’s wealthiest and poorest people.

The charity said the best-off had pocketed $26tn (£21tn) in new wealth up from the start 2020 to the end of 2021. That represented 63% of the total new wealth, with the rest going to the remaining 99% of people.

The report calls for immediate action to tackle widening global inequality after revealing that while poverty has increased for the first time in 25 years, the combined fortune of billionaires has increased by $2.7bn a day.

“The current economic reality is an affront to basic human values”, says Danny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of Oxfam GB.

“How can we accept a system where the poorest people in many countries pay much higher tax rates than the super-rich? Governments must introduce higher taxes on the super-rich now.""

One of the richest men in history, Elon Musk, has been shown to pay a ‘true tax rate’ of 3.2%, while another of the richest billionaires, Jeff Bezos, pays less than 1%, the report says.

Oxfam said extreme concentrations of wealth led to weaker growth, corrupted politics and the media, corroded democracy and led to political polarisation.

The super-rich were key contributors to the climate crisis, the charity added, with a billionaire emitting a million times more carbon than the average person.

“Taxing the wealthiest is no longer an option – it’s a must"" said Colombia’s finance minister, José Antonio Ocampo in a foreword to the report.

Winslet, who stars as Ruth in the Channel 4 drama, plays a concerned mother who witnesses her teenage daughter Freya becoming consumed with the pressures of social media.

‘To people in power and people who can make change - please criminalise harmful content,’ the actor said.

"While homosexuality remains illegal in Malawi - for few hours over the weekend the streets of the capital Lilongwe were covered in rainbows as about 50 members of the country’s persecuted LBGTQ+ community took part in the country’s first Pride parade.

Marchers donned shirts with rainbow colours and emblazoned with words such as “embracing our queerness”, “pride unites world”, “love first” and “Malawi is for us too”, as they danced and chanted “Viva LGBTI!”.

The risks to those who took part were high as anyone who identifies as anything other than heterosexual faces arrest and imprisonment of of up to 14 years.

But those on the streets on Saturday spoke of their joy that in a year during which events had been cancelled across the world, their parade was at last taking place during annual Pride month.

Andreas, 29, said it was a huge moment for his community as he danced to the music and raised a placard above his head. “I feel so happy to be part of this,” he said.

"A teenager who “stands for the oppressed, and the forgotten” is to become the first LGBTQ+ character to take on the mantle of Captain America.

Marvel Comics is celebrating the 80th anniversary of the US hero with the launch of a new limited series, The United States of Captain America, which will see incumbent Steve Rogers teaming up with former Captain Americas when his shield goes missing.

The heroes will take a road trip across the US to find the shield, and will meet people from “all walks of life” who have taken on the mantle of Captain America to defend their communities. Aaron Fischer, a gay teenager, will be the first, in the new limited series released in June.

Fischer was illustrated by transgender artist Jan Bazaldua, who said; ""As a transgender person, I am happy to be able to present an openly gay person who admires Captain America and fights against evil to help those who are almost invisible to society"".

And writer, Joshua Trujillo, is also excited about the introduction of Fischer; “Aaron is inspired by heroes of the queer community: activists, leaders and everyday folks pushing for a better life. He stands for the oppressed and the forgotten. I hope his debut story resonates with readers and helps inspire the next generation of heroes.”

Marvel reportedly had a “No Gays in the Marvel Universe” policy in the 1980s, under the editor-in-chief Jim Shooter.

But in recent years, Marvel has moved to diversify its cast of superheroes across sexuality, race, and gender.

"""If I close my eyes and think of Stephen Sondheim, I remember him in my kitchen just talking about life, about dogs.""

For our series remembering cultural figures we lost in 2021, British actor Imelda Staunton pays tribute to the great American composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim.

Staunton, who has appeared in productions of Sondheim’s classic musicals Into the Woods, Sweeney Todd, and Gypsy places him in theatre history as: “the last of the big boys, the final link with the great American songbook, a man with personal connections to Oscar Hammerstein and Leonard Bernstein.”

She came to know him as a friend and remembers his generosity with actors, directors and producers and how he always had time for younger cast members.

“He never made you feel inadequate,” she says. “He only ever wanted all of us to be our very best.” She also explains the great gift in his work to a performer: “His work is not about how the songs sound. It’s how they feel… He wrote monologues and then, in the music, he gave you the rhythm and the heartbeat of each one.”

"Serena Williams has confirmed she will retire from tennis after an era-defining career that has seen her win 23 grand slam singles titles.

The 40-year-old broke the news in an article for Vogue published on Tuesday.

“I have never liked the word retirement,” Williams wrote. “Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”

Williams said her decision had been influenced by the desire to expand her family. She gave birth to her first child, Olympia, in 2017.

“I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair,” Williams wrote. “If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.”

In the article, Williams suggested her final tournament will be the US Open, which starts later this month and runs through to the start of September.

Williams and her sister Venus burst on to the tennis scene as teenagers, shaking up what had been a traditionally white sport. 

Between them, they won 30 grand slam singles titles. They also combined to win 14 major doubles titles. Serena won her last grand slam title at the Australian Open in 2017. She has struggled with injuries in recent years and was beaten in the first round of this summer’s Wimbledon by Harmony Tan.

"“This is about celebrating our transness,” says Alex, one of the four soon-to-be parents who have chosen to share their story about what it’s like to carry their future children as a transgender man.

“I think Seahorse Parents [project] is about showcasing the differences that exist among birthing people,” he adds. “It’s about acknowledging that those differences aren’t inherently bad, but, rather, beautiful.”

“Seahorse Parents shows that all parents deserve to create families in whatever ways feel right to them … In addition, participating in this with another pregnant transmasculine person was the most affirming experience I’ve ever had.”

For Liam, another soon-toarent, said the “Seahorse Parents is about putting our stories out into the world. It shows our budding families in the most beautiful light.”

"Former Strictly Come Dancing head judge Len Goodman has died at the age of 78, surrounded by his family, at a hospice in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, UK.

In 2004, he waltzed into living rooms for Strictly's launch and helped turn Saturday-night family TV into a fixture again.

Len was known for his wry humour, memorable catchphrases and awarding ""seveeeeern"" points.

Here are some of Len's best one-liners:

“You floated across that floor like butter on a crumpet,"" Len said to Frankie Bridge and Kevin Clifton for their foxtrot critique in 2014.

“More rise and fall than an auctioneer’s gavel,""
he said to Tim Wonnacott and Natalie Lowe’s for their waltz in 2014. 

""You were like a chess master, you plotted your way around that floor,"" he said to Jay McGuinness and Aliona Vilani for their tango in 2015.

A statement from his manager, Jackie Gill, on Monday said: ""It is with great sadness to announce that Len Goodman has passed away peacefully, aged 78.

""A much loved husband, father and grandfather who will be sorely missed by family, friends and all who knew him.""

"""This is a bittersweet moment"" 

Tennis legend Roger Federer has announced his retirement at the age of 41. The 20-time grand-slam champion made the announcement via a letter posted on social media, having struggled with a knee problem for the last three years.

In the announcement, Federer said: ""Of all the gifts that tennis has given me over the years, the greatest, without a doubt, has been the people I’ve met along the way: my friends, my competitors, and most of all the fans who give the sport its life.""

“As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries. I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form. But I also know my body’s capacities and limits, and its message to me lately has been clear ... Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognise when it is time to end my competitive career.

""The last 24 years on Tour have been an incredible adventure. While it sometimes feels like it went by in 24 hours, it has also been so deep and magical that it seems as if I’ve already lived a full lifetime.”

Federer will play in next week’s Laver Cup in London, the Ryder Cup-style competition that was his brainchild, but then says he will leave the professional game.

"Sir Lee Pearson has triumphed in the Paralympic dressage - claiming the 12th gold medal of his career. After his victory he was asked by a local journalist about Japanese society not widely accepting or supporting LGBTQ+ rights. This is how he replied:

“Love has to prevail, really. Whatever shape or form, I think love has to prevail. If you’re born with a disability, if you have a child with a disability, if you’re born with same-sex attraction, if your daughter comes out or your son, then just love them.

""Nobody wants to be different but we have to embrace different people because that’s society, that’s the world. Those different people they’re not going anywhere. So you can say it’s illegal, you can make them feel awful, but somewhere in the world another gay boy or girl will be born. Somewhere in the world someone will be born with no limbs. Do you know what I mean? Life goes on and it’s silly in this day and age when we have countries that are still in the stone age, as we say, 100 years behind. But I’m just a horse rider. Promise.”

Some horse rider.

In the stifling Tokyo heat, Pearson, on the back of a new partner, Breezer, well, breezed home.

The 47-year-old from Cheddleton, Staffordshire, who was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita which causes muscle weakness and contracture of the joints, is the pre-eminent equestrian athlete in the history of Paralympic sport.

By the time the end of this year’s Games comes along, and Pearson has competed in both the team dressage and the individual freestyle test, he could have more gold medals on his own than Germany and the United States (the second and third most successful countries in Paralympic equestrian sport) do between them.

That he is more than that, an icon of disability sport as well as an openly, confidently gay athlete who performs to a global audience and has been out for decades, makes the man unique.

He is, also, ""just a horse rider"".

"What would your guess have been? 💎

According to extensive research and analysis by the Guardian’s investigations team, King Charles III has inherited assets that have propelled his wealth to almost £2bn.

The monarch’s personal fortune is largely concealed from public scrutiny and it is impossible to know the complete value of his estate.

But, as part of our new series Cost of the Crown, a team of our reporters have conducted the first comprehensive audit of the king’s assets, from country piles and diamond-encrusted jewels, to paintings by Monet and Dalí, Rolls-Royces, racehorses and rare stamps. 

In a statement responding to our investigation the king’s spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on private finances, your figures are a highly creative mix of speculation, assumption and inaccuracy.”

Buckingham Palace declined to offer alternative figures; it has a policy of refusing to comment on the personal finances of royals, insisting they should “remain private, as they do for any other individual”.

The research into the king’s assets, however, reveals quite how different they are from those of any other individual. To read exactly why - and to learn more about what is actually the Windsor family’s most valuable financial asset – tap the link in our bio.

"""We’re just thrilled to have her back home. She is thriving.""  

After noticing Goldie the porcupine pufferfish was losing weight, her owner rushed to the vet in Kent in the southeast of England.

Medics at Sandhole Veterinary Centre in Snodland confirmed five-year-old pufferfish’s teeth were the problem; they were too long for her to eat and needed to be filed down.

So, Goldie was sedated using a water bowl filled with a mild anaesthetic solution and a veterinary surgeon sawed down one inch from her teeth.

To calm Goldie during the procedure, the water was kept well oxygenated. “This meant she was still breathing nicely throughout, but was able to be held for brief periods out of the water without becoming too stressed,” veterinary surgeon, Daniel Calvo Carrasco, said.

Veterinary nurse Debbie Addison also held Goldie in a damp towel to prevent her from drying out – and provide a layer of protection if Goldie’s “puff up” defensive mode is activated. When they feel threatened or distressed, pufferfish can inflate to double their size to deter predators.
 
Carrasco, who specialises in caring for exotic pets, said: “Porcupine pufferfish teeth are known as beaks and grow continuously throughout their lives ... They’re usually kept short naturally, as they’re worn down on their regular diet of hard-shelled foods, but, while these foods are provided in her home environment, she is not as forthcoming in eating them as her other tank mates ... As a result, her upper beak grew to the point where it was hindering her ability to eat effectively.”

Goldie responded very well to the surgery, “there was no stress at all,” said Carrasco. “Within five minutes, she was able to stay upright in the water and within 10 minutes she was back to happily swimming around.""

Goldie is now well settled back home in her tank in Leybourne, much to the relief of her owner, Mark Byatt, who said: “We’re just thrilled to have Goldie back home. She is thriving back in her tank and none the worse for her visit to the dentist.”

"Virgil Abloh, the much-loved, trailblazing founder of Off-White and acclaimed artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear has passed away at the age of 41 after a two-year battle with a rare form of cancer, it was announced this evening. 

A message shared on his Instagram account said: “We are devastated to announce the passing of our beloved Virgil Abloh. He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture.

“Through it all, his work ethic, infinite curiosity, and optimism never wavered. Virgil was driven by his dedication to his craft and to his mission to open doors for others and create pathways for greater equality in art and design. He often said, ‘Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself,’ believing deeply in the power of art to inspire future generations.”

Abloh redefined the idea of the modern fashion designer, adding DJ, artist and furniture designer to his creative arsenal. After training as an architect, he started designing clothes in 2012 - and went on to become the first Black designer at Vuitton and one of the most visible Black designers in fashion. 

Abloh was also a hugely visible figure in rap, designing the album covers for Kanye West, Jay-Z, Pop Smoke, Westside Gunn, Octavian and Lil Uzi Vert.

Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH that owns Louis Vuitton paid tribute to the designer. “We are all shocked by this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer and a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom.”

He is survived by his wife Shannon and his children Lowe and Grey.

"Parrot POV ...

A 'kleptomaniac' parrot swiped a family’s GoPro at Fiordland National Park in New Zealand - capturing some magnificent footage as it took flight with its loot.

Aotearoa’s native alpine parrot species, the kea, is known for its curious and mischievous nature – and for swiping wallets, jewellery, packed lunches, windscreen wipers and other valuables from unsuspecting tourists and visitors.

Alexandra Verheul, from Dunedin, had been hiking the Kepler Track with her family when the bird seized its opportunity. The device had been set down on a balcony at their hut, and was quickly nabbed by the kea, described by the National Geographic as “a very curious parrot”.

It immediately took flight, all the while filming its glorious getaway. The GoPro captured the airborne escape, as well as the kea’s landing and brief, slightly frenzied attack on the camera.

Verheul told local TV programme Seven Sharp: “We just followed the sound down there ... they’d obviously heard us coming and abandoned the GoPro … My son decided to go check the rocks where it looked like a good place for a bird to land, and there it was still sitting there, still filming.”

"The prospects of the world staying within the 1.5C limit on global heating have brightened owing to the “staggering” growth of renewable energy and green investment in the past two years, the chief of the world’s energy watchdog has said.

The 1.5C limit stems from the Paris agreement, which contains two key goals of limiting global heating to “well below” 2C, while “pursuing efforts” to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, and the world’s foremost energy economist, said much more needed to be done but that the rapid uptake of solar power and electric vehicles were encouraging in meeting this goal.

“Despite the scale of the challenges, I feel more optimistic than I felt two years ago,” he said in an interview. “Clean energy investments in the last two years have seen a staggering 40% increase.”

Due to solar and electric vehicle sales staying “in line with what they should be,” Birol said the world is on track to reach net zero by 2050.

But Birol also noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector were “still stubbornly high”, and that the extreme weather seen around the world this year had shown the climate was already changing “at frightening speed”.

"The number of sculptures that feature animals in London is twice that of named women, a new study has found.

The findings show that out of almost 1,500 monuments in the capital, more than a fifth are dedicated to named men (20.5%), and only 4% are dedicated to named women.

The number of sculptures that feature animals, almost 100, is double that of named women. Just 1% of sculptures are dedicated to named people of colour; 0.9% are men of colour and 0.2% are named women of colour

The study, part of a national research project by Art UK funded in part by City Hall, is the first comprehensive audit of public sculpture and monuments across the capital.

It comes as the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announces details of a £1m fund to ensure the capital's landmarks and monuments better reflect the diversity and the achievements of all who have contributed to the success of the city.

"“I don’t want no government telling me what to do. I’m so happy""

On Tuesday night, scenes of jubilation broke as Kansans secured a huge win for abortion rights in the US when they voted to continue to protect abortion in the state constitution.

Kansas – a deeply conservative and usually reliably Republican state – is the first US state to put abortion rights to a vote since the supreme court ruled to overturn constitutional protections for abortion in late June.

“We’re free!” shouted Mafutari Oneal, 56, who was working at a bar in Kansas City hosting a watch party for the victorious No campaign.

The state will remain a safe haven for abortion in the midwest, as one of the few states in the region where it remains legal to perform the procedure. Many other states have undertaken moves to make abortion largely illegal since June.

"It's time to shatter taboos about physical intimacy among older people.

And that's what this new campaign is trying to do.

Five naked, or nearly naked, couples and a woman have taken part in a photoshoot for 'Let’s Talk the Joy of Later Life Sex' - for the relationships charity Relate and aims to “tackle the stigma around this unspoken subject”.

The intimate photos were captured by Rankin, a globally renowned portrait and fashion photographer, and his images are accompanied by words that challenge stereotypes of sexual desire and activity in later years.

One poster shows a man kissing his partner’s neck, with the words: “Over the hill. And the table. And the sofa.” Another features a woman who has had a double mastectomy, with her partner, and the words: “The years are going up, but you’re still going down.”

Rankin, 55, said the campaign set out to break convention; “The simple fact is, we all need intimacy now more than ever – and age really is just a number. The greatness of love and affection – the very things we can’t stop writing books, films and pop songs about – doesn’t need to change as we find our later years.”

The posters will be displayed on billboards across the UK from this week.

"Robbie Coltrane, whose acting career spanned everything from Bond films to Cracker to Harry Potter, has died aged 72.

Born Anthony Robert McMillan in the prosperous Glaswegian suburb of Rutherglen, Coltrane was educated at Glenalmond College, an independent boarding school whose corporal punishment he described as “legalised violence”, before going to the Glasgow School of Art.

He had second thoughts about his ability as a painter, and switched to live performance, acting in radical theatre companies (including a troupe from San Quentin State prison) and doing standup, taking the pseudonym Coltrane as homage to celebrated jazz musician John Coltrane.

His first screen credit was Waterloo Sunset, the Richard Eyre-directed Play for Today in 1979, in which he played opposite Queenie Watts’s care-home escapee.

Coltrane’s raised status was confirmed by his casting as the criminal psychologist “Fitz” Fitzgerald in Jimmy McGovern’s TV series Cracker, which first aired in 1993. A defiantly non-comic role, Fitzgerald was a groundbreaking creation: brilliant at his job but a mess in his personal life. Coltrane won the best TV actor Bafta in 1994, 1995 and 1996 for the role.

He found himself at the top of the list for the casting of Hogwarts’ school groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid in the film adaptation of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series. The first in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, was released in 2001, and gained Coltrane a new audience of younger fans.

"The vast Zinder region in Niger, west Africa, is the most populated part of the country. Its people are now being profoundly affected by the climate crisis.

Spanish photographer, Luis Tato, took this photograph of a girl in a baobab tree during a 2019 visit while working on stories about the crisis, reforestation and resilience projects.

This girl, who was 10 or 11, has confidently climbed to the very top of the tree, collecting leaves for her family's dinner. Baobab leaves are a popular meal in the region, and the tastiest are usually higher up.

@luistatophoto says he loves the gentle and poetic nature of the image; ""The area has been scarred by conflict and drought but life also goes on in a quiet way. This tree, and what it represents, makes me feel positive and peaceful.""

From tomorrow, most households in Britain will see their energy bills rise by 54% – or almost £700 – to just under £2,000 a year. It will be the biggest rise in living memory ... but may only be the start - and a trend that is mirrored around the world.

So, as energy saving is on many people's minds, we asked experts how we can cut our use down, and hopefully save a bit of money.

"Vegan alternatives to leather could save more than just animals. The scientists behind fashion’s new latest must-have – the “mushroom leather” handbag – believe that mycelium, a material grown from fungi which can be engineered to look and feel like calfskin or sheepskin, could help save the planet.

Speaking to the Guardian before a talk at the Business of Fashion Voices conference in Oxfordshire, Dr Matt Scullin, CEO of biomaterials company MycoWorks, forecast that mushroom leather could be a sustainability gamechanger, “unlocking a future of design which begins with the material, not with the object”.

Fine Mycelium, a patented material which can be grown from fungi in trays in a matter of weeks, replicates the appearance and feel of leather while outperforming it in strength and durability. The material recently made its high fashion debut as an exclusive Hermès handbag.

“It can give the same emotional response as an animal leather. It has that hand-feel of rarity,” says Scullin. On a planet of finite natural resources, Scullin believes both the technology and the mindset of carbon-neutral, grown-to-order mushroom leather could be “revolutionary” – and have implications for innovation in manufacture beyond fashion.

"Emma Raducanu’s gloriously unexpected Wimbledon adventure ended in sadness last night as she was forced to retire from her fourth round match after she started to breathe heavily and feel dizzy on court.⁣
⁣
In a statement on Twitter, the 18-year-old said that the ""whole experience caught up"" with her but she is now ""feeling better"". She congratulated her opponent Ajla Tomljanović, who advanced to the quarter-finals.⁣

@emmaraducanu added that not being able to carry on was ""the hardest thing in the world"", but that she was advised by medics not to continue. She also went on to thank everyone who has been cheering her on during her remarkable run at SW19.

Having only made her WTA Tour debut in June, Raducanu caused a sensation during the championships, becoming the youngest British player in the open era to reach the last 16 - beating two top-50 players along the way. She began the tournament ranked 338 in the world and will now rise to a career high of 175.

"‣ UK's first prime minister of colour
‣ First Hindu prime minister
‣ Youngest PM since 1812
‣ And the richest British PM in history

Some big firsts have been hit by Rishi Sunak's elevation to UK prime minister, and there have been a swell of responses online to Sunak's unprecedented wealth. This is first time in history that the occupants of No 10 Downing Street will be richer than the monarch in Buckingham Palace.

Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, are sitting on a combined fortune of about £730m – roughly double the estimated £300m-£350m wealth of King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort.

Earlier this year, the 42-year-old became the first frontline politician to ever be included in the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s wealthiest people.

At at a time when millions of Britons are struggling with a cost of living crisis, what do you think of the country's leader being so wealthy?

"Ellie Cole has won six gold medals. Yet as other women athletes, or sportspeople of colour, or other minorities can attest, success is no shield sometimes.

“You know, six years ago, I was working at a place and I was told that I was a ‘diversity hire,’” she told @guardian_australia from a training camp in Cairns.

The star swimmer believes the comment was made in jest. But she was disappointed. “And I think that’s when I really started asking myself questions about what’s happening outside of the sporting space,” she says. “Because as a prolific athlete, I do live in a bit of a bubble. What’s actually happening out there in the real world needs to be spoken about more.""

Today, the International Paralympic Committee – along with dozens of other major organisations – are launching @WeThe15, which they hope to be the world’s largest human rights movement. The 15 refers to the estimated 15% of people across the globe who have a disability.

The goal of the 10-year campaign, which will be a key feature of the Paralympics Opening ceremony on 24 August, is to “act as a global movement publicly campaigning for disability visibility, accessibility, and inclusion”. Its main message is that: people with disabilities don’t need your pity, they deserve your respect.

When @elliecoleswim was asked by the IPC to take part in the campaign, she thought of her parents. “When they were told that I was going to have my leg amputated at three … their first response was that they felt this overwhelming sense of fear about what my future was going to be like,” Cole says. “They didn’t know anyone else who had a disability.”

As a child, Cole’s parents enrolled her in swimming to help with her rehabilitation. This week, at 29-years-old, she will jet off to Tokyo for her fourth @paralympics.

Cole is the reigning champion in the 100m backstroke S9 and has 15 Paralympic medals to her name – six of them gold.

"'Truth matters'

Fox News and the voting equipment company Dominion have reached a $787.5m settlement, ending a dispute over whether Fox knowingly broadcast false and outlandish allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election.

Though the case was settled, Dominion had unearthed a stunning trove of internal communications from Fox laying bare how top talent and hosts knew the outlandish claims about Dominion and a stolen election were false. 

The extensive messages offered a remarkable insight into how some of the most powerful hosts in America did not buy the allegations they were broadcasting to their audience each night.

Neither party immediately disclosed the terms of the settlement other than the dollar amount, and attorneys for Dominion declined to answer questions about whether it requires Fox to issue a retraction or a formal apology.

In a press conference outside the courthouse, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said the more than $787m represents “vindication and accountability”.

“Truth matters,” he said. “Lies have consequences. The truth does not know red or blue,” he continued. “People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues, even of the most profound importance. But for our democracy to endure another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.”

In a statement, Fox said the settlement reflects its “continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards”.

“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said.

"Who ate all the salmon?

Twelve bulging bears battled it out to take home the illustrious title of Alaska’s fattest bear.

Thousands cast their vote in the annual competition which compares the pre-hibernation weight gain of the Katmai national park residents.

Master-of-salmon and reigning champion Otis took the crown this year, with a charming underdog backstory that ultimately won over bear enthusiasts.

Pre-hibernation weight gain over Alaska’s short summer and fall is crucial for bears heading into the long, freezing winter. Gorging on salmon during this time allows the bears to emerge healthy from hibernation when spring comes around.

"The BBC’s preschool TV channel CBeebies has appointed George Webster as its first presenter with Down’s Syndrome. 

The 20-year-old actor, dancer and ambassador for the disability charity Mencap, was announced as a presenter on Monday. 

In a video posted on social media, Webster said: “I feel so proud and I’m feeling so excited to start”, adding that he was looking forward to cooking and dancing in his new role.

Mencap described him as “a brilliant role model”.

Webster, who is from Leeds, previously appeared in an educational video for the BBC’s Bitesize strand on misconceptions around the genetic condition.

CBeebies, aimed at children under seven, has been praised for its diverse content in recent years. 

Reactions to Webster’s appointment contrasts with the reception some 12 years ago to then-Cbeebies presenter Cerrie Burnell, born with her lower right arm missing, and whose appearance on the channel in 2009 led to a barrage of complaints.

Burnell Tweeted the news about Webster’s appointment, with the words “absolute joy”, as well as retweeting another message which posited that perhaps “the world has turned” in the intervening years.

"From orangutans swinging through psychedelic forests, to deer roaming saturated canyons - artist Jim Naughten hopes to draw attention to nature's rapid disappearance and our growing estrangement with it.

For his latest exhibition, he has combined photography and painting to create images of the natural world as a faraway fictional fantasy.

Naughten drew inspiration from dioramas of animal forms found in natural history museums all over the world, before digitally reimagining them in defamiliarised and unrealistic contexts.

His digital painting technique is closely linked to magic realism, in which the boundary between fact and fiction, imagination and reality, becomes blurred through the intersection of mediums.

""I’m interested in how, in the evolutionary blink of an eye, humans have come to dominate and overwhelm the planet and how far our relationship with the natural world has fundamentally and dangerously shifted from that of our ancestors.""

""I hope the work will create awareness and discourse about this disconnection, our fictionalised ideas about nature and possibilities for positive change.""

"71% of boys feared they teased if they played with what they described as “girls’ toys”, according to a new survey by Lego.

It has prompted the world's largest toymaker to confirm it will remove gender stereotypes from its products.

The company surveyed almost 7,000 parents and children aged six to 14 from China, the Czech Republic, Japan, Poland, Russia, UK and the US.

It found attitudes to play and future careers remain unequal and restrictive.

The survey showed that, while girls were becoming more confident and keen to engage in a wide range of activities, almost third quarters of boys who took part feared they would be made fun of if they played with what they described as “girls’ toys” – a fear shared by their parents.

The study found that parents still encouraged sons to do sports or Stem activities, while daughters were offered dance and dressing up (girls were five times more likely to be encouraged in these activities than boys) or baking (three times more likely to be encouraged).

Madeline Di Nonno, the chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, who conducted the research, said this showed behaviours associated with men are valued more highly in society; ""Until societies recognise that behaviours and activities typically associated with women are as valuable or important, parents and children will be tentative to embrace them.”

The Danish toymaker said it no longer labels any of its products “for girls” or “for boys” and customers can no longer search for products by gender online. Instead, the Lego website offers themes that it calls “passion points”.

"Onsite drug testing facilities at music festivals “encourage people to not play Russian roulette with their lives”, argues journalist Daisy Jones, who says it helps some festival-goers make “safe, informed choices”.

With hundreds of thousands of people descending on events this summer, the Home Office has been accused by leading festival organisers, artists and MPs of endangering the lives of festival-goers after effectively blocking on-site drug testing this month by requiring festivals to apply for a special licence.

Volunteer-run drug-testing facilities such as The Loop operate from festivals to provide a safe space for advice, test drugs to check for substances that may put people at a greater level of risk and put out warnings if dangerous substances are found.

Blocking these organisations from festival sites is risky, and just another example of the UK government’s “puritanical” approach to drug safety which isn’t prioritising the facts, says Jones.

"‘If I am destined to sacrifice myself for the love of my homeland, I will gladly accept it’

In July, Finn Lau, a pro-democracy activist from Hong Kong living in exile in London, woke up to urgent messages from friends.

Finn was told that he and seven other overseas activists had HK$1m bounties out for their arrest. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said these dissidents would be pursued ‘to the ends of the Earth’. 

Just days after the announcement, officers began showing up at the homes of many of the activists' families in Hong Kong, taking away parents, siblings, children and in-laws for questioning.

Finn said he was not surprised.

In 2019, he was a leading figure in Hong Kong’s mass protests, where an estimated quarter of the region’s population took to the streets against what they described as an erosion of Hong Kong’s freedom from Beijing control. 

For years, he has been wanted by Hong Kong police.

Now, faced with what he says is increased international oppression from China, even in the UK, Finn no longer feels safe.

"Down in the ocean's shadowy depths, this fish gazes up towards the surface through its transparent head with eyes like mesmerising emerald orbs ...

These domes are huge spherical lenses that sit on a pair of long, silvery eye tubes – hence its common name, the barreleye fish.

The green tint of this fish’s eyes acts almost like sunglasses, helping it track down its prey in the ocean water above it.

With nowhere to hide in the open waters of the deep ocean, many animals living there have glowing bellies that help erase their shadow - bioluminescent prey are hard to spot against the dim blue sunlight trickling down. But barreleyes are one step ahead.

Their eye pigment allows the fish to distinguish between sunlight and bioluminescence, says Bruce Robison, deep-sea biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.

While they appear to constantly be looking up, barrel-eye fish can also rotate their eyes to track their prey through the water until they’re right in front of their mouths.

So, how easy is it to encounter barreleyes in the wild? Unsurprisingly, not very.

"They say that grandchildren are life’s greatest joy, and now the first study to examine grandmothers’ brain function has suggested they may be more emotionally connected to their grandkids than to their offspring.

The research, led by Prof James Rilling, an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, recruited 50 women with at least one grandchild aged between three and 12, and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan their brains as they looked at photos of that child, the child’s parents, and images of an unrelated child and adult.

“What really jumps out is the activation in areas of the brain associated with emotional empathy,” Rilling said. “That suggests that grandmothers are geared toward feeling what their grandchildren are feeling when they interact with them. If their grandchild is smiling, they’re feeling the child’s joy. And if their grandchild is crying, they’re feeling the child’s pain and distress.”

In contrast, when the grandmothers looked at images of their adult child, slightly different brain areas tended to be activated: those associated with cognitive empathy. This could indicate that they were trying to cognitively understand their adult child, rather than experiencing a more direct emotional connection.

Rilling believes this could possibly help to explain the experience many grown-up children have of their parents often seeming more excited to see their grandchildren than them.

“Young children have likely evolved traits to be able to manipulate not just the maternal brain, but the grand-maternal brain. An adult child doesn’t have the same cute factor, so they may not the same emotional response.”

The findings, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, support the idea that there may be a global caregiving system in the brain that is activated in mothers (who have been examined in separate studies), fathers and grandmothers. Rilling now hopes to study grandfathers and other childcare providers to see how they compare.

"The owner of the Guardian, the Scott Trust, has issued an apology for the role the newspaper’s founders had in transatlantic slavery and announced a decade-long programme of restorative justice. 

“The Scott Trust is deeply sorry for the role John Edward Taylor and his backers played in the slavery economy. We recognise that apologising and sharing these facts transparently is only the first step in addressing the Guardian’s historical links to transatlantic slavery, which was a crime against humanity,"" said Ole Jacob Sunde, chair of the Scott Trust which owns the Guardian.

“In response to the findings, the Scott Trust is committing to fund a restorative justice programme over the next decade, which will be designed and carried out in consultation with descendant communities in the US, Jamaica, the UK and elsewhere, centred on long-term initiatives and meaningful impact.

“These are significant new facts about the Guardian’s origin story, and they must therefore inform our purpose as we move forward, pushing us to do more to reflect the society we aspire to, alongside the radical history of Peterloo which originally inspired our values and our mission.”

The Scott Trust said it expected to invest more than £10m (US$12.3m, A$18.4m), with millions dedicated specifically to descendant communities linked to the Guardian’s 19th-century founders.

"“I feel incredibly proud to say that I am a gay man and also an Olympic champion. When I was younger I didn’t think I’d ever achieve anything because of who I was. To be an Olympic champion now just shows that you can achieve anything,"" Tom Daley said after winning Olympic gold with his diving partner Matty Lee for Great Britain.

Daley and Lee had produced a stunning performance in the synchronised 10m platform to take the gold medal by one point ahead of the Chinese pair Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen.

For Daley this was also a very public moment of fulfilment after bronze medals in London and Rio, a period that has coincided with marriage to the film producer Dustin Lance Black and the birth of their son, Robbie.

In the glow of victory, Daley spoke with startling clarity about the pressures he has faced in the course of a life lived in the public spotlight.

""There are more openly out athletes at these Olympic Games than any Olympic Games previously. I came out in 2013 and when I was younger I always felt like the one that was alone and different and didn’t fit ... I hope that any young LGBT person out there can see that no matter how alone you feel right now, you are not alone.”

Daley and Lee had produced a stunning performance in the synchronised 10m platform to take the gold medal by one point ahead of the Chinese pair Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen

For Daley this was also a very public moment of fulfilment after bronze medals in London and Rio a period that has coincided with marriage to the film producer Dustin Lance Black and the birth of their son Robbie

In the glow of victory Daley spoke with startling clarity about the pressures he has faced in the course of a life lived in the public spotlight

There are more openly out athletes at these Olympic Games than any Olympic Games previously I came out in 2013 and when I was younger I always felt like the one that was alone and different and didnt fit  I hope that any young LGBT person out there can see that no matter how alone you feel right now you are not alone

"What a moment. A bawling Coco Gauff collapsed on the court after beating Aryna Sabalenka 2-6 6-3 6-2 to win the US Open and claim her first grand slam title. 

With the victory, sixth seed Gauff, 19, became the first American to win a US Open singles title since Sloane Stephens in 2017.

“Honestly, thank you to the people who didn’t believe in me,"" the teenager said after her triumph in Flushing Meadows. 

""A month ago I won a 500 title and people said I’d stop at that. Two weeks ago I won a 1000 title and people said that was as big as it would get. Three weeks later, I’m here with this trophy right now.” 🏆

"In 13 US states, abortion is banned in the earliest stages of pregnancy. But we rarely see what such tissue looks like. 

In the earlier stages of the pandemic when some states tried to deem abortion as “non-essential” medical care, the MYA Network, a network of clinicians and activists came together to show us what tissue in the first nine weeks of pregnancy actually looks like. 

The photos show the early pregnancy tissue removed at four weeks through to what's removed at nine weeks.

At four weeks Dr Joan Fleischman, part of the MYA Network, uses a gentle handheld device that removes the tissue. This more delicate type of extraction keeps it intact.

The final slide shows the gestational sac of the pregnancy at nine weeks. This is everything that would be removed during an abortion and includes the nascent embryo, which is not easily discernible to the naked eye.

Sometimes, patients want to see the tissue after an abortion. “They are stunned by what it actually looks like,” says Dr Fleischman. “That’s when I realized how much the imagery on the internet and on placards – showing human-like qualities at this early stage of development – has really permeated the culture. People almost don’t believe this is what comes out.”

"""You are capable of anything you want.""

Preet Chandi, thought to be the first woman of colour to complete a solo crossing on Antarctica, has finished her expedition to the south pole almost a week ahead of schedule.

Chandi or “Polar Preet”, endured temperatures of -50C as she skied 700 miles across Antarctica in 40 days, seven hours and three minutes, narrowly missing out on setting a new world record by a woman for the trek.

She finished just behind the time set by Johanna Davidsson of Sweden, who finished in 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes in 2016.

Chandi, 32, is now the third-fastest female solo skier for the expedition behind Davidsson and Britain’s Hannah McKeand, who recorded a time of 39 days, nine hours and 33 minutes in 2006.

She is also the first person to reach the south pole on foot in two years.

Chandi, a British Army physiotherapist who lives in Derby, said she hoped her journey would inspire young people, women and those from minority-ethnic backgrounds. Speaking to the Guardian during her training for the trek, she said people did not expect an Asian woman to attempt such an endeavour.

“I am an Asian woman; I’m not the image that people expect to see out there,” she said. “People say the outdoors is for everyone and yes, it is. But if you come from a community that is not involved in it at all, or you don’t see anybody that looks like you doing it, it can be really hard.”

After completing the trek, she plans to set up an adventure grant to help more women fund expeditions in what is often a male-dominated arena.

“I have been told ‘no’ on many occasions and to ‘just do the normal thing’, but we create our own normal,” she said. “You are capable of anything you want.”",2022-01-06 10:00:07,"You are capable of anything you want

"What do you want to see in the future of women's football?

The last time any England football team won a major international tournament was in 1966. That was at a time when women were banned from playing competitively in any form.

Last night, it was England's women's team who took the country all the way and brought the silverware home.

As Guardian sportswriter Jonathan Liew writes: ""Now, against the same opponents in the same stadium, English football – all of it, not just half – has ascended to the very top step of the podium.""

He continues: ""As England celebrated, the tableau that greeted us at Wembley would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. Women commentating on television. Women tapping away in the press box. Women officiating, women coaching on the touchline, women bellowing in the stands. Over the last few weeks these sights have become normalised because they are, in fact, normal. The crowds will disperse. The wall of noise will dissolve. But this legacy will remain: a nation slowly being rewired to expect different, to expect better.

""Here was a simple and unremarkable vision of what sport can be, which also acted as a rueful and wistful vision of what sport could have been all these years had the game’s administrators and custodians valued women beyond their ability to bear children and serve tea.""

"The photojournalist, Steve Schapiro, who died last weekend aged 87, produced some of the most eye catching images of the 1960s.

Born in New York in 1934, Schapiro discovered photography while at summer camp at the age of nine. He started out as a freelance photographer in 1961 - and his images went on to feature on the covers of popular magazines like Life, Look, Time, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Sports Illustrated, People and Paris Match.

The activist, documentarian and artist’s work includes documenting the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1968.

He also produced posters for movies and collaborating with both Barbara Streisand and David Bowie for record covers.

"Mamma Mia, here we go again ...

One of the most anticipated comebacks in pop culture has finally come to pass: the return of Abba.

Forty years after the bitter songs written in the wake of two band divorces for their last album, The Visitors, the Swedish pop quartet have reunited.

New album, Voyage, includes brand new songs that will be released on 5 November – including, they say, a Christmas song.

Two tracks from it, the stately and epic ballad I Still Have Faith in You and the shimmying Don’t Shut Me Down, are out now.

The group – Benny Andersson, Agnetha Fältskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Björn Ulvaeus – have also announced a new concert experience in London, also called Voyage, beginning in May 2022.

Digital versions of themselves (not holograms, their team asserted) will appear nightly alongside a 10-piece live band at a new 3,000-capacity venue in the city’s Olympic park, called the Abba Arena.

Lyngstad said of their reunion: “Such joy it was to work with the group again – I am so happy with what we have made,” and called Andersson and Ulvaeus “exceptionally talented, truly genius songwriters”.

Andersson added: “We’re truly sailing in uncharted waters. With the help of our younger selves, we travel into the future.”

"Just days after a heartbreaking defeat, Lewis Hamilton is now Sir Lewis Hamilton. The Formula One driver was knighted by Prince Charles in Windsor today in recognition of his glittering career.

Over the weekend, he controversially finished second at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - missing out on a record eighth drivers’ crown by the narrowest of margins – but no driver in history has won more races than him.

@lewishamilton was included in the new year honours list following a record-breaking 2020 in which he eclipsed Michael Schumacher’s all-time victory tally and emulated the German by winning a seventh world title.

The 36-year-old becomes the fourth grand prix driver ever to receive this honour – following in the footsteps of Sir Jack Brabham, Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart - and is the first to be awarded a knighthood while still competing.

Hamilton will undoubtedly go down as one of the greats in motor racing, but, as important, he has transcended his sport and used his fame to back the social and political causes he believes in.

The British driver says the death of George Floyd last year awakened his sense of social justice. “I was in tears and this stuff came up that I’d suppressed over all these years,"" he said speaking to @garyyounge in July.

""It was so powerful and sad and also releasing. I thought: 'I can’t stay quiet.' When I did speak out, that was me letting the black community know: 'I hear you and I stand with you.'""

Hamilton has taken the knee before races, worn T-shirts supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and persuaded other drivers to join his protests. Hamilton has funded an investigation into the lack of diversity within motorsport, has also worn a rainbow helmet in countries that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, and has spoken out against human rights abuses in countries that have hosted grands prix.

Arise, Sir Lewis.

"British teenager Emma Raducanu is now one step from the ultimate achievement in her sport.

The 18-year-old outclassed Maria Sakkari, the Greek 17th seed, 6-1, 6-4 in the US Open semi-final to become the first qualifier, man or woman, to reach a grand slam final in the Open era.

She is also the first British woman to reach a grand slam final since Virginia Wade’s triumph at Wimbledon in 1977.

When asked to describe her run to the championship match after only making her major debut earlier this year at Wimbledon, Raducanu said she was still coming to terms with her fairytale run: “A surprise. Honestly I just can’t believe it. A shock. Crazy. All of the above.""

“Is there any expectation? I’m a qualifier so technically, on paper, there’s nothing. No pressure on me,” said Raducanu on court after her victory.

She will face another teenager, 19 year-old Leylah Annie Fernandez in the US Open final this weekend, after the Canadian extended her own astonishing run after previously upsetting both Naomi Osaka, the defending champion, and former champion Angelique Kerber.

With her victory, Fernandez became the youngest woman to reach a grand slam final since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004. Less than two hours later, Raducanu took the record for herself.

"Statues of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and John Lewis have been unveiled in New York City.

They are part of a public art display inspired by the events of 2020 which empowered many to take a stand in demanding justice, as Congressman John Lewis once did.

@confront.art, which connects artists to social justice causes, has created the exhibition in Union Square. The three sculptures, by artist @chriscarnabuci, aim to 'bridge monuments with a movement' according to the organisation.

Proceeds from this installation go towards We Are Floyd, the Breonna Taylor Foundation, and Congressman John Lewis' Foundation and The John and Lillian Miles Lewis Foundation.

According to AMNY, Terrence Floyd said in a speech at the unveiling: “Let’s just take a deep breath. What I’m actually doing for my brother, because he’s no longer able to do it. He didn’t get a chance to do it. And that’s what everyone has to understand, and I want you to know is, don’t waste your breath. Every, every breath you breathe. Don’t waste it.""

“We’re going to do this and love, peace and unity, and we’re going to keep healing together,” he continued.

"In about a third of the time people typically spend looking for something to watch on Netflix, we can build our core muscles, increase hip flexibility and stave off the effects of sitting at our desk all day ...

Even in our hybrid-working world, it can feel like carving out just 30 minutes a couple of times a week is an impossible ask. But everyone has five minutes, right?

And while it might not seem like much, experts say if we keep our efforts focused, we will start to see results – as well as building the foundations of a longer-term habit.

So from mobility to posture: pick an area to work on and get the timer going.

"Hundreds of macaques, also known as long-tailed monkeys, climbed on people - and stacks of fruit - in Lopburi in central Thailand during its annual Monkey Festival.

The feast, which featured two tonnes fruits and vegetables and cost over 100,000 baht ($3,000), is an annual tradition for locals to thank the monkeys for doing their part in drawing in tourists to the town, which is sometimes known as ""Monkey Province.""

""Today's special is durian, which is expensive. Lopburi monkeys like expensive things,"" said Yongyuth Kitwatananusont who has previously organised over 30 monkey festivals.

After a two-year hiatus because of the pandemic, this year's event was committed to give something back to the community, with 100 wheelchairs being donated to those in need.

Covid has badly hit Thailand's tourism industry, but visitors have gradually been returning after the government launched a quarantine-free travel scheme for vaccinated tourists, and the festival proved a popular draw.

"A woman wearing a T-shirt bearing a picture of Mahsa Amini was refused entry to Iran's World Cup match against Wales in Qatar.

The fan's top also had the words 'Women, Life, Freedom' on it – a slogan of the protests in Iran that began after the death of Amini, 22, in police custody in September.

'We have nothing else to wear. What do we wear,' asked the fan as she argued with security today at the Ahmed bin Ali Stadium.

Pointing to the T-shirt, another fan said 'the same exact T-shirt was worn at the last match – the Iran-England match. People wore the same exact T-shirt.'

The fan was also carrying a flag in Iranian colours but not the official national flag. She told Reuters that security later let her into the game after she changed into an official Iran soccer shirt and surrendered the flag.

During the match, which Iran went on to win 2-0, some Iranians carrying a flag with the words ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ were confronted in the stadium by security officials.

A spokesperson for the organising supreme committee said Fifa rules prohibited items with “political, offensive, or discriminatory messages”.

"“That I could come home and hug my wife and hug my son and just tell them how much I love them, it’s a wonderful thing”.

Cesar Franco contracted coronavirus this time last year.

He was not vaccinated at the time and spent five months in hospital on the NHS’ highest level of life support, an Ecmo machine which effectively breathed for him.

For the first nearly two months, he was unable to see his family because of pandemic restrictions.

""Without the teams from the NHS in the hospitals, I would not have been able to survive,"" says Franco, who is the first person in the UK to undergo a double lung transplant as a result of a Covid-19 infection.

"Japan’s Momiji Nishiya became the second youngest champion in summer Olympics history, aged 13 years and 330 days, by winning the inaugural women’s skateboarding street competition.

Nishiya took the lead with her penultimate trick in the event, which is held over a series of stairs, rails and ramps designed to resemble a park, scoring 15.26.

Another 13-year-old, Rayssa Leal of Brazil, won the silver medal. Together with 16-year-old Funa Nakayama of Japan, who won bronze, they made the youngest podium in Olympic history.

Only Marjorie Gestring, who was 13 years and 268 days when claiming diving gold in the women’s 3m springboard at the 1936 Berlin Games, has won gold in a summer Olympics at a younger age.

“I didn’t think I could win, but everyone around me cheered me on so I’m glad I was able to find my groove,” said Nishiya.

"One can only assume Hideki Matsuyama did not feel the heavy burden of history as he made his way around the fairway of Augusta National on Sunday. There is no other reasonable explanation for the manner in which the 29-year-old won the 85th edition of the Masters.

With his final putt, Matsuyama secured a one-shot victory over Will Zalatoris to become the first Asian-born player to don the famed Green Jacket and the only Japanese male to win a major. Two women from Japan have also won majors: Hisako Higuchi at the 1977 LPGA Championship and Hinako Shibuno at the 2019 Women’s British Open.

A shellshocked Matsuyama, who has never been entirely comfortable with the huge media attention he receives in Japan, recognised that his victory could boost golf in a country that has struggled to match its love of the sport with major winners.

Matsuyama’s victory is also a much-needed feelgood story as Tokyo prepares to host an Olympics dogged by scandal and concerns about safety amid the coronavirus pandemic.

"Does this stat change your mind about bottled tap water?

Scientists in Barcelona have found the impact of bottled water on natural resources is 3,500 times higher than for tap water.

The research is the first of its kind and examined the impact of bottled water in the Spanish city, where it is becoming increasingly popular despite improvements to the quality of tap water in recent years.

Research led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) found that if the city’s population were all to drink bottled water, this would result in a 3,500 times higher cost of resource extraction than if they all drank tap water, at $83.9m (£60.3m) a year.

Researchers also found the impact of bottled water on ecosystems is 1,400 times higher than tap water.

The lead author of the study, Cristina Villanueva, said: “Health reasons don’t justify the wide use of bottled water. Yes, strictly speaking, drinking tap water is worse for local health, but when you weigh both, what you gain from drinking bottled water is minimal. It’s quite obvious that the environmental impacts of bottled water are higher compared to tap water.”

In the US, 17m barrels of oil are needed to produce the plastic to meet annual bottled water demand. Villanueva said people trusted bottled water because advertisers have done a good job of convincing people. ""So we need the effort on the other side.”

"Is anyone else getting Finding Nemo vibes?

These fish were captured on camera moving through the sea in the shape of a perfect love heart - slightly reminiscent of the moonfish in the Pixar film that make a series of shapes to talk with Marvin the clownfish.

The school of Crevalle Jack - captured on drone by local restaurant owner Paul Dabill earlier this month - reflect the sunlight as they swirl from a heart to a loop just off Juno Beach in Florida.

""It was a special and beautiful moment before it continued morphing into other amazing shapes,"" Dabill said.

"Artificial intelligence claiming to be able to read emotions is a multi-billion-dollar industry - and it's only growing. Off-the-shelf versions of it can currently be bought from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon.

It is being used on students to monitor engagement in lessons, in marketing to sense enjoyment, and there are reports that China is using it on Uyghur Muslims in the region of Xinjiang.

Luke Stark (@thestarkcontrast), a @westernuniversity assistant professor and researcher into the ethical and social impacts of artificial intelligence, explains how the technology is already being used, exactly how it works, and how worried we should be.

"Halima Aden, the trailblazing Somali-American modest fashion model who quit last year, has said she felt like one of the “biggest tokens” in the fashion industry.

Before she announced her departure last November, the model had made a name for herself by scoring many industry firsts.

In 2017, @halima was the first model to wear a hijab on the cover of a US magazine, Allure; she was the first to wear the head covering on the cover of British Vogue a year later; and, in 2019, the first to wear a burkini on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

Now, Aden says she felt she had to compromise to fit into the industry. “Despite me saying, ‘Don’t change yourself, change the game,’ that was exactly what I was doing,” she told the Times.

“I’m not saying it’s not right for other Muslim, hijab-wearing women, I’m saying it was not right for me. I wear a hijab, I’m a Muslim, I’m Somali, so yes, all these identities set me up to be the perfect token to check all the boxes. I felt like one of the biggest tokens in the industry. I always felt like an outsider in my own career.”

In July, she spoke of the “internal conflict” she felt in the last two years of her career. “My hijab kept shrinking and got smaller and smaller with each shoot,” she told the BBC.

The former model also spoke about a “horrendous” magazine cover that made her look like a “white man’s fetishised version of me”. She didn’t name the publication.

Last week, she announced her return to the fashion industry, not as a model but as a designer. Aden signed a two-year contract with the modest fashion label Modanisa, and her first designs for Halima X Modanisa include headscarves. In a statement, she said: “[Modanisa] shares my faith and values, and fully respects my choices as a Muslim woman.”

"It is almost a year to the day that Venezuelan couple Haydée and Juan Carlos Rodríguez first spotted an injured sloth lying by the side of the road. Trying to cross from one tree to another, the animal had climbed on to a high-voltage power line and been electrocuted.

The animal had lost the claws on three of its paws because of burns and the Rodríguezes were told by a local wildlife expert that it was not likely to survive, and that they should leave it to die.

Today, the sloth is not only thriving but has proved the inspiration for the couple to create what they believe to be Venezuela’s first dedicated sloth rescue and rehabilitation centre.

“We [humans] have invaded their space. When they can’t move from tree to tree, they get confused and climb on to power lines. That’s how they meet their death,” Haydée says.

In the last five months, Juan Carlos and Haydée have rescued 41 sloths, and returned 36 of them to the lush greenery where they are often found.

Their work is vital considering the state of wildlife rehabilitation and conservation in the country, which has been underfunded for years.

Venezuela is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world, its rich ecosystems have been eroded by gold mining and other industrial activities.

"‘Learning Life'

That's the title of the first photograph in this gallery of images from the 2022 Drone photo awards.

The picture - which was taken in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Circle, by French photographer @florian_ledoux_photographer, was a runner up in the competition. ""A young polar bear, a yearling, is playing in the water, testing the fresh ice and jumping back and forth with his sibling, while their mother is resting nearby,"" said Ledoux, describing the image.

""This image is the result of five months in the field, living with and near the bears in a remote camp on the east coast of Svalbard,"" he added.

The overall winner by @armandsphotographie – on the second slide – shows a secondary fissure a few hundred metres from the main crater of the Fagradalsfjall volcano in Iceland. The photograph is titled Big Bang.

Works by the winning photographers will be exhibited in November in Italy at the @sienawards festival.

"""I did it for me.""

Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast of all time, ended her Olympics with a bronze medal - but after a week in Tokyo it felt like a victory.

The four-time Olympic champion pulled out of the team final due to mental health concerns then also withdrew from the all-around, floor and uneven bars, but her bronze in the beam today tied her with Shannon Miller for the most by a US gymnast at the Olympics on seven.

“It wasn’t easy pulling out of all those competitions,” Biles said after clinching bronze. “People just thought it was easy, but I physically and mentally was not in the right head space and I didn’t want to jeopardize my health and my safety because at the end of the day, it’s not worth it.

Biles added that she is grateful to have had the opportunity to bring the topic of mental health to the fore.

“I think it should be talked about a lot more, especially with athletes, because I know some of us are going through the same things and we’re always told to push through it,” she said. “But we’re all a little bit older now and we can kind of speak for ourselves. At the end of the day, we’re not just entertainment, we’re humans and there are things going on behind the scenes that we’re also trying to juggle with as well on top of sports.”

"The Democratic incumbent, Raphael Warnock, has won the Georgia Senate runoff, securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his party’s majority in the chamber.

The Associated Press called the race about three and a half hours after polls closed in Georgia.

The news came a month after the national midterm elections, when neither Walker or Warnock secured enough support to win outright, thus requiring the runoff race.

The result of the runoff did not determine control of the Senate, as Democrats have already won enough seats to maintain their hold for the next two years.

But Warnock’s victory gives Democrats a crucial 51st seat, allowing them to abandon their current power-sharing agreement with Republicans in the evenly divided chamber. A 51-seat majority will also provide Democrats with some wriggle room when it comes to close committee votes and nomination fights.

Nearly 2 million Georgians cast ballots in the runoff before election day, and those early voters appeared to significantly favor Warnock. Republicans were counting on a strong election day turnout, but Walker’s support on Tuesday was not enough to get him across the line.",2022-12-07 05:37:12,"The Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock has won the Georgia Senate runoff securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his partys majority in the chamber

"Which of these doppelgängers do you think look the most alike?

Photographed by @francoisbrunelle.doubles, these lookalikes are not related, but look strikingly like each other.

But why are they so captivating and also confusing to look at?

“It’s the differences that destabilise you – the same but different variations of nostril and ear, which cause that familiar psychic wobble,” writes the Observer’s Eva Wiseman. You really feel it when looking at the work of the Canadian artist.

He was inspired to find and photograph more than 200 pairs of unrelated doppelgängers after being regularly told he looked like Rowan Atkinson … you can swipe to the last slide to see if you agree!

The picture series, I’m Not a Look-alike!, which took 12 years to put together, features men and women who stare out of the frame in the same way.

When the project went viral, it was brought to the attention of Dr Manel Esteller, a researcher at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, who recruited 32 pairs of Brunelle’s look-alikes to take DNA tests and complete questionnaires about their lives. What was the explanation for these doppelgängers, he wondered? What were we seeing? He found that the 16 pairs who were “true” lookalikes, according to facial-recognition software, shared significantly more genes than the others that the software deemed less similar.

“Now there are so many people in the world,” Dr Esteller explained to the New York Times, “the system is repeating itself.”

“Not only are apps that can find our doppelgängers multiplying, the population is multiplying, too, at a pace which means we are all more likely to have one. I just… don’t want to meet her,” writes Wiseman.

Would you want to meet yours?

"China’s president, Xi Jinping, walked into the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday to open the Communist party summit and lay out his vision for the next five years. 

Xi Jinping celebrated China’s crushing of Hong Kong’s autonomy, and warned Taiwan that the “wheels of history” are turning towards Beijing taking control of the island democracy, as he opened a key Communist party summit.

He sees seizing Taiwan as a key part of his legacy and a requirement for China’s “national rejuvenation”. China will never renounce the option of using force to achieve it, he said, repeating a familiar talking point.

“The wheels of history are rolling on towards reunification and the rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation. Complete reunification must be realised and it can without a doubt be achieved,” Xi said on Sunday, drawing the strongest applause of the speech.

“We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force.”

A major reshuffle will take place in the Chinese Communist party’s top echelon at the 20th party congress in Beijing this week, a twice-a-decade meeting that began in the capital yesterday.

Xi, who scrapped term limits in 2018, is expected to be formally returned to power this week for a precedent-breaking third term. Over 104 minutes his speech gave a foretaste of what is in store for the next half decade.

Here our correspondent in Taiwan, Helen Davidson, talks about some key takeaways from Xi's speech.

"These empowering images by photographer Daniel Jack Lyons explore the queerness and trans experience of marginalised communities in the heart of the Amazon.

@danieljacklyons started his project while working in Casa do Rio, a youth centre in the middle of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, which celebrates and supports the cultural lives of teenagers and young people.

As a member of the LGBTQ+ community himself, Lyons was able to create a safe space for queer and trans youth who were torn between hope and disillusionment, bound by tradition and heritage, struggling to assert their difference within their community.

He offered to take their portraits, allowing them to choose the session’s location and their clothing and pose, so that the work can be considered as a collaboration.

""For all the struggles that come with queerness, there is also this magical aspect, in that, I have a built-in family and community wherever I go.

""I did not set out to only document Indigenous queer and trans people in the Amazon, but it was the trans, non-binary and queer people that I developed the most intimate connections with. There was also a very intense desire among the queer community to be seen.""

"What can you do if you can't hug the newest member of your family?

New parents in Japan have one interim solution ... they have been sending bags of rice that weigh the same as their newborn babies to relatives who are unable to visit them due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The bags come in a wide range of designs, with some shaped like a baby wrapped in a blanket so that loved ones can feel as though they are hugging the new arrival while looking at a picture of their face, which is attached to the front.

The price of the bag increases in parallel with the size of the baby; some firms charge one yen a gram, with a 3.5kg pack priced 3,500 yen (£22.90).

Naruo Ono, the owner of Kome no Zoto Yoshimiya rice shop says they first had the idea about 14 years ago when their own son was born; ""I was thinking about what I could do for relatives who lived far away and couldn’t come and see him. So we decided to make bags of rice that were the same weight and shape as the baby, so relatives could hold them and feel the cuteness.""

Ono has since expanded the product range to include wedding-themed celebration rice bags. The wedding rice bags have ended up becoming even more popular than the birth ones.

“During the pandemic, the demand for them has really increased as people haven’t been able to travel to wedding ceremonies,” added Ono.

"Meet Simba: the kid goat with extraordinarily long ears that has become Pakistan's latest media star.

Simba is living a pampered life in Karachi, where he was born last month with ears that were strikingly long – and have grown to reach 54cm (21in).

Breeder Mohammad Hasan Narejo says he often has to folded Simba's ears over his back to stop the kid goat from standing on them.

Narejo says: “Within 10 to 12 days of his birth he was already appearing in all the national and international media – and won a beauty contest. Within 30 days he became so popular that even a famous personality might take 25 to 30 years to achieve this level of fame.”

He is wary of the attention Simba has attracted – including from rival breeders – and says he is prays to try to fend off any ill will.

His plan is to raise Simba as a stud to promote the image of Pakistan as a top goat-breeding nation.

"From actors to athletes: these famous people are reclaiming their names.

The director of Thandiwe Newton's earliest film dropped the “w” from her acting credit without proper consultation, using her anglicised “nickname” to differentiate her from the film character bearing her real name. She then became established professionally as “Thandie” for the next three decades.

But now Newton felt it was important to professionally restore her original Zulu name. “That’s my name. It’s always been my name. I’m taking back what’s mine,” she said.

Her stand prompted a conversation about the power of names and has inspired others to reclaim theirs. The actor previously known as Tanya Fear tweeted: “My full name is Tanyaradzwa~ which means ‘we have been comforted’, I was named this because I was born the year my grandfather died.”

In 2017 and 2021 respectively, Taulupe Falatau and Uilisi Halaholo, rugby players of Tongan descent, reclaimed their real names from Toby and Willis - anglicised nicknames they were given.

Reclaiming a name is an act of resistance, the educationalist Pranav Patel has said, adding that schools can play a major role.

“If teachers don’t offer that validation, children feel they have to acquiesce and assimilate to make others comfortable, and that becomes the norm,” he said. “So when you ask someone how to say or spell their name, it has an impact. It says to them: your name matters, you matter. It’s simple.”",2021-04-09 22:00:38,"From actors to athletes these famous people are reclaiming their names

"""He was the centre of our world""

Tributes have poured in for music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards who has died aged 31.

Edwards was known for founding media platform SBTV, which helped catapult grime and a wave of new artists to a global audience. He was also a director, author, DJ, entrepreneur and designer, and was awarded an MBE in 2014 – when he was 24 – for his work in music.

Edwards said he started SBTV “on a £20 phone” while he was still at school and grew it into a leading online youth broadcaster. 

The careers of some of the world’s most successful musicians, including Ed Sheeran, Dave and Jessie J, were launched through his platform, which began as a YouTube channel, before they were signed by major labels.

Edwards was born in Luton in 1990 and grew up in Acton, west London. He received a BTec diploma from Ealing College and worked at retail chain Topman to financially support himself while developing SBTV.

When he found success, Edwards undertook extensive philanthropic work, including in mental health and the funding of youth centres.

He worked to break down taboos about men’s mental health, speaking of his own anxiety, and in 2021 launched a project aimed at refurbishing and reopening youth centres.

Rapper AJ Tracey tweeted: “RIP Jamal Edwards, west london legend status.”

Dave added: “Thank you for everything … words cannot explain.”

Bafta-winning actor Adam Deacon said: “... Jamal was one of the nicest, most down to earth and humble men I’ve met in this industry. He always gave me time even when no one else would.”

Edwards was the son of singer and Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards. She said in a statement: ""It is with the deepest heartache that I confirm that my beautiful son Jamal Edwards passed away yesterday morning after a sudden illness. 

""Myself, his sister Tanish and the rest of his family and friends are completely devastated. He was the centre of our world.

""... Jamal was an inspiration to myself and so many. Our love for him lives on, his legacy lives on. Long live Jamal Edwards MBE, MBA, PHD.""

"“There’s loads of things I probably let go thinking about because because I was focused on being an artist,” Mahalia told Chanté Joseph.

The Leicester-born singer-songwriter was signed when she was just 13. She won the 2022 Mobo Award for Best R&B/Soul Act and has made a huge name for herself in the music industry. The star’s not shy of sharing opinions on body image, the hard financial realities of being a musician and the way British R&B is treated.

On the latest episode of Pop Culture, @chantayyjayy catches up with @mahalia to talk about everything from, the reality of getting signed at such a young age, what it’s really like to go on tour and some of the biggest challenges artists can face.

"When a pitch invader held up play during Chelsea’s Champions League clash with Juventus, this is how striker Sam Kerr responded.

The Australia captain dropped her shoulder and ran into the man, knocking him to the ground. 

The boos that had greeted the invader instantly turned to cheers for Kerr, before the man took to his feet and made his way from the pitch with stewards in pursuit, to applause from the stands. 

Kerr’s take down earned her a yellow card – and plenty of praise on social media. Sports reporter, Vince Rugari, joked: ‘It was hard to think of a way Sam Kerr could finish this week that would endear her to Australian fans even more, beyond what she’s achieved on the field. This was the only way.’

"'The sexiest man alive.'

Anthony Fauci, an 80-year-old scientist, doctor and public servant, has become an unlikely cult hero for millions of people during the Covid pandemic.

The US diseases expert has been spoofed by Brad Pitt and lauded as the ‘sexiest man alive’.

Now the pop culture phenomenon is the focus of a documentary, appropriately titled: Fauci.

“At the core of Tony’s popularity is that people intuit that this is a man who is speaking the truth and will not let anything stand in the way,” says John Hoffman, the co-director of a new documentary.

“Tony is the signal amid the noise. People are able to sense that there’s a lot of noise and their ears are trying to find the signal and Tony is the signal.”

"Do you think mask wearing should still be required?

According to a new global study, which is the first of its kind, wearing a mask is the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid, reducing incidence by 53%.

While vaccines are safe and effective and saving lives around the world, experts say most do not confer 100% protection, most countries have not vaccinated everyone, and it is not yet known if jabs will prevent future transmission of emerging coronavirus variants.

Globally, Covid cases exceeded 250 million this month. The virus is still infecting 50 million people worldwide every 90 days due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, with thousands dying each day.

Now a systematic review and meta analysis of non-pharmaceutical interventions has found for the first time that mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing are all effective measures at curbing cases – with mask wearing the most effective.

Researchers say the results highlight the need to continue mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing alongside vaccine programmes.

Mask wearing was adopted by many countries at the start of the pandemic, but nearly two years later many have now dropped some or all their original requirements.

The Dutch government this month decided to re-impose the mandatory wearing of face masks in an effort to slow the latest spike in infections.

"""This is a great day for Irish football.""

The Republic of Ireland women's and men's international football teams have agreed a deal with the FAI to receive equal pay.

Starting with the September World Cup qualifiers, both teams will receive the same match fees for the first time.

England, Brazil, Australia, Norway and New Zealand are the countries that already pay their female and male footballers equally at international level.

The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) said the ""historic"" move was made after talks that included team captains Seamus Coleman and Katie McCabe.

The Republic men's team agreed to reduce their international fees, with the FAI matching their contribution to ensure that the Senior Women's team match fee is increased.

It's a major step forward from the situation four years ago, when the Republic of Ireland women's team threatened to go on strike over playing and pay conditions after accusing the football association of treating them as ""fifth class citizens.""

Katie McCabe said the new deal was a ""huge step forward"" and that they had shown the world ""what can be achieved through unity as we offer male and female international players the same opportunities.""

Men's captain Coleman added that the ""deal is the right one for everyone who plays international football for Ireland"" and that the players were ""delighted to do what we can to ensure that our female international players are treated equally and fairly"".

"Refugees from seven generations have come together to recreate a photograph of the signing of the UN refugee convention to mark the agreement’s 70th anniversary.

The gathering celebrates decades of the UK granting sanctuary to people fleeing for their lives – but also warns that the nation’s duty towards refugees must continue into the future.

The photo, created by coalition campaign Together With Refugees, brings together refugees from a range of conflicts including the Hungarian uprising, Ugandan Asians who fled Idi Amin’s regime and the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans war. In the place of the UN document, they signed an orange heart, a symbol of support for refugees.

The UN refugee convention 1951 formalised the rights of refugees under international law. It means that countries signed up to it have a legal duty to protect those fleeing persecution and serious harm in other countries. A total of 149 countries have signed up to this law, including the UK.

George Szirtes, 72, who took part in the recreation photograph, is a successful writer who arrived in the UK as a refugee in 1956 at eight years old, having fled from Hungary.

He said: “Giving safety to people fleeing war and persecution was necessary 70 years ago and I suspect it is more necessary now than ever before.”

Enver Solomon, a spokesperson for Together With Refugees and CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “Seventy years ago, after the horrors of the second world war, the UK signed the Refugee convention. We gave our commitment to protect people fleeing war and persecution. Since then, it has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. These are people who have gone on to make huge contributions to our communities as proud Britons. And we must continue to safeguard this promise of safety.”

"Don't these photographs alone just lift your mood?

Alpaca and llama therapy is one of the most popular alternative therapies available for the 152 people living in this care home in the German town of Rudolstadt.

Tobias Zeilinger, the head of the retirement home in the Thuringia region, said patients with dementia have been reacting well to the large fluffy animals.

During the visits, alpacas and llamas are taken up the lift to meet residents in their rooms, before taking a trip down to the garden where people take turns brushing them.

After consistently positive feedback, the decision was made to offer the animal visits regularly at the care home.

"“No one was grander and more soulful than you were.”

André Leon Talley, the influential fashion journalist and former editor-at-large of US Vogue under Anna Wintour, has died at the age of 73.

A larger-than-life character – and six foot seven inches tall – Talley was a pioneering figure in the fashion world. In a career that spanned six decades, Talley used his position to champion diversity on the runway and behind the scenes in the fashion world.

“For a generation of boys André Leon Talley was a beacon of grace and aspiration,” wrote playwright Jeremy O Harris.

Designer and close friend Diane von Furstenberg was among those to pay tribute on Wednesday. “Goodbye darling André … no one saw the world in a more glamorous way than you did,” she wrote. “No one was grander and more soulful than you were.”

Born in 1948 and raised in North Carolina in the Jim Crow era, Talley was a lifelong advocate of fashion, recalling in his 2020 memoir The Chiffon Trenches how he would visit his local library to read copies of Vogue magazine, which came to embody a world in which “bad things never happened”.

He once told the Guardian: “I want every person I come across – the stranger on the street, the church member in the pew next to me – to feel love.”

"‘Deborah’s amazing attitude was humbling and a lesson to us all.’

Tributes have poured in for Dame Deborah James, the ‘extraordinary’ podcaster and cancer campaigner, who has died at the age of 40.

Diagnosed with stage 3 bowel cancer in 2016, James began blogging about her diagnosis under the name of BowelBabe, and became best known for candidly and humorously sharing her experience of the disease as a host of the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C.

James was made a dame a few days after the launch of her fundraiser for cancer research, the @bowelbabefund, which has so far raised more than £6m.

The NHS chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, said: ‘Not only will her fundraising have helped countless other cancer patients but her determination to raise awareness will undoubtedly have saved many lives.’

In James's final message, shared by her family on her Instagram account, she said: ‘Find a life worth enjoying; take risks; love deeply; have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope. And finally, check your poo – it could just save your life. x’

"The official portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama have been unveiled at the White House in an emotional and overdue ceremony.

Customarily, a former president returns for the unveiling during the tenure of his successor. But the Obamas did not have their ceremony while Donald Trump was in office.

Speaking after his portrait was unveiled, Barack thanked the artists Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung.

On McCurdy’s photorealistic painting style, Obama noted how “he captures every wrinkle of your face, every crease of your shirt, [and] you’ll note he refused all of my requests to make my ears smaller,” he said.

“He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way,” Obama added to laughter and applause, a nod to the social media firestorm that occurred when he wore such a suit in 2014.

Meanwhile, Michelle hailed the portraits as a reminder of American opportunity, saying “there’s a place for everyone in this country”. “If the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world,” she said, “it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can too.”‪

"12, 19 and 13.

Those are the ages of the silver, gold and bronze Olympic medallists in the women’s skateboard park event at Tokyo 2020.

In a whirlwind of handplants, nose grinds, aerials, leaps, twists, spins, and flips, Sakura Yosozumi, Kokona Hiraki and Sky Brown claimed the top three spots at the Ariake Urban Arena.

It was acrobatics at a hundred miles an hour.

Yosozumi, 19, won the gold medal in front of her home crowd, saying: ""I won gold because I enjoyed the competition. I had so much fun. I did all the tricks altogether. The relaxed atmosphere was the key.""

Her compatriot 12-year-old Hiraki finished second to become the youngest Olympic medallist in 85 years.

She is six-weeks younger than Sky Brown, 13, who after falling in her first two runs of the final, nailed her last attempt to claim bronze, making her the youngest medallist in British history.

After the event, Brown, who was born in Miyazaki, Japan, to a Japanese mother and British father a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, said: ""I am so happy. It's insane to be here. I am so happy to be on the podium with these guys. They are so amazing. Everyone ripped. I am honestly just happy be in Tokyo. But getting on the podium is insane.""

"“We’re running out of time, the clock is ticking,"" said Anna Staneva, the interim head of conservation at BirdLife Europe and Central Asia, after Europe's latest ""red list"" report revealed that one in five bird species on the continent are now at risk of extinction.

Birds that have been the cornerstones of our ecosystems - including
the common swift, common snipe and rook - are among species disappearing, while the Pallas’s sandgrouse, common buttonquail and pine bunting (pictured above) have all become regionally extinct.

A species is regionally extinct if it has not been observed in Europe over a minimum period of five years.

The BirdLife International analysis, which is based on observations of 544 native bird species, report that 30% of species assessed are showing population decline, according to observations from thousands of experts and volunteers working in 54 countries and territories.

However, it is not all bad news. The recovery of the bittern, Azores bullfinch and griffon vulture show targeted action on species recovery can work. Certain raptors such as red kites are doing better thanks to the banning of pesticides such as DDT and legal protection against persecution.

The latest list will help inform on-the-ground conservation action and national and international environment policies.

Recommendations from the report include creating a larger and better managed network of protected areas, consistent with the UN target of protecting 30% of land by 2030, with substantial areas under strict protection, such as “no take” marine protected areas and “no logging” forests.

"This is the story of Rajan, the last ocean-swimming elephant, along with the fascinating background to this powerful image:

In the 1970s, Rajan was brought to the Andaman Islands, an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal, with nine other elephants to help log the islands; all were forced to learn how to swim in the ocean.

Elephants love fresh water but they don’t like salt water because it stings their eyes and dries their skin. The elephants would drag the giant cut badak trees and swim them out to barges.

Once an island was logged, the elephants would be made to swim to the next island. They’d sometimes swim miles, which was mind-blowing: a group of 10 elephants swimming in open ocean.

When logging was banned in 2002, Rajan was out of a job.

He was the last elephant of the group to survive and lived out his days on Havelock (now Swaraj) Island until his death in 2016.

When @jodymacdonaldphoto met Rajan, he was around 60 years old, living out his retirement with Nazroo, his caretaker, who in India is called a mahout.

The Canadian photographer says: ""Every morning, Rajan would go into the jungle or walk down to the beach. He went swimming whenever he felt like it. He seemed to have adapted to swimming in salt water and even to enjoy it. I truly felt like he was having fun swimming in the ocean. I think that comes across in this picture. Many people tell me it looks like he’s smiling.""

MacDonald took this photo on one of the rare occasions Rajan went on a longer swim. ""He’d totally immerse himself and use his trunk like a snorkel, which was so cool,"" she said, explaining she used a weight belt to freedive down and get the angle she wanted.

""Spending time with Rajan was an amazing experience. He was probably the last ocean-swimming elephant we’ll ever see, which gives the image extra poignancy.

""As logging bans have increased, using elephants for logging has significantly diminished. I think it still happens in some Asian countries, but it’s a practice that’s thankfully fading.""

"“I am human. And I too sometimes long for joy, light and fun amidst these dark clouds.""

Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, fought back tears today as she gave a forceful defence of her work record and her right to a private life following recent criticisms she has faced over a leaked video of her partying.

The clips, which were leaked last week, showed her dancing exuberantly with friends and drinking at a party at which unsubstantiated reports claimed drugs may have been circulating.

Marin, 36, who was delivering a speech at her Social Democratic Party's (SDP) event in Lahti city, north of Helsinki, also apologised for the second time in a week yesterday after a photograph of two topless women taken at a party inside the Finnish prime minister’s official residence last month was published on social media.

Following the video leak, the prime minister volunteered for a drugs test “for my own legal protection and to clear up any doubts”. She passed. But in the fallout of the ""scandal"", Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi has called into question the apparent sexist double standards at play.

""While Boris Johnson having multiple children with numerous women is dismissed as boys will be boys, a woman having fun at home with her friends is treated like an untrustworthy hedonist,"" writes Mahdawi.

"“It took me a sporting lifetime to say I was proud to be a swimmer,” says former professional athlete, Michael Gunning.

The swimmer, who has competed for Great Britain and Jamaica, grew up hearing racist negative stereotypes like “Black people don’t swim” and “Black people sink in water,” and knows first hand how these comments can stop people, especially people of colour, from participating in sport.

Last year, @‌michaelgunning1 decided to step away from competitive sport and now has made it his mission to provide opportunities for the disadvantaged and underprivileged children and further eliminate the negative stereotypes around Black boys and girls swimming.

He’s become a Speedo ambassador on their Swim United campaign which aims to unite different communities all over the world, to support pupils taking up swimming. He says, “I want to work on diversifying sport as a whole and eliminate these barriers to get more representation of all children in grassroots sport.”

Gunning thinks positive representation is one way we can encourage young people of colour to take up swimming. He hopes Disney’s remake of The Little Mermaid with Black actor and singer @‌hallebailey will provide inspire young viewers.

“I see a glow in the young children’s eyes when they watch the trailer of The Little Mermaid for the first time - they can finally see themselves in roles like this,” says Gunning.

He say he wants others to learn from the racism he has had to content with throughout his career, watch the video to hear what he has to say.

"“Cover someone else's story, follow someone else” says presenter and journalist Chanté Joseph responding to the BBC’s latest Panorama episode: ‘Private ADHD Clinics Exposed.'

In the film that came out last Monday night, the documentary aimed to show people that patients are being offered powerful drugs and are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after unreliable online assessments.

After watching the episode, however, a number of people who have ADHD criticised the piece, including @chantayyjayy. She said: “The main problem with the documentary is that it makes ADHD diagnosis look very trivial and easy and accessible” - and for her that wasn’t the case.

In the video we talk to Chanté and Dr. Samantha Hiew (@adhd_girls), about the need for better intersectional representation of the ADHD community and why it’s much easier for white men to get diagnosed.

A BBC spokesperson said: “Panorama made clear that ADHD is a recognised condition affecting many adults and highlighted the long waits for assessment and treatment on the NHS in some areas.

“This was an investigation into the way some private clinics diagnose and prescribe ADHD medication following assessments conducted over online video calls.

“We recognise the profound impact the condition can have on people’s lives and have taken great care to ensure the programme doesn’t stigmatise people who have ADHD. We encourage people to watch the documentary.”

"Have you seen a sweeter video this week?

Jackson's Animal Rescue in the UK posted this clip of three hoglets being served breakfast after being rescued.

Mindy, Aragorn and Gimli were given specially formulated puppy milk and kitten food ... because - in case you didn't know - the prickly animals - who are known for their voracious appetites, are also lactose intolerant.

According to estimates the number of hedgehogs in Britain have declined by 90% since the second world war because of a loss of habitat and food on farmland.

Conservation groups are trying to create suitable places for hedgehogs to thrive, such as collections of urban gardens and less manicured parks - and there is of course the efforts of rescue centres like @jacksonsanimalrescue.

""We then wean them onto solid food when old enough and once a healthy size and weight, we release them back into the wild,"" a trustee at Jackson's Animal Rescue, Greer Lacey.

"Households could save more than £400 a year on energy bills if clocks are not put back at the end of October, according to a clean energy expert at Queen’s University Belfast, who said it would help people with the cost of living crisis and reduce pressure on the National Grid this winter.

But that may not be the right fit for you and your family.

The prospect of huge home energy bills this winter means Britons are desperately casting around for ways to reduce how much gas and electricity they use. Here are eight of the simplest ideas, from hooded blankets to chimney balloons, that could help to curb costs.

"The Queen’s lawyers secretly lobbied Scottish ministers to change a draft law to exempt her private land from a major initiative to cut carbon emissions, documents reveal.

The exemption means the Queen, one of the largest landowners in Scotland, is the only person in the country not required to facilitate the construction of pipelines to heat buildings using renewable energy.

Her lawyers secured the dispensation from Scotland’s government five months ago by exploiting an obscure parliamentary procedure known as Queen’s consent, which gives the monarch advance sight of legislation.

In a series of reports into Queen’s consent in recent months, the Guardian revealed how the Queen repeatedly used her privileged access to draft laws to lobby ministers to change UK legislation to benefit her private interests or reflect her opinions between the late 1960s and the 1980s.

The new documents, uncovered by Lily Humphreys, a researcher for the Scottish Liberal Democrats using freedom of information laws, disclose how the monarch used her special access to Scottish legislation to intervene in the parliamentary process as recently as February.

The documents also suggest Nicola Sturgeon’s government failed to disclose the monarch’s lobbying this year when a Scottish politician used a parliamentary debate to query why the Queen was securing an exemption from the green energy bill.

The move appears at odds with the royal family’s public commitment to tackling the climate crisis, with Prince William recently joining his father, Charles, in campaigning to cut emissions and protect the planet.

"The freestyle motocross rider Tom Pages pulled off an amazing first in the ski resort of Avoriaz in France – riding off a sheer cliff and performing a double front flip before parachuting down.

@tompages attacked the seven-metre ramp at 50 mph and shot out more than 55 metres from the cliff before gliding back down to the ground.

After successfully completing two complete front flips, Pages released a specially designed parachute and glided to safety over the picturesque ravine. A second chute deployed on his motorcycle.

'What's going to get me stoked after that?' Pages said as he reflected on his achievement. 'I don't know. I'm going to have to find something even more stupid to have fun.'

Pages is no stranger to extreme sports: he is a multiple Red Bull X-Fighters champion and a five-time X Games gold medallist.

"Is 70 the new 50?

This 71-year-old model thinks so. Sarah Grant donned a swimsuit to make her Australian fashion week runway debut on Thursday.

“It’s great for older women to see a more mature person wearing an outfit because then they can relate to it, and it’s good for business because baby boomers are one of the largest demographics when it comes to buying fashion,” Grant says.

Grant may be new to Australian fashion week but she is a veteran of international modelling. Her first catwalk appearance was for Pierre Cardin in New Zealand at the age of 16.

Valentino, Karl Lagerfeld and Zandra Rhodes were among the brands she walked for in Paris, Milan and London before returning to Australia, where she appeared on the cover of Playboy with an electric guitar in the 70s.

Grant says the modelling industry has changed immensely since she got her first big break in the 60s. “We were all just regular sizes – a size 10 or size 12 – so there wasn’t that pressure to be slim. When the super skinny look came in it was really tragic for the business and a lot of girls ended up with issues because of it.”

"Novak Djokovic’s Australian visa has again been cancelled just days before the start of the Australian Open.

The Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, exercised a personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa, likely to result in the world No 1’s deportation and putting him out of contention for the grand slam tournament barring an against-the-odds court victory.

The decision means that Djokovic could be effectively barred from re-entering Australia for three years unless he can show in future bids that compelling circumstances exist, such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds.

Djokovic will attend an interview with immigration officials on Saturday, after which he can choose to leave Australia or appeal the decision. In a statement Hawke said he cancelled the visa “on health and good order grounds, [and] on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so”.

The decision to cancel the visa likely leaves the Australian Open without one of its biggest stars and Djokovic – who was seeking a record-breaking 21st grand slam triumph – unable to defend the title he has won nine times.

Here's a recap of how Djokovic's visa controversy has unfolded so far.

"From major portraits of the likes of Naomi Campbell, FKA Twigs and Tyler, the Creator to cover shoots for leading magazines, Campbell Addy has quickly become one of the most in-demand photographers of his generation.

@campbelladdy has now released a new book which features his striking imagery woven between trailblazing Black creatives reflecting on the first time they say they felt seen in their industry.

""The first time I got in front of the camera lens and looked up to see Campbell Addy, I realised something special was happening,"" @naomi told the Guardian in a 2019 interview.

""There was something in that moment that felt sacred. It occurred to me that this was the first time a Black photographer had shot me for a mainstream publication in my 33-and-a-half-year career.""

Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who styled Tyler, the Creator in this gallery, says: ""I spent a lot of time trying to make myself smaller so I could slip through the cracks or camouflage the parts of me that didn’t “fit”. André Leon Talley [the late creative director of Vogue] was the first Black person I became aware of who had a seat at the table – at the very top of the mountain – who insisted on taking up space. He represented possibility to me.""

Addy, who is also a filmmaker, says he balances his own experiences as a queer, Black photographer who left his Jehovah’s Witness family home at 16 with broader questions of identity, intimacy and art which face many creatives today. ""I thought, well, where do I fit in as an image-maker? Once you get rid of the queer, the Black, the male, whatever, then it’s just my interests. The things I like to explore.

""... In theory, my work is about showcasing. It’s about putting things within my world under the microscope. My book is about feeling seen because every person, every object, needs to be handled with care. That’s kind of where the title came from.""

Addy's new book, Feeling Seen, is out now through Prestel Publishing.

"Amazon's tax affairs are in the spotlight again after its latest income figures were released.

The company brought in a record £38 billion (€44bn) from sales in Europe last year but did not have to pay any corporation tax to the Grand Duchy on the profits it made.

Accounts for Amazon EU Sarl - which it sells products to hundreds of millions of households in the UK and across Europe - show that the Luxembourg unit made a €1.2bn loss and therefore paid no tax. They employ just 5,262 staff there meaning that the income per person amounts to €8.4m.

Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation said: ""These figures are mind-blowing, even for Amazon ... The bulk of Amazon’s UK income is booked offshore, in the enormously loss-making Luxembourg subsidiary, which means that not only are they not making a meaningful tax contribution now, but are unlikely to do so for years to come given the enormous carried forward losses they have now built up.”

An Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon pays all the taxes required in every country where we operate. Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given our heavy investments and the fact that retail is a highly competitive, low margin business.""

But Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP has said: “It seems that Amazon’s relentless campaign of appalling tax avoidance continues ... [their] revenues have soared under the pandemic while our high streets struggle.""

Last month, Joe Biden tabled plans for a minimum corporation tax rate, which would force large technology companies and corporations to pay taxes to national governments based on the sales they generate in each country, irrespective of where they are based. Germany and France have backed the plans but the UK has thus far remained silent.

Amazon owner Jeff Bezos - the world’s richest person - welcomed Biden’s proposals and said the company was “supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate”.

"On 1 July 1972 Ted Brown walked through central London, stopped at Trafalgar Square for a kiss – and made history.

He was at the event he had helped to organise, the UK’s first official Gay Pride, in which more than 2,000 people marched through the capital before holding a mass kiss-in.

Half a century later, his memories of the day are euphoric. “It was amazing,” he says. “I felt that we were continuing the legacy of the civil rights march.”

"“If you look across the world Maui is literally on fire … I don’t know if my ancestral land will still be there if I have children.”

This is what author and climate activist Mikaela Loach said as she staged a walkout of her own book talk alongside two authors at this year’s Edinburgh International Book Festival.

Why? They were protesting the festival’s sponsor’s links to fossil fuel companies, specifically their main sponsor, investment company Baillie Gifford.

The festival has already come under fire for their sponsors, with more than 100 authors sending an open letter this week calling on the event to drop any backers that invest in fossil fuels. Climate activist Greta Thunberg also said that she was cancelling her scheduled appearance at the festival, accusing Baillie Gifford of “greenwashing”.

The Guardian has contacted Baillie Gifford and the festival for comment.

A representative from Baillie Gifford previously said that the firm “has nothing further to add” to the statement that it issued in response to Thunberg’s withdrawal. In that statement, Nick Thomas, a partner at Baillie Gifford, said the company is “not a significant fossil fuel investor”.

The company said in a previous briefing that only 2% of its clients’ money is invested in companies with more than 5% of their revenue coming from fossil fuel activities, compared with the market average of 11%. It also noted that it invested more than double the proportion of clients’ money “in companies dedicated to clean energy solutions”. It also disputes that £5bn has been invested in fossil fuel companies.

In response to the letter last week, the festival’s director, Nick Barley, thanked the authors and asked for time to consider their points. He said they had looked carefully at the firm before using them and concluded that they were investing more in green energy.

"Colombia has elected a former guerrilla fighter Gustavo Petro as president, making him the South American country’s first leftist head of state.

""We are writing history right now – a new history for Colombia, for Latin America and for the world,"" @gustavopetrourrego said.

Petro’s election marks a tidal shift for Colombia, a country that has never before had a leftist president, and follows similar victories for the left in Peru, Chile and Honduras.

During his victory speech, Petro issued a call for unity and extended an olive branch to some of his harshest critics, saying all members of the opposition will be welcomed at the presidential palace “to discuss the problems of Colombia”.

“From this government that is beginning there will never be political persecution or legal persecution, there will only be respect and dialogue,” he said, adding that he will listen to not only those who have raised arms but also to “that silent majority of peasants, Indigenous people, women, youth”.

He added: ""This is no longer time for resentment. This government that will begin on 7 August is a government of life, is a government that wants to build Colombia as a world life power. And if we summarise in three words what the government of life means, I would say first, peace, second, social justice, and third, environmental justice"".

Petro’s vice-president will be Francia Márquez – a prize-winning defender of human and environmental rights – marking the first time that a black woman fills the post.

"'They forget about the war for just a moment and think about something else.'

Violinist and teacher Vera Lytovchenko (@veralytovchenko), has traded a theatre for a basement in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine and played her violin for fellow residents taking cover from the Russian bombing.

Lytovchenko said she was inspired in seeing one of her students play in a makeshift bomb shelter at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

‘It is a big pleasure for me to have the ability to do something for my 'cellar family,’ Vera says.

The musician says the violin has become an important part of life in the past week because it helps comfort the people around her.

This video of Lytovchenko playing Ніч яка місячна (The Night is So Moonlit) has gone viral on Twitter, but Lytovchenko said she is mainly interested about her friends’ and colleagues’ reactions on Facebook because that is how she knows they are still alive.

Lytovchenko said she would stay in Kharkiv to rebuild the city. ‘I won’t just play,’ she said. ‘This is my land. I want to help rebuild the city with my own hands.’

"Despite devastating economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of millionaires in the world has increased.

There are now 56.1 million millionaires globally, up by 5.2 million people, according to the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report.

The figures capture how the rich cashed in on surging stock and house prices - and how emergency interest rate cuts and government stimulus measures often benefited those least in need of state support, helping their assets grow in value despite the downturn.

According to the latest edition of the International Labor Organization (ILO) Monitor, which was published at the beginning of the year, 114 million jobs were lost in 2020, which, in combination with working-hour reductions within employment, resulted in working-hour losses approximately four times as high as during the financial crisis in 2009.

The ILO estimates that the working hours lost in 2020 (compared to pre-pandemic levels) were equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs, leading to $3.7 trillion in lost labor income.

"What's the word for when you suddenly become aware of how small you are in comparison with the universe?

This is a photo of the Cartwheel Galaxy, which is about 500m light years away from our planet and is 1.5 times the size of our galaxy the Milky Way.

The incredible image was captured by Nasa's triumphant James Webb space telescope – the most powerful space observatory built to date. You can also see two smaller galaxies against a backdrop of many other galaxies.

The Cartwheel, which has been studied by scientists for decades, looks like a wheel because hundreds of millions of years ago, two galaxies collided.

A smaller galaxy plunged through the heart of a large spiral galaxy, creating expanding ripples of star formation.

""The Cartwheel Galaxy sports two rings – a bright inner ring and a surrounding, colourful ring. These two rings expand outwards from the centre of the collision, like ripples in a pond after a stone is tossed into it. Because of these distinctive features, astronomers call this a ‘ring galaxy’, a structure less common than spiral galaxies like our Milky Way,"" says Nasa.

The Cartwheel is continually expanding and new stars are being formed inside of it. There's no telling how large it will become.

"The Rock for president?

Professional wrestler turned star actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson says that he would run for US president if he felt he had enough support from Americans.

Johnson, 48, one of the highest-paid and most popular actors in the United States, has been flirting with a possible White House bid for several years. He did not say which party he would represent or when he might launch any bid.

His remarks follow an online public opinion poll released last week that found some 46% of Americans would consider voting for Johnson.

Johnson would join a long list of American celebrities who have run for political office, including Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger who became governor of California, former wrestler Jesse Ventura who became governor of Minnesota and former actor Ronald Reagan who become president as did former “Apprentice” star Donald Trump.

Adding to this actor Matthew McConaughey and former Olympic champion and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner are reported to be weighing potential runs for governor in Texas and California respectively.

"""The people have spoken""

The Democratic incumbent, Raphael Warnock, has fended off a challenge from Republican Herschel Walker and won the Georgia Senate runoff, securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his party’s majority in the chamber.

One of 12 children born to a father who was also a pastor and a mother who once picked cotton, in his acceptance speech last night Warnock reflected on the unlikelihood of his path to becoming a US senator.

The Associated Press called the race about three-and-a-half hours after polls closed in Georgia, as Warnock led Walker, by approximately 40,000 votes.

Warnock also told the crowd: “After a hard-fought campaign – or should I say campaigns – it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: the people have spoken.”

One of 12 children born to a father who was also a pastor and a mother who once picked cotton in his acceptance speech last night Warnock reflected on the unlikelihood of his path to becoming a US senator

The Associated Press called the race about threeandahalf hours after polls closed in Georgia as Warnock led Walker by approximately 40000 votes

"A truly incredible tribute.

When Ben Jackson - a sheep farmer from Australia - was unable to attend his aunt’s funeral due to Covid rules, he instead honoured her memory with a love heart made from sheep.

It took “three or four” attempts, said Ben, who added: “The first time I tried it looked like the shit emoji, I tell you, and whilst my Aunty Deb had a good sense of humour, that wasn’t exactly what I was going for.""

Ben's aunt died after a two-year fight with cancer that began at the start of the pandemic. Paying tribute, he told @guardianaustralia: ""Knowing my Aunty Deb, if this sheep art – if it brought a smile to even one person’s face, she would be a very proud aunty.""

"How does your body respond to alcohol?

There is evidence that humans were brewing their own booze even before the wheel caught on, but how much do we know about how it works on our brains and bodies?

Well, quite a bit. Recent decades have seen dozens of studies validate some old sayings, debunk others, and give the medical establishment a much clearer understanding of how alcohol affects us and how much it is really OK to drink.

"“They’re just two-faced. I’m just tired of them standing there and saying how wonderful the Capitol police is, and they turn around and … go down to Mar-a-Lago and kiss [Trump’s] ring.""

This is how the mother of Brian Sicknick, who died after a mob of Donald Trump supporters ransacked the US Capitol building, denounced Senior Republicans Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy at an event for the police who defended against the 6 January insurrection - according to a tweet by CNN congressional reporter Daniella Diaz.

During the Congressional Gold Medal award ceremony earlier this week, the January 6 officers and relatives walked straight past the Republican duo, barely looking at them.

McConnell, the Senate minority leader, was caught on video with his hand outstretched, waiting in line for handshakes that never came as senior officers and Sicknick’s parents warmly greeted the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer.

McCarthy, who hopes to become Speaker when Republicans take over the House majority next month, was widely condemned for what analysts said was a pilgrimage to Donald Trump’s Florida resort in the days after the insurrection.

Both McConnell and McCarthy have been criticised for not standing up to Trump.

"‘Would a male competitor be similarly criticised?’

Double Paralympic world champion Olivia Breen asked this question after being told that her competition briefs were “too short and inappropriate” by a female official while competing at the English Championships in Bedford this weekend.

The 24-year-old, who is set to compete at the Paralympics in Tokyo next month, said she was wearing official Adidas briefs for 2021 – and questioned whether a male athlete would ever have been subjected to such comments.

“I am alway grateful for the incredible volunteers who officiate at athletics events,” said Breen, who has cerebral palsy. “They do an amazing job and make it possible for us to compete. However, tonight I feel disappointed because just as I finished my long jump competition one of the female officials felt it necessary to inform me that my sprint briefs were too short and inappropriate. I was left speechless.

“I have been wearing the same sprint style briefs for many years and they are specifically designed for competing in,” she added. “I will hopefully be wearing them in Tokyo. It made me question whether a male competitor would be similarly criticised.”

An England Athletics spokesperson said: “We are aware of the post and will be investigating as a matter of urgency. The wellbeing of all participants in athletics is of the utmost importance and everyone should feel comfortable to compete and participate in the sport.”

"“It’s a crazy feeling. It’s like more than a dream come true. I mean, it’s insane.”

Sky Brown will become Britain’s youngest summer Olympian when she competes in Tokyo at the age of 13 years and 11 days alongside 14-year-old Bombette Martin, with both girls making history with their inclusion in skateboarding’s debut on the biggest stage in sport.

Speaking as their official selection was confirmed, Brown said that by being “the little one in there, going big” she hoped she could showcase the merits of the sport to which she has dedicated her young life, and show other girls they have no reason to be afraid.

Martin said the reality was only just sinking in: “I’m going to be an Olympian and I’m going to be able to say that for the rest of my life. I’m just so excited.”

When Brown competes in Tokyo she will claim the title of Britain’s youngest summer Olympian from the swimmer Margery Hinton, who was 13 years and 44 days when she competed in Amsterdam in 1928.

"What do you think of cars flying above us in less than 10 years time?

According to a leading car manufacturer, flying cars will be a reality in cities around the globe by the end of this decade, and will help to reduce congestion and cut vehicle emissions.

Michael Cole, the chief executive of the European operations of South Korean carmaker Hyundai, said the firm had made some “very significant investments” in urban air mobility, adding: “We believe it really is part of the future”.

He told an industry conference: “It’s part of our future solution of offering innovative, smart mobility solutions.”

Hyundai showcased its flying car concept, developed in conjunction with the ride-sharing firm Uber, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2020.

The company is also involved in the UK’s first airport without a runway, designed for aircraft that are capable of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL), scheduled to open in Coventry later this year.

The “urban airport” could be used by aircraft including air taxis and autonomous delivery drones.

"""I don’t want to go into my job and feel violated.”

When Grace Velez went to work wearing pigtails, she expected a typical shift.

Instead, she received lots of sexualised comments from male customers and unwarranted winks, and went home with double the number of tips she usually gets. 

Eventually, @_gracevv realised that the new hairstyle might have something to do with it.

After sharing her story on TikTok, Grace inspired the ""pigtail experiment"", in which women shared their experiences of being sexualised while wearing pigtails in the service industry.

“I think there needs to be more awareness and protection around the fetishisation of women at work,” says Grace.

"Masses of ocean plastic are providing artificial habitat for otherwise coastal species, according to a new study.

So what exactly does this mean? And what are ""neopelagic communities""?

The authors of this new study - published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature Communications - say they observed floating water bottles, old toothbrushes and matted fishing nets - and concluded that the possibility exists that species may be evolving to better adapt to life on plastic.

A decade ago, marine researchers believed coastal organisms, which evolved to live along sheltered shorelines, could not survive a trip across the inhospitable open ocean.

Yet Japan’s 2011 tsunami, which sent some 300 species of Asian marine life riding durable and buoyant plastic garbage onto North American shores, disproved that assumption.

Now, scientists believe seafaring colonies of anemones, brittle stars, shrimp, barnacles and more, are thriving on plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and washing up wherever the currents take them.

Ocean plastic is “… creating opportunities for coastal species’ biogeography to greatly expand beyond what we previously thought was possible”, Linsey Haram, a research associate at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and coauthor of the study, said.

But the sheer density of plastic in the ocean is still a great concern, according to marine ecotoxicologist experts like Juan José Alava, PhD at the University of British Columbia.

While small species can make a life for themselves within these permanent floating plastic structures, they also attract creatures higher up the food chain, like fish, turtles and larger mammals, who through curiosity become caught and entangled in the plastic and die.

“The 2021 UN report after Cop26 was clear that the scale of rapidly increasing plastic pollution is putting the health of all the world’s oceans and seas at risk,” says Alava.

"An abomination, disgraceful and shocking.

That's how campaigners have described the truly seismic news that has broken in the US overnight: the leak of a draft majority opinion which appears to show that the supreme court has privately voted to overturn half a century of protection for abortion rights.

The leak, to the Politico website, was immediately the subject of intense textual and legal analysis by US journalists and experts trying to corroborate its authenticity. It would be the worst security breach in the court’s history.

But while caution is obviously the right approach on such a momentous issue, there was every sign – from the document’s formatting and footnotes to the distinctive tone of conservative author Justice Samuel Alito – that it is legitimate. There was no comment from the supreme court itself.

The court could still vote the other way. But if the end of Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion, does happen, it would be news of generational significance for American women and a huge blow for supporters of reproductive rights around the world.

"This charcoal and pencil drawing of Isaac Kyoyeta, an events manager in Kampala, is the work of Martin Senkubuge - a Ugandan artist who is challenging the stigma surrounding the skin condition vitiligo.

Through his portraits, Senkubuge aims to make people with the condition ""proud of their skin"" rather than ""cursed"", which he says is the way many people in the region are made to feel.

“People said that persons with vitiligo were cursed and bewitched,” says Senkubuge. “There was a lot of myths and misinformation surrounding them, which was unfair.”

The 22-year-old started reaching out to contacts who knew people who had the skin condition via social media, proposing to draw their pictures. It wasn’t easy.

“I got about 60 contacts, but only three showed up for the photoshoot,” he recalls. But he would not give up. He encouraged those three models to try to persuade others to participate in his campaign.

“I told them my intentions,” says Senkubuge. “I wanted them to pose, stand tall, and be proud of who they are. I told them that art is beautiful and that healing begins from within.”

An estimated 1% of the global population have vitiligo, which isn’t contagious and can be hereditary, caused by an autoimmune disease or trigged by a stressful event, severe skin damage or exposure to certain chemicals. But it gets little attention, largely because it is regarded as a cosmetic condition rather than life-threatening.

People with vitiligo are “already beautiful”, Senkubuge says. “We just want them to believe it.” He now plans to take his pictures, and the campaign, across east Africa.

"The first UK baby created with DNA from three people has been born after doctors performed a groundbreaking IVF procedure that aims to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases, the Guardian's science editor, Ian Sample, has revealed in his exclusive.

The technique, known as mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT), uses tissue from the eggs of healthy female donors to create IVF embryos that are free from harmful mutations their mothers carry — as people inherit all their mitochondria from their mother — and are likely to pass on to their children.

Because the embryos combine sperm and egg from the biological parents with tiny battery-like structures called mitochondria from the donor’s egg, the resulting baby has DNA from the mother and father as usual, plus a small amount of genetic material – about 37 genes – from the donor.

The process has led to the phrase “three-parent babies”, though more than 99.8% of the DNA in the babies comes from the mother and father.

The UK is not the first country to use the MDT technique. In 2016, a US doctor announced the world’s first MDT birth after treating a Jordanian woman who carried mitochondrial mutations that cause a fatal condition called Leigh syndrome.

Progress with MDT led parliament to change the law in 2015 to permit the procedure. Two years later, Newcastle Fertility Centre became the first and only national centre licensed to perform it, with the first cases approved in 2018. Approval is given on a case-by-case basis by the UK’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which has given the green light for at least 30 cases.

"Sir Ian McKellen played Shakespeare’s tragic prince in 1971. Now, half a century later aged 82, he’s starring as Hamlet once again in an age-blind production at the Theatre Royal Windsor.

In an interview with the Guardian published last month, @ianmckellen told us during rehearsals cast mates of all ages have said they keep forgetting whether he’s 80-odd or 30-odd. “I’ve been having the time of my life.”

By the sound of it, the new production - one of the year’s hottest stage tickets - will have fun with the crisscrossing age dynamics, as a young-ish character inhabits an older man’s body; as an experienced pro brings all his technical nous to bear on a role that’s traditionally played by an actor nearer the start of a career than the end.

“When I was young I was always playing old parts,” McKellen says. “And, of course, I was having to imagine it. Because what does ‘old’ mean? I had no idea! Now that I’m old I do know. And I also know what it’s like to be young. Because as you get older, inside, you’re ageless. Inside? Quite honestly? I feel about 12.”

"Many travellers trek to remote destinations in search of the perfect picture.
But at what cost?

When photographer @natachademahieu arrived at the edge of Obersee, a remote German lake surrounded by lush green mountains and dramatic waterfalls, in August last year she was confronted by the idea of Instagram versus reality.

It was chilly and rain was pelting down, but as tourists came and took photos of themselves against the view, De Mahieu noticed how many would shed their layers in defiance of the cold to convey the image of a blissful summer.

For a photo series as part of a project for her master's degree in documentary photography, De Mahieu went to some of the most geotagged European tourist destinations on Instagram.

Instead of trying to get the perfect shot, she used Photoshop to produce a timelapse collage that showed the reality of all the people who had visited the area over a period of time.

The series, which she calls Theatre of Authenticity, is a commentary on how social media can transform places into must-see destinations – and how an influencer’s Instagram post can open the floodgates.

""I wanted to show the impact of that kind of ‘invisible tourism’ on these places. When I say invisible, I mean that when you’re there you have a feeling that you are alone. But over an hour, or an afternoon, there are a lot of people going there,"" she says.

For example, De Mahieu's image of the Pont d’Arc, a large natural bridge in Ardèche, south-east France, was made from photographs taken over a period of 80 minutes at the height of the tourist season. The final result, made from 100 images, took more than a week to complete.

"“Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.”

Brazilian virtuoso Pelé, whose captivating skill and athleticism ensured he was universally regarded as one of football’s greatest players, has died at the age of 82.

Pelé, who had a colon tumour removed last year, was readmitted to Albert Einstein hospital in São Paulo in recent days with general swelling amid deteriorating health. He was then moved to palliative care.

Brazil’s all-time record scorer won three World Cups as a player, in 1958, 1962 and 1970, over a 14-year international career that included 72 goals in 92 appearances for Brazil.

Nicknamed “The Black Pearl” and “The King”, Pelé was one of only three players to have scored in four World Cups - and scored a world record 1,281 goals in 1,363 games. Tap the link in bio to read more about his legacy.

On 1 July 1972, Peter Tatchell and 30 other members of the Gay Liberation Front (@gayliberationfrontuk) made history by organising the protest, which celebrated and fought for LGBTQ+ people in the UK.

It was a crucial turning point for the nation's LGBTQ+ rights movement and has inspired Pride marches every year since … Tatchell has been to every single one of them.

‘To think what began in 1972 was one Pride with 700 marchers has now grown to 150 Pride events involving a million people. What a difference 50 years makes,’ @petertatchell1 said.

Will you be going to a Pride parade this year? 🏳️‍🌈

"Is there anything they can't do?

Dog could now be used for mass coronavirus screening in crowded places, after a study concluded that they are better at detecting the virus in humans than many fast lateral flow tests.

The trial, conducted in March and April by France’s national veterinary school and the clinical research unit of Paris’s Necker-Cochin hospital, showed canines were able to detect the presence of the virus with 97% accuracy.

Researchers collected samples, cotton pads pressed for two minutes under participants’ armpits, from 335 people aged between six and 76 who presented themselves for a PCR test at testing centres in Paris.

The pads were then sealed in jars and given to at least two of the nine dogs used in the trial to be sniffed. The dogs’ handlers did not know in advance which samples were positive.

The dogs detected 97% of the 109 people whose PCR test subsequently proved positive, and 91% of those whose PCR test was negative.

A recent review of 64 studies found LFTs correctly identify on average 72% of people infected with the virus who have symptoms, and 58% who do not.

Prof Jean-Marc Tréluyer hailed the ""excellent results"" and the dogs' quick response. While they won't replace polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are significantly more reliable than LFT tests, they could ""help identify those people who should undergo a full viral test"" in places such as airports, train stations and concert venues.

Researchers in countries including Australia, Germany and Britain have experimented with dogs to detect Covid, while Finland and the United Arab Emirates last year launched trials with sniffer dogs at Helsinki and Dubai international airports.",2021-05-20 20:01:01,"Is there anything they cant do

"“The public have the right to know what role money plays in our politics.”

This is what Steve Goodrich, the head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK said about the Guardian’s recent investigation into shares held ‘in secret’ by several dozen MPs or their close family members.

The shareholdings identified by our reporter, Henry Dyer, are all within companies that could be affected by legislation or new policy introduced by parliament.

The companies include, for example, the likes of oil and gas company BP; our investigation found that six MPs or their close family members have shares that in total are worth nearly a combined £120,000.

Almost all of the holdings found are not strictly required to be publicly declared under parliamentary transparency rules requiring the disclosure of a shareholding in any single company worth more than £70,000 or more than 15% of the company’s stock. In comparison, members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have to declare within 45 days any trade in stocks over $1,000.

This means an MP could trade £69,999.99 in shares in a single company and not strictly be required to disclose the financial dealing. They could hold stakes of this level in several companies operating in the same sector and still not be strictly required to declare the holdings.

The difficulty in uncovering who owns shares in publicly listed companies in this country “renders them in effect secret” — which is “very concerning”, says Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption.

“If an MP has shares in a company affected by legislation going through parliament, there’s invariably a tension between them protecting their financial affairs and advancing the public good”, says Goodrich.

“Understanding who has skin in what game is essential to unpicking policy inertia, be it on housing, climate change or the cost of living.”

"The offspring of hippos once owned by Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar can be recognized as people or “interested persons” with legal rights in the US following a federal court order.

The case involves a lawsuit against the Colombian government over whether to kill or sterilize the hippos, whose numbers are growing at a fast pace and pose a threat to biodiversity.

The so-called “cocaine hippos” – pictured above – are descendants of animals that Escobar illegally imported to his Colombian ranch in the 1980s when he reigned over the country’s drug trade.

After his death in a 1993 shootout with authorities, the hippos were abandoned at the estate and left to thrive, with no natural predators. Their numbers have increased in the last eight years from 35 to somewhere between 65 and 80.

A group of scientists has warned that the hippos pose a threat to the area’s biodiversity and could lead to deadly encounters with humans. They are advocating for some of the animals to be killed. A government agency has started sterilizing some of the hippos, but there is a debate on what are the safest methods.

An animal rights groups is hailing the order as a milestone victory in the longstanding efforts to sway the US justice system to grant animals personhood status.

But the order, granted by federal magistrate judge Karen Litkovitz in Cincinnati, will not carry any weight in Colombia where the hippos live, a legal expert said.

Christopher Berry, the lead attorney for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, called it a narrow but profound ruling.

“This really is part of a bigger movement of advocating that animals’ interest be represented in court,” he said. “We’re not asking to make up a new law. We’re just asking that animals have the ability to enforce the rights that have already been given to them.”

"""Don’t you dare"".

That was Kate Winslet's response when a director suggested possibly editing a sex scene in which she showed a “bulgy bit of belly” for her latest television series.

The actor claimed Craig Zobel, the director of her new HBO series Mare of Easttown, had offered to show her body in a more flattering light.

Winslet, who plays detective and a grandmother Mare Sheehan in a Pennsylvania town in the new programme, said she had refused - adding that she twice sent back the promotional poster for the drama because she felt it had been altered too much.

“I’m like: ‘Guys, I know how many lines I have by the side of my eye, please put them all back,’” Winslet, 45, told the New York Times.

The Academy Award winning actor added: “Listen, I hope that in playing Mare as a middle-aged woman – I will be 46 in October – I guess that’s why people have connected with this character in the way that they have done because there are clearly no filters.

“She’s a fully functioning, flawed woman with a body and a face that moves in a way that is synonymous with her age and her life and where she comes from. I think we’re starved of that a bit.”

"Joe Biden has announced a “trailblazing” set of 11 federal judicial nominees, including three Black women.

The picks include US district judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was nominated to replace attorney general Merrick Garland on the influential US appeals court for the District of Columbia circuit.

In December, Biden asked senators for a diverse list of possible judicial picks, saying his administration wanted to focus on ""nominating individuals whose legal experiences have been historically underrepresented on the federal bench"".

After announcing his first picks, Biden told the Washington Post; ""This trailblazing set of nominees draws from the very best and brightest minds of the American legal profession"".

The other nominees include: Zahid Quraishi, Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, Tiffany Cunningham, Florence Pan, Lydia Griggsby, and Judge Rupa Ranga Puttagunta.

"Have you reduced how much meat you eat?

Britons have cut their meat consumption by 17% over the past decade but will need to double these efforts if they are to meet targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production set out earlier this year.

Meat production is a major contributor to global heating and land degradation, while eating lots of red and processed meat has been linked to a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.

For these reasons, the government-commissioned national food strategy for England recently recommended that people try to cut their meat consumption by about 30% within the next decade.

To understand how much meat people in the UK are currently eating, Cristina Stewart, a health behaviours researcher at the University of Oxford, and colleagues turned to dietary data recorded in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey. This annual exercise involves asking a nationally representative sample of the population to keep a food diary for four consecutive days.

The analysis found that between 2008-9 and 2018-19 participants’ average meat consumption decreased from about 103g per person a day to 86g, a reduction of about 17g or 17%. This is equivalent to eating roughly two and a half fewer pork sausages each week.

There was an absolute reduction of 13.7g of red meat and 7g processed meat, and a 3.2g increase in white meat consumption.

Stewart said: “I think the reductions that we’re seeing are positive, but we’re moving pretty slowly, and if we continue reducing our intake at the same rate, we’re not really going to be reaching these dietary targets.”

Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We need to look beyond meat to benefit from the full range of protein sources available to us. Including plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, nuts and seeds, or using these to bulk out meat dishes can be a healthy way to cut down on the amount of red and processed meat you are eating.”

"***UPDATE*** The federal government has decided to match the bonus for Paralympians.

In late July, as soon as Emma McKeon won the first of her four gold medals at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, she was guaranteed a $20,000 bonus.

Last week, when another Australian swimmer, Lakeisha Patterson, did the same thing at the same venue, she received nothing.

The difference? One was competing at an Olympic Games, and the other a Paralympics.

It is through no fault of her own that McKeon is both able-bodied and highly decorated enough to qualify her for the Australian Olympic Committee’s lucrative cash prizes. The AOC simply has the money to reward its athletes while its para-counterpart, Paralympics Australia, does not.

Still, the stark discrepancy – felt by para-athletes throughout the Paralympic cycle – has become externally apparent during the Tokyo 2020 Games. Australian viewers watching more intently while in lockdown have voiced their discomfort, and one able-bodied sportswoman has done something about it.

Chloe Dalton, who was a part of Australia’s gold medal-winning rugby sevens team at Rio 2016 and now plays for the AFLW’s GWS Giants, had read about Team USA’s parity in this space, with Olympic and Paralympic gold medallists each receiving $52,000.

“I assumed it was going to be the same for Australian Paralympians,” she says. “So I was pretty shocked when it came out that they actually received nothing when they win a medal.”

"""It is just so heartbreaking that so many [whales] have beached themselves,"" says local volunteer Kaysanne Knucke, as rescuers try to save a pod of long-finned pilot whales after a mass beaching in Western Australia.

Drone footage showed the moment the pod of almost 100 whales moved tightly together before becoming stranding at Cheynes beach about 60km (37 miles) east of Albany on Tuesday evening.

Knunckey, along with other volunteers, were waist-deep in the ocean from 7.30am until after 11am, pulling the live mammals back into the water and supporting them with the help of a sling. 'It was freezing and hard to stand still just holding the whales,"" she says. ""The atmosphere was fairly positive and everyone is just trying to think of the bright side.""

Researchers from across Australia are baffled by the never-before-seen behaviour of the whales, who were grouped together in a heart shape in the hours leading up to the beaching.

""The fact they were in one area very huddled and doing really interesting behaviours and looking around at times suggests something else is going on that we just don’t know,"" says Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist at Macquarie University.

Analysing the clip, Pirotta says a whale may have been sick or the pod may have become disorientated – but it was unlikely they were trying to avoid predators.

Dr Olaf Meynecke, a whale researcher at Griffith University, says of all whales, dolphins and porpoises, pilot whales are most prone to mass strandings because of their strong emotional ties.

#whales #whalestranding #australia",2023-07-26 16:58:55,"It is just so heartbreaking that so many whales have beached themselves says local volunteer Kaysanne Knucke as rescuers try to save a pod of longfinned pilot whales after a mass beaching in Western Australia

Drone footage showed the moment the pod of almost 100 whales moved tightly together before becoming stranding at Cheynes beach about 60km 37 miles east of Albany on Tuesday evening

Knunckey along with other volunteers were waistdeep in the ocean from 730am until after 11am pulling the live mammals back into the water and supporting them with the help of a sling It was freezing and hard to stand still just holding the whales she says The atmosphere was fairly positive and everyone is just trying to think of the bright side

Researchers from across Australia are baffled by the neverbeforeseen behaviour of the whales who were grouped together in a heart shape in the hours leading up to the beaching

The fact they were in one area very huddled and doing really interesting behaviours and looking around at times suggests something else is going on that we just dont know says Dr Vanessa Pirotta a wildlife scientist at Macquarie University

Analysing the clip Pirotta says a whale may have been sick or the pod may have become disorientated  but it was unlikely they were trying to avoid predators

Dr Olaf Meynecke a whale researcher at Griffith University says of all whales dolphins and porpoises pilot whales are most prone to mass strandings because of their strong emotional ties

They are so closely bonded its almost like they are stressing each other out  It kind of makes sense given their strong emotional bonding to their peers he says

"Would you do something like this to get a job?

24-year-old banking and finance graduate Haider Malik was tired of online applications and Zoom interviews.

So he took his whiteboard - complete with QR codes for his CV and LinkedIn page - and stood in the middle of London's financial district outside Canary Wharf tube station.

He said it was inspired by his father, Mehmood Malik, a retired cab driver who came to the UK from Pakistan as a teenager to provide for his family.

""I decided to get out of my comfort zone and get some well needed human interaction,"" he said.

Malik said he felt really nervous at first but decided to start handing out CVs and wishing commuters a nice morning.

""I became more approachable and it was really noticed by the commuters. Within an hour I had given away all 50 of my CVs.""

Within two hours of being outside the tube station, Malik was interviewed for a job as a treasury analyst, he had a second interview by Friday and was given the job.

After going viral, Malik was shocked to hear back from recruiters about roles he'd applied for six months ago. ""It just shows that having reach and standing out is so important in the current recruitment process,"" he said.

He started his first day at Canary Wharf Group and is now looking to help students and graduates into entry-level jobs through events that ""bridge the gap between applicants and recruiters"".

"""There was no way I was going to pay for a woman walking in a bus lane with a funny T-shirt on ...""

David Knight baffled when he received a fine for driving in a bus lane in Bath, England about 120 miles away from his home.

But the builder and his wife, Paula, who live in Dorking, Surrey, laughed when they examined the evidence of their alleged infraction ... a photo showing a woman with the word “Knitter” on her T-shirt, which the computer had mixed up with Knight’s registration plate, KN19TER.

The private registration on his van is a nod to David's nickname, Knighter.

The alleged offence took place in June but Knight, 54, did not receive the penalty notice until last month.

Paula Knight, a bookkeeper, told the Daily Mail she contacted the council to alert officials to their mistake and they agreed to cancel the £90 fine.

She added that council call handler “burst out laughing” when she alerted her to the error, saying: “We’ve been laughing about it a lot. There was no way I was going to pay for a woman walking in a bus lane with a funny T-shirt on.”

"Rocko, pictured on the second slide of this gallery, is a disabled self-employed craftsman in Jamaica. He is one of the many people being featured in @dextermcleanphotography's first solo exhibition about his return to Olympic Gardens - where he spent his childhood before moving to Britain.

During his shoot Rocko decided to wear a T-shirt that has a picture of the current prime minister of Jamaica – Andrew Holness – to express his passion for politics.

The other portraits feature family, friends and characters of all ages - including McLean's father (slide 4) and his grandmother (slide 6) - alongside young locals who say they are finding job opportunities hard to come by.

McLean says his long-term ambition is to create a collective portrait documenting the disabled community in Jamaica, drawing on his own experience of living with cerebral palsy, to challenge historical representations of black and disabled communities.

"Relief, emotion and a sense of hope came flooding across Georgia, on social media, and throughout the US as the nation came to terms with the Ahmaud Arbery verdicts and their place in history.

For many observers, the high-profile case of the three white men convicted of murdering Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was out jogging, revealed the racist ways the American legal system has been designed to treat Black people differently.

Arbery was killed in February 2020 in the coastal town of Satilla Shores, Georgia. None of the men involved, Gregory McMichael, 67, his 35-year-old son, Travis McMichael, and their neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan, 52, were charged until eyewitness footage was made public months later, shortly before the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, prompting widespread protests.

Outside the courthouse in Brunswick yesterday, in front of a joyous, flag-waving crowd, Arbery’s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones (pictured on the penultimate slide with Rev Al Sharpton) said: “It’s been a long fight, it’s been a hard fight ... To tell you the truth I never saw this day. Back in 2020 I never thought this day would come … Thank you to those who marched, the ones who prayed, thank you.” 

She said her son “will now rest in peace”.

Arbery’s father, Marcus Arbery, thanked his son’s mother, and the activists and lawyers who helped draw attention to his son’s case. “God put us all together to make this happen,” he said. “We conquered that lynch mob. We got that lynch mob ...""

From the Oval Office, Joe Biden reflected on Arbery’s killing as a “devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country” but saw the trial’s outcome as a beacon of hope.

Outside court, civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton told the cheering crowd: “Brunswick, Georgia, will go down in history as the place where criminal justice took a different turn. Decades from now they’ll be talking about a boy called Ahmaud Arbery who taught this nation what justice looks like.”

"What would you call this young giraffe 🦒 ?

On each of the world’s tallest animals there is a unique pattern of patches, which researchers believe are inherited from their mother … They act as a form of camouflage in the wild and the skin under the spots also has a system of blood vessels that allows them to release heat through the center of each patch - a form of thermal regulation.

Except with this Tennessee newcomer …

The female giraffe, born on 31 July, is a uniform brown color, and is thought to be the world’s only singularly colored and spotless giraffe.
And now Brights zoo have announced a contest for the public to name the almost one-month-old animal, who is already 6ft tall.

The shortlisted options are Kipekee, which means “unique” in Swahili; Firayali, which means unusual; Shakiri, which means “she is most beautiful”; and Jamella, which is “one of great beauty”.

"""Octopuses and lobsters have feelings and should be included in the animal sentience bill"".

That is the argument put forward by a group of Conservative MPs who are part of the influential Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation.

The animal sentience bill, now at second reading stage in the House of Lords, recognises that fish and other vertebrates feel pain and should be protected, where possible, from suffering. However, the group of MPs has argued that some invertebrates are extremely intelligent and should be included in the bill.

A new report by the CAWF has found that the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million cephalopods and crustaceans each year. This is a total of 73,600 tonnes of crustaceans and 12,100 tonnes of cephalopods.

It is well known that octopuses are intelligent, and they have been found to be excellent at solving puzzles. The Netflix film My Octopus Teacher, released last year, brought the issue to a large audience, as hundreds of thousands of people were charmed by the relationship between human and inquisitive octopus.

The new animal sentience legislation will mean that any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy. This will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field.

"How would you describe this object?

Some have called it a “magnetic turd” and others have said it’s “amazing and a tiny bit terrifying.”

But its co-creator, Prof Li Zhang, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong says it is a ""magnetic slime robot"" that could be used in a medical setting.

And while the team have no immediate plans to do so, they envisage the slime could be useful in the digestive system, for example in reducing the harm from a small swallowed battery.

“The ultimate goal is to deploy it like a robot,” Zhang said.

The slime has “visco-elastic properties”, she said, meaning that “sometimes it behaves like a solid, sometimes it behaves like a liquid”.

The magnetic particles in the slime, however, are toxic themselves. The researchers coated the slime in a layer of silica – the main component in sand – to form a hypothetically protective layer.

“The safety [would] also strongly depend on how long you would keep them inside of your body,” Zhang said.

"Amber Heard's baby announcement has attracted huge attention - not only because of her celebrity - but because she is part of what seems to be a growing trend of women becoming single mothers by choice.

Heard is in a relationship with the cinematographer Bianca Butti, but is reportedly the sole legal parent of her daughter, Oonagh Paige Heard, who was born in April. The actor says she decided to get pregnant before meeting her partner.

“Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child,” Heard wrote in an Instagram post last Thursday. “I wanted to do it on my own terms. I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way. I hope we arrive at a point in which it’s normalised to not want a ring in order to have a crib.”

Statistics point to an increase in the number of IVF cycles undertaken by single women in the UK, and celebrities such as the musician Natalie Imbruglia have helped to normalise women choosing to have a child alone.

"In 1938, there was a surge of classified ads in the Guardian as Jewish parents living under Nazi rule tried to desperately save their families.

This included the grandparents of our world affairs editor, Julian Borger.

For a shilling a line, they posted an ad for Julian's father, Robert. “I seek a kind person who will educate my intelligent Boy, aged 11, Viennese of good family,” it read.

Two Welsh schoolteachers, Nancy and Reg Bingley, responded to the ad and fostered Robert through his teen years.

Robert's parents soon followed after they were able to find work and obtain visas in the UK.

For the Guardian's 200th birthday, Julian dug back into the ads, with the help from our archivist, bringing to light the stories of those who were able to escape, and those who weren't.

"""The evils of slavery cannot be forgotten. Nor can the wealth gained from it by a few – including the wealth gained by the institution of the monarchy – be forgotten.""

This was written by Jamaican politician Lisa Hanna in the Guardian as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge continued their Caribbean tour in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Queen's reign.

Politicians and protesters in Jamaica, Belize and the Bahamas – where William and Catherine have been visiting – are calling on the royals to apologise for their family's historical role in the slave trade. They are also calling for the removal of the Queen as their heads of state, and on Britain to pay reparations.

The Duke of Cambridge gave a speech in Jamaica expressing ""profound sorrow"" for the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"", but stopped short of the apology activists had demanded.

Hanna writes: ""When we in Jamaica say respect, we mean it. We respect you. We respect Prince William and Catherine. We respect the British people. We respect your leaders. When you visit Jamaica, we are polite to you. We are cordial to you. We give you the time of your life on holiday. We laugh with you. We cry with you. All we ask is for reciprocity by taking our advocacy seriously, and that together we can right the historical wrongs and reset the political, economic and social system for future generations.""

So how exactly has the British monarchy been historically involved with the transatlantic slave trade? Swipe to find out, and follow the link in bio to read Hanna's piece.

"“If I feel like that as a privileged man, I can’t imagine what day-to-day life is like for LGBT+ people around the Commonwealth.""

The Olympic diver Tom Daley has condemned homophobia across Commonwealth nations ahead of the start of competition in the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham today.

It is illegal to be gay in more than half of the 54 countries competing at the Games. While speaking up for athletes facing danger and discrimination, Daley says: “LGBT+ athletes must be safe and feel comfortable being their authentic selves without fear of persecution or death.”

“The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has been willing to talk and willing to hear what we have to say, and it’s good to see they’ve started taking a stance towards more inclusion.”

The Commonwealth Games Federation president, Dame Louise Martin, said: “We are proud to support Pride House and as ‘The Games for Everyone’ we believe that Birmingham 2022 will provide an inspiring and important opportunity to engage, champion and benefit many diverse communities, including the LGBTIQ+ sporting community.”

Daley will not be diving at this year’s Commonwealth Games as he is spending time with his family but he will be joining the opening ceremony where LGBT+ athletes will be able to wave the rainbow flag on the podium for the first time at the Games.

"Despite facing racism throughout his career, Wilston Samuel Jackson dedicated his life to railway. He has now been honoured at a ceremony in London.

The picture above shows his great-grandchildren Josiah, Lawrence and Sofia beneath the new blue plaque commemorating him as Britain’s first black train driver.

Speaking at the event yesterday, his daughter, Polly Jackson, said: “He was never late or missed a day, and he was so proud of his work, despite the many challenges he faced. Today was a fitting tribute to his life and career.”

Born in Jamaica, Jackson – who died in 2018 at the age of 91 – began maintaining trains shortly after moving to London in 1952 as part of the Windrush generation.

He went on to become a driver a decade later and had a long and successful career on the railway, including driving the famous Flying Scotsman locomotive and The Elizabethan.

Known as Bill, Jackson worked his way from a maintenance role to a position managing train boilers, which saw him spend the day shovelling coal in hot and filthy conditions. He would then return home to study for his driver exams.

His journey to becoming a train driver came at a time when many black people had their applications blocked due to racism, and Jackson’s appointment in 1962 sparked a furious reaction from some of his white colleagues, who unsuccessfully attempted to prevent white men from working under him.

Two years later, Jackson broke both his legs when his train crashed into the back of a stationary goods train near Finsbury Park after a signalman mistakenly gave a green light. After his recovery he returned to the railway, before later emigrating to Zambia where he taught people how to drive trains.

Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union, Aslef, said: “We are incredibly proud to have had Wilston as one of our own, a dedicated driver with an illustrious and groundbreaking career.”

Recent figures from Aslef revealed that only 10% of Britain’s train drivers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.

"This googly-eyed device is a scarecrow for the sea.

It has been created by scientists to help reduce the number of vulnerable seabirds caught by fishing nets.

Known as a looming-eyes buoy, the scarecrow uses bright eyespots and looming movements to act as a natural deterrent, preventing seabirds from diving into gillnets – vertical nets used in small-scale fisheries in many countries.

The scientists in charge found the device to reduce the numbers of birds by a quarter within a 50-metre radius of the buoy.

It is hoped the device, still in its prototype phase, will be tested in small-scale fisheries and help save thousands of seabirds each year.",2021-05-06 19:00:28,"This googlyeyed device is a scarecrow for the sea

"Suella Braverman says she has a “dream”. And what is it that she dreams of?

At a fringe event at the Tory party conference last week, the new home secretary said it was to see a newspaper front page with a picture of a plane taking off to Rwanda, deporting people from the UK.

Later the same day, in her first major speech in her new job, Braverman thanked Priti Patel for the “foundations” she had laid in toughening the immigration system.

In an opinion piece for The Guardian, academic and author Maya Goodfellow writes: ""Braverman said her “ultimate aspiration” was to reduce “net migration” by only allowing “immigration that grows our economy” – which means the “high-skilled” not the “low-skilled” kind.

""We already have a good idea of what this means: barring people from moving just because of their qualifications, class or how much money they have, while bringing in people deemed “economically necessary” to exploit them as long as it suits the ""British economy"".

Here @mayagoodfellow shares her thoughts on the key things we should know about Patel's successor.

"Republicans have won back control of the House of Representatives scraping a victory from a midterms election that many had expected to be a red wave of wins but which instead turned into more of a trickle.

Nevertheless, the party finally won its crucial 218th seat in the lower chamber of Congress, wresting away control from the Democrats and setting the stage for a showdown with Joe Biden in the next two years of his presidency.

The result means the end of Democrat Nancy Pelosi’s time as House speaker and is likely to pass the speaker’s gavel to Republican leader Kevin McCarthy who has announced his intention to take up the post.

Control of the House is crucial as it will allow the Republicans to launch an array of congressional investigations ranging from Biden’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan to more obviously politicized probes of government actions during the coronavirus pandemic and Biden’s son Hunter’s business activities.",2022-11-17 01:43:23,"Republicans have won back control of the House of Representatives scraping a victory from a midterms election that many had expected to be a red wave of wins but which instead turned into more of a trickle

"Soaring inflation, climate-driven disasters and war – to name a few current crisis – inflicted untold hardship on hundreds of millions of people across the world in 2022.

At the same time, on an unprecedented scale, the year was the most lucrative for the fossil fuel industry; the five largest western oil and gas companies alone made a combined $200bn in profits.

Shell recently announced a record annual profit of $40bn (£33bn), driven by the high energy prices resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine.

As @greenpeaceuk pointed out on Twitter, even by earning £40,000 per day, every day for the past 2026 years (roughly how long ago Jesus is said to have been born), you would earn £29.6bn.

Shell has suffered a flurry of recent legal and regulatory challenges, which includes a Dutch court order to cut emissions from its oil and gas by 45% by 2030. Shell is appealing the verdict.

Today it's been revealed that the directors of the oil giant Shell are being personally sued over their climate strategy, which the claimants say is inadequate to meet climate targets and puts the company at risk as the world switches to clean energy.

Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have filed the lawsuit against the 11 directors at the high court in England. It is the first case in the world seeking to hold corporate directors liable for failing to properly prepare their company for the net zero transition, ClientEarth said.

“Shell may be making record profits now, but the writing is on the wall for fossil fuels long term,” said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson.

A Shell spokesperson said: “We do not accept ClientEarth’s allegations. Our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the company. We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious [1.5C] goal of the Paris agreement ...""

"This is the first time a valuable chemical has been brewed from waste plastic.

Plastic bottles have been converted into vanilla flavouring using genetically engineered bacteria.

The research, published in the journal Green Chemistry, used engineered E coli bacteria to transform terephthalic acid (TA) into vanillin.

The scientists warmed a microbial broth to 37C for a day, the same conditions as for brewing beer. This converted 79% of the TA into vanillin.

Vanillin is used widely in the food and cosmetics industries and is an important bulk chemical used to make pharmaceuticals, cleaning products and herbicides.

Global demand is growing and in 2018 was 37,000 tonnes, far exceeding the supply from natural vanilla beans. About 85% of vanillin is currently synthesised from chemicals derived from fossil fuels

Currently plastics lose about 95% of their value as a material after a single use. Encouraging better collection and use of such waste is key to tackling the global plastic pollution problem.

Upcycling plastic bottles into more lucrative materials could make the recycling process far more attractive and effective.

About 1m plastic bottles are sold every minute around the world and just 14% are recycled. Currently even those bottles that are recycled can only be turned into opaque fibres for clothing or carpets.",2021-06-15 15:01:45,"This is the first time a valuable chemical has been brewed from waste plastic

"Bumble, the dating app where women make the first move, has this week temporarily closed all of its offices and given staff a paid week off to help them deal with 'collective burnout' and stress.

Its 700 employees worldwide have been told to focus on themselves and switch off.

A Bumble executive wrote on Twitter that founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd had ""correctly intuited our collective burnout"", adding that the break feels like a ""big deal"" as annual leave in the US is ""notoriously scarce"".

A spokeswoman for Bumble said a few customer support staff will be working, but will be given time off at a later date to ensure they get the break too.

Bumble says it has quite an unconventional office environment; employees have a free choice over the hours they work, as long as the work gets done - and their headquarters in Texas has a ""Mommy Bar"" which is described as a ""private lactation space"" by Ms Wolfe Herd, as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and blowouts.

"Wally Funk, 82, has achieved her lifelong dream to go to space, after sixty years of being denied the chance.

In the 1960s, Funk took part in the Women in Space Program, where she excelled in its rigorous training for female astronauts. But after it was abruptly shut down in 1962 she was forced to forge a new path as a trailblazing pilot.

Another chance came along fourteen years later, when NASA opened its astronaut applications up to women in 1976. Funk applied three times but was turned down each time.

But today she joined Jeff Bezos on his Blue Origin flight, and made history as the oldest person to go to space. After landing she said, “I want to go again, fast”.

Describing the experience, Funk said: “When I went up this morning the noise wasn’t quite as bad [as expected] and we went right on up and I saw darkness. I thought I was going to see the world but we weren’t quite high enough.

“I felt great, I felt like I was just laying down and I was going into space.”

After the disappointment of the 1960s, Funk went on to become a flight instructor. She said she had taught more than 3,000 people to fly. “I’ve always done everything on my own,” she said. “I didn’t do dolls, I did outside stuff and I flew airplanes, 19,000-something hours. I loved it.”

"“Our continent has many layers""

When artist @aidamuluneh was asked by @wateraid to participate in a campaign highlighting water poverty, it was the women of Afar, northern Ethiopia, that she shot for her series Water Life.

Muluneh, who was born in Addis Ababa, was pleased that the charity wanted to use art for advocacy rather than reportage.

“[Africa has] been at the mercy of the international media that does not show the complexities of our challenges. My approach has been to tell a story from my perspective, not based on cliches often covered by foreign photographers.”

With the help of a number of models, Muluneh has created a series of 12 works about the lack of access to clean water and sanitation. Swipe across to see a selection.

"What do you think it takes to be a good spy?

The British agency GCHQ has said apprentices on their scheme are four times more likely to have dyslexia than those on other organisations’ programmes - the result of a drive to recruit those whose brains process information differently.

GCHQ says those with dyslexia have valuable skills spotting patterns that others miss – a key area the spy agency wants to encourage as it pivots away from dead letter drops and bugging towards high-tech cybersecurity and data analysis.

“We’re looking for people who can see something that’s out of place in a bigger picture, who have good visual awareness and can spot anomalies,” said Jo Cavan, the director of strategy, policy and engagement at GCHQ.

“If they’re sifting through large amounts of data from a large number of sources to prevent a terrorist attack or a serious organised criminal, skills such as pattern recognition are key. A lot of dyslexic colleagues have those strengths.”

Cavan said that the agency has valued neurodiversity during its 100-year existence, with the second world war code-breaker Alan Turing its best known employee with dyslexia.

However, the shift to online defence and security prompted by the government’s integrated review in March will make dyslexic thinking skills an even bigger feature of GCHQ’s future, she said.

A report produced by the charity, Made by Dyslexia, with the consultancy EY suggested that some of the thinking skills people with dyslexia tend to be especially strong in include complex problem-solving, empathy, communication and critical thinking.

These are becoming increasingly valued in workplaces as AI and machine-learning mean that more routine tasks are automated, the authors said.",2021-04-30 21:00:08,"What do you think it takes to be a good spy

"How about this for innovation?

In what they claim is a world first, researchers have developed chopsticks that artificially create the taste of salt. 

The team behind the device hopes the utensils will find an especially receptive audience in Japan, where the traditional diet tends to be high in sodium due to the use of ingredients such as miso and soy sauce.

The average Japanese adult consumes about 10 grams of salt a day, double the amount recommended by the World Health Organization.

Homei Miyashita, a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, whose laboratory helped to develop the device said they plan to refine the prototype and hope to make the chopsticks available to consumers next year.

"She was ‘talked about like a possession’. 

Scarlett Johansson has spoken out against the sexualisation of Black Widow in Iron Man 2, the 2010 blockbuster in which her character first appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series.

Speaking to Collider, in the run-up to the release of the standalone Black Widow film, Johansson appears to be referring to the scene in Iron Man 2 when, as Natalie Rushman, Black Widow meets Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) for the first time. After flicking through a series of pictures of Rushman, including one of the character in lingerie, Stark tells Gwyneth Paltrow’s Pepper Potts: “I want one.” 

Johansson praised the “move away from the kind of hypersexualisation of this character” in the new Black Widow film, which co-stars Florence Pugh and is directed by Cate Shortland.

Cook was the only transgender person to speak before a parliamentary inquiry examining a proposed bill to ban the promotion of “gender fluidity” in schools.

The vice-president of the Australian Professional Association for Trans Health (AusPATH) told the inquiry that transgender youth were happier and performed better if their schools were supportive and used their correct names and pronouns.

"Has The Simpsons predicted the future again? 🐡

In what looks like it could only have come from the nuclear lake in The Simpsons, an angler has caught the world's largest goldfish.

Andy Hackett caught the 30kg leather carp-koi hybrid, aptly named the Carrot, in Bluewater Lakes in Champagne, France.

That's nearly as heavy as five bowling balls.

It was put into the lake 20 years ago, and has proved to be a slippery customer ever since.

Hackett, from Kidderminster in Worcestershire, reportedly spent 25 minutes bringing the fish in.

It is a hybrid species of a leather carp and koi, and is thought to be the second largest of its type ever caught.

42-year-old Hackett said: “I always knew the Carrot was in there but never thought I would catch it.

“I knew it was a big fish when it took my bait and went off side to side and up and down with it. Then it came to the surface 30 or 40 yards out and I saw that it was orange.

“It was brilliant to catch it but it was also sheer luck.”

"“We actually opened the doors for lots of people … Ah, we had so much fun!”

This is what Reggie Mcgoon – or Nana Reggie – remembers when she first started expressing her identity as a trans woman freely after taking inspiration from the celebration of a third gender in traditional Fijian culture.

The iTaukei term “vakasalewalewa” refers to people assigned male at birth but who have a feminine gender expression and whose identity as both is celebrated – something that changed after Britain colonised Fiji in 1874.

Mcgoon remembers at school she was told off by teachers for always playing with the girls and there was no discussion of alternative gender identities.

“People wouldn’t talk about it because it was a big taboo, because it’s instilled into young people’s minds because this is a Christian country, and we shouldn’t talk about these things.”

“Vakasalewalewa is a term that we are continuously reclaiming unapologetically in recognition of our rich history, traditions and our right to exist,” says Sulique Waqa, founder of Haus of Khameleon, a Fiji-based movement advocating for transgender equality in the Pacific.

"A UK startup is hoping to develop an ultra-quiet, bioelectric plane that will help in the fight against climate change. 

Faradair is working on a short-hop 18-seat plane that will use electric motors to power take-off and landing, the part of any flight with the highest noise and carbon emissions.

Once cruising, at a speed of about 230mph, the plane, known as the Beha,  will switch to its turbogenerator, powered by biofuel, which will also recharge the motors with assistance from solar panels, ready for the aircraft’s descent.

It will be the first aircraft produced since the 1920s to have a three-winged box design. It will be able to convert from passenger to cargo in just 15 minutes because of its palletised interior.

While the creators are hopeful the plane will be carbon neutral eventually, going all electric straight away was not going to be possible, and the Beha will go hybrid to begin with, using sustainable aviation fuels.

The hope is to have the Beha flying passengers by 2026, in which case, you’ll have to keep your eyes peeled, as your ears won’t be of much use in locating this ultra-quiet plane.",2021-03-18 22:00:58,"A UK startup is hoping to develop an ultraquiet bioelectric plane that will help in the fight against climate change

"What do you think of these ""skybrators""? 

They are a new bladeless wind turbine that can generate clean energy without the environmental impact of large windfarms - and they have been creating quite a buzz online.

Green energy pioneers, based just outside Madrid, Spain, have drawn up a turbine design that can harness energy from winds without the sweeping white blades considered synonymous with wind power.

It has already raised eyebrows on social media, where the turbine has been likened to a giant vibrating sex toy, or “skybrator”.

The bladeless turbines stand at 3 metres high, a curve-topped cylinder fixed vertically with an elastic rod. To the untrained eye it appears to waggle back and forth, not unlike a car dashboard toy. In reality, it is designed to oscillate within the wind range and generate electricity from the vibration.

The turbines' inventor, David Yáñez, says its unusual technology and design can help fill the gaps where traditional windfarms might not be appropriate - for example in urban and residential areas where the impact of a windfarm would be too great and the space to build one would be too small.

The turbine is no danger to bird migration patterns, or wildlife, particularly if used in urban settings. For the people living or working nearby, the turbine would create noise at a frequency virtually undetectable to humans.

"""A milestone for equality""

Swiss voters have decided by a clear margin to legalise marriage for same-sex couples in a referendum on Sunday - making it one of the last countries in Western Europe to do so.

Official results showed the measure passed with 64.1% of voters in favour and won a majority in all of Switzerland’s 26 cantons - the country's administrative provinces.

Switzerland’s parliament and the governing federal council supported the “Marriage for All” measure, and pre-referendum polls showed solid backing. The country has authorised same-sex civil partnerships since 2007.

Supporters said approval would put same-sex partners on an equal legal footing with heterosexual couples by allowing them to adopt children together and facilitating citizenship for same-sex spouses. It would also permit lesbian couples to use regulated sperm donation.

Amnesty International welcomed the move as a “milestone for equality”.

The Alpine nation, which has a population of 8.5 million, is traditionally conservative and only extended full voting rights to women in federal elections in 1971, with one canton holding out on full voting rights for municipal elections until 1990.

The latest same-sex referendum result is welcome news, but the topic does continue to divide the continent. Most countries in western Europe already recognise same-sex marriage, but most of those in central and Eastern Europe do not allow wedlock involving two men or two women.

Switzerland is the world’s 30th country to adopt same-sex marriages.

"Donald Trump turned himself in at a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday, an extraordinary scene that marks the first time in American history a former US president has faced criminal charges.

Trump, the leading contender for the 2024 Republican nomination, arrived at the lower Manhattan courthouse at about 1pm ET, escorted by Secret Service agents, as supporters and protesters demonstrated outside.

He was set to be arraigned, fingerprinted and possibly photographed. Though defendants charged with felonies are typically handcuffed, Trump’s legal team has said he would not be.

The unprecedented proceedings were slated to be brief but remarkable, as the twice-impeached former president learns the indictment against him, and, as expected, enters a plea of not guilty to charges related to his role in a hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels, made days before the 2016 election.

“There’s a lot of mystery here because we’re doing something that’s never been done before,” Joe Tacopina, a Trump lawyer, told ABC’s Good Morning America on Tuesday.

After the arraignment, Trump plans to return to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, where his campaign has scheduled a primetime news event with hundreds of high-profile supporters and possibly some of his most loyal allies on Capitol Hill.

"Do you recognise this sculpture? A little a least?

The life-size bronze artwork is based on Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa - and has just gone on public display in Bristol ... butt has already divided some opinion among art-lovers.

The 'Moona Lisa' is a reimagined version of acclaimed street artist Nick Walker's spray painting on the same subject, as seen on the second slide, which sold for £54,000 at London’s Bonhams auction house in 2008.

Walker created the original painting in response to a challenge from Banksy - a fellow artist and Bristolian - who said nothing more could be done with the Mona Lisa.

To create the 3D piece, a rig comprising of 160 DSLR cameras was constructed which captured a 360 image of a live model dressed as the Moona Lisa.

From this image a digital model was created which was then used as the mould for the final bronze sculpture.

The 260kg piece can be found at the @vanguardstreetart at the M Shed (@bristolmuseums) until 31 October, a show that celebrates the role Bristol's artists have played in the development of British street art.

"Warm-blooded animals are getting larger beaks, legs and ears to adapt to a hotter climate and to better regulate their temperature.

When animals overheat, birds use their beaks and mammals use their ears to disperse the warmth. Some creatures in warmer climates have historically evolved to have larger beaks or ears to get rid of heat more easily. These differences are becoming more pronounced as the climate warms.

If animals fail to control their body temperature, they can overheat and die. Beaks, which are not covered by feathers and therefore not insulated, are a site of significant heat exchange, as are ears, tails and legs in mammals if not covered by fur.

The review, published in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution, found that the differences are particularly pronounced in birds.

The author of the study, Sara Ryding of Deakin university, a bird researcher, said: “Shapeshifting does not mean that animals are coping with climate change and that all is fine.

“It just means they are evolving to survive it – but we’re not sure what the other ecological consequences of these changes are, or indeed that all species are capable of changing and surviving.”

While the scientists say it is difficult to pinpoint climate breakdown as the sole cause of the shapeshifting, it is what the instances studied have in common across geographical regions and across a diverse array of species.

Examples include several species of Australian parrot that have shown a 4-10% increase in bill size since 1871, positively correlated with the summer temperature each year.

"This time last year, NHS bosses asked doctors and nurses to ‘wear aprons’ and work without protective full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients, as hospitals were within hours of running out of supplies.

This is just one example of how the UK government has been slammed for its handling of the pandemic, through a series of missteps, U-turns, lockdowns, denials – and more than 150,000 deaths.

Twelve months on, the Guardian's Pamela Duncan looks at three major areas where officials were out of line with the data on coronavirus infections and deaths available at the time.

A government spokesperson responded, saying: ‘Throughout the pandemic, our approach has been guided by data and the advice of scientific and medical experts … As new evidence emerged, we acted quickly and decisively to implement life-saving measures, including restrictions and lockdowns, to protect lives, livelihoods and our economy. We are doing everything we can to ensure care home residents and staff are protected, including providing more than 9.9 billion items of PPE to the frontline.’

They include close friends, professional boxers, and even a man with 18 grandchildren she bumped into at the market.

“This photo project is something I’m really drawn to because of my relationship with my dad,” says Osubu. Her father passed away in 2017, while she was shooting her debut film Dear Philadelphia.

“This is my most vulnerable project because it’s specifically about a relationship and a person I miss. It felt like an honour to be able to spend time with all these different dads.”

"Greta Thunberg has slammed global leaders over their promises to address the climate emergency, dismissing them as “blah, blah, blah”.

In a speech to the Youth4Climate summit in Milan, Italy, today Thunberg quoted statements by UK prime minister, Boris Johnson: “This is not some expensive, politically correct, green act of bunny hugging”, and Narendra Modi: “Fighting climate change calls for innovation, cooperation and willpower” but said the science did not lie.

“Of course we need constructive dialogue,” said @gretathunberg. “But they’ve now had 30 years of blah, blah, blah and where has that led us? We can still turn this around – it is entirely possible. It will take immediate, drastic annual emission reductions. But not if things go on like today. Our leaders’ intentional lack of action is a betrayal toward all present and future generations.”

The Cop26 climate summit starts in Glasgow, UK, on 31 October and all the big-polluting countries must deliver tougher pledges to cut emissions to keep the goal of 1.5C within reach.

Carbon emissions are on track to rise by 16% by 2030, according to the UN, rather than fall by half, which is the cut needed to keep global heating under the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C.

Research published on Monday showed that children born today would experience many times more extreme heatwaves and other climate disasters over their lifetimes than their grandparents, even if countries fulfil their current emissions pledges.

Thunberg, @vanessanakate1 from Uganda, and hundreds of other young people from across the world are attending the Youth4Climate Summit. It is hosted by the Italian government, the UK’s partner in running Cop26.

Thunberg said: “They invite cherry-picked young people to meetings like this to pretend that they listen to us. But they clearly don’t listen to us. Our emissions are still rising. The science doesn’t lie.

“We can no longer let the people in power decide what is politically possible. We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive. Hope is not blah, blah, blah. Hope is telling the truth. Hope is taking action. And hope always comes from the people.”",2021-09-28 21:00:41,"Greta Thunberg has slammed global leaders over their promises to address the climate emergency dismissing them as blah blah blah

"When @gxorgewestwood was diagnosed with HIV at 19, he thought it was a ‘death sentence’.

But in the UK, effective treatment means those living with HIV are expected to live as long as anyone else - and four decades after the first cases of Aids were discovered, the treatment available here stops the virus from developing or being passed on to others.

For George, education is the best way to support people with HIV because he says: ‘having the same conversation about your HIV status is draining’.

"From @guardianaustralia: residents and business owners in the beachside town of Byron Bay in New South Wales have been protesting against a proposed Netflix series, Byron Baes.

The streaming platform has described the show as “a docu-soap series following a ‘feed’ of hot Instagrammers living their best lives, being their best selves, creating the best [drama] content. #nofilter guaranteed.”

But locals have been calling for the show to be cancelled and have held an emergency meeting to discuss what could be done to protect the community.

Delta Kay, an Arakwal Bumberin Bundjalung traditional owner, said: ""We have huge environmental issues, huge social issues here ... I don’t want these influencers coming here and painting this fantasy picture that all is well in Byron Bay. It isn’t.”

Others have raised concerns the show would paper over the housing crisis that the town is now facing - as well as worries the impact that rebranding Byron as a “social media place” could have on local kids.

Netflix’s director of content for Australia and New Zealand said that “the reason behind choosing Byron Bay as a location was driven by the area’s unique attributes as a melting pot of entrepreneurialism, lifestyle and health practices, and the sometimes uneasy coming together of the traditional ‘old Byron’ and the alternative ‘new’, all of which we’ll address in the series.”

"“I wanted to make trans people feel loved, supported and safe. That’s all I was trying to do,” says Riz Possnett after protesting the gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock’s talk at the University of Oxford.

This week footage of the trans activist glueing themself to the debating chamber close to the speaker’s chair was shared across social media.

The demonstration temporarily halted Stock’s speech, as the police removed the activist - but Possnett says they didn’t want to stop the talk, only ‘disrupt it’.

“I respect Kathleen’s right to free speech, but I’m also painfully aware of the consequences her speeches have on trans people in the UK,” says Possnett.

Stock, who argues that transgender people cannot expect all the rights afforded by biological sex, had been speaking over the sound of up to 200 people protesting outside about her invitation when a group of activists stormed the debating chamber on Tuesday. During the event, Stock insisted she was not anti-trans despite what her critics said.

According to Possnett, many students didn’t want Stock speaking at their university - with the student union and elected committee voting to condemn the Union’s invitation of the academic.

Students had organised a trans pride to take place on campus to protest Stock’s speech and celebrate trans lives but Possnett felt like they needed to do something more.

"'It’s taught me more about what I enjoy’

More and more people are choosing to go without sex. And, in many cases, they’ve never been happier.

Take Caitlin. She didn’t set out to become celibate – at least not in the beginning. Three years ago, she was coming out of an abusive relationship and wasn’t ready to meet someone else.

“I thought during that time I needed space to heal and reflect on what I’d been through,” she says.

Caitlin’s celibacy, three years in now, became intentional. “It’s taught me more about what I enjoy in sex, which I wasn’t expecting. I thought it was going to put me at a disadvantage, but I feel a lot more confident in my own sexuality,” she says.

Voluntary, or intentional, celibacy has become increasingly popular. In January, it was reported that there was a 90% increase in Google searches for celibacy that month.

However, this isn’t a short-term fad, says Dr Justin Lehmiller, a Kinsey Institute research fellow and host of the Sex and Psychology podcast. “Humans are increasingly less sexually active, with some forgoing sex altogether.”

"Inspired by the great Romantic painters and American landscape photography, Im Wald – meaning 'in the forest' – portrays people in isolation, while at the same time staging them in visually astounding settings.

The new series of photos by Dutch photographer Erwin Olaf hopes to highlight our relationship with nature - while raising questions about both the present and future. They draw attention to global issues including the climate crisis and immigration - and celebrate individualism, human emotion and the wonder of our environment.

Shot on location in the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, @studioerwinolaf says he deliberately used a black and white palette for the series to emphasise the brute force and indifference of our world. The vastness of the landscape in comparison to the subjects is dramatised by the scale of the images.

"This year’s World Cup is considered the most controversial in history. But why?

Qatar is facing serious allegations that this tournament has been built on exploitation.

For the last ten years - we’ve been investigating the treatment of the tens of thousands of migrant workers who have been building Qatar’s World Cup stadiums and infrastructure ever since they won the bid to host the tournament in 2010.

In this video, human rights journalist Annie Kelly looks back at four crucial stories that helped spotlight migrant workers’ rights in Qatar.

And you can read more testimonies directly from the migrant workers who made this World Cup possible by clicking the link in our bio.

Journalist Pete Pattison has been listening to their stories since Fifa awarded Qatar the rights to host the tournament.

For months, he traced the bodies of dozens of migrant workers repatriated from Qatar back to their families to try to establish why they never made it home alive.

"'There is more to life than just gymnastics.'

The American gymnast Simone Biles, the biggest star at the Tokyo Olympics and the greatest athlete in the sport’s history, has withdrawn from the women’s all-around gymnastics final.

The news followed her dramatic decision to stop competing in the women’s team event on Tuesday after one rotation on the vault, citing mental health concerns.

After withdrawing from the event, Biles admitted that she had struggled with the demands of being one of the most famous athletes in the world, the unique pressure of these Games and the added challenge of being stuck in a Covid secure bubble:

""I say put mental health first because if you don't then you aren't going to enjoy your sport and you aren't going to succeed as much as you want to.

""So, it's OK sometimes to even sit out the big competitions to focus on yourself because it shows how strong of a competitor and person you really are.""

Her decision has been widely praised by America’s sporting superstars, with Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, among those insisting that it would “blow the doors open” over athletes mental health; “I hope this is an opportunity for us to jump on board, and to even blow this mental health thing even more wide open. It is so much bigger than we can ever imagine.""

US gymnastics said Biles will be evaluated before deciding if she will participate in next week’s individual events.

"SpaceX’s futuristic Starship looked like it aced a touchdown Wednesday, but then exploded on the landing pad with so much force that it was hurled into the air.

The failure occurred just minutes after SpaceX declared success. The landing was at least better than the last two times, where the prototypes crash-landed in fireballs in previous test flights.

The full-scale prototype of Elon Musk’s envisioned Mars ship soared more than six miles after lifting off from the southern tip of Texas on Wednesday. It descended horizontally over the Gulf of Mexico and then flipped upright just in time to land.

The shiny bullet-shaped rocketship remained intact this time at touchdown, prompting the SpaceX commentator John Insprucker to declare, “third time’s a charm as the saying goes” before SpaceX ended its webcast of the test.

But then the Starship exploded and was tossed in the air, before slamming down into the ground in flames.

A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year’s end. Musk has said he intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with the Starship in 2023.

"At a stable in rural New York, traumatized soldiers and horses are teaching each other to leave the past behind.

The photograph above is of Phil Wytrwa, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, and wild mustang, Tango at the EquiCenter, a therapeutic equestrian facility.

There, under the supervision of a horse trainer, Wytrwa is one of 16 veterans who have sought reprieve from post-traumatic stress among one of the most unpredictable animals: wild mustangs.

The stable runs a program that matches veterans with mustangs to train in hopes the animals can be adopted or utilized as therapeutic partners. Training the horses serves as a kind of therapy, helping veterans rebuild their own confidence, focus and sense of purpose.

Wytrwa described a life transformed by this work. When he returned from Afghanistan, symptoms of PTSD hounded his daily life: flashbacks made it impossible to work and his depression was incapacitating.

“It has helped me immensely,” he said. By focusing on taking care of the animals, he says he was able to become better at taking care of himself. Over time he became more patient, more present with his fiancée and children. “It’s the horses – they did this. They did all of it,” Wytrwa added.

Luann Van Peursem, who received the Air Force commendation medal for saving two men during a rocket attack in Iraq, is pictured on slide five. She first started coming for riding lessons in 2014 when nightmares, flashbacks and depression were consuming her life. “Coming back from Iraq, you just don’t have a lot of trust in mankind, and you just kind of isolate,” she said.

Working with a frightened animal forces the veterans’ nervous behavior to shift in the opposite direction: Confidence and calm are necessary to put the horse at ease. “That connection lets your anxiety relax – because the horses feed off of you. If you’re tight, they’re going to be tight,” Van Peursem said. Her work with the horses has been so helpful that she went so far as to say, “I wouldn’t be alive without it.”

"“The horned crocodile-faced hell heron” is one of two exciting new species of dinosaur to have been unearthed off the coast of England.

Found on the Isle of Wight, the 125 million-year-old predator, officially named Ceratosuchops inferodios, had a 9 metre-long body, powerful claws, a gigantic skull covered in horns and bumps, and long crocodile-like teeth.

The fearsome creature lived on the fringes of ancient floodplains where it would have lain in wait for aquatic prey, research suggests.

Scientists say the discovery, along with the skeleton of a second species at the same site, offers unique insights into how the Spinosauridae family of dinosaurs made the transition from land-dwelling to semi-aquatic predators over a period of tens of millions of years.

“This is a really exciting piece of news for the dinosaur world as these are some of the most charismatic and enigmatic predators,” said Neil Gostling of the University of Southampton, who supervised the project.

The new finds also cemented the Isle of Wight’s status as the best place in Europe to find dinosaurs, he added.

“The fact they have these crocodile-like teeth, which are good for catching slippery fish, means we suspect they were standing in the water and using their jaws to hunt,” said Gostling.

Another possibility is that the dinosaurs would have waited, semi-submerged, like a crocodile, or used their large claws to hook fish out of the water like a bear.

This feline seemingly used one up here surviving a dramatic fall after somehow getting into Miami Gardens, the University of Miami's stadium, for a college football match. 

The cat was filmed dangling from an upper stand for a couple of seconds. As the crowd looked on, some quick thinking spectators thankfully used an American flag as a makeshift net to cushion the animal's fall.

The stadium tweeted after the event saying 'we wish the cat the best in its remaining eight lives'.

"Mexico’s supreme court has decriminalized abortion across the country, two years after ruling that abortion was not a crime in one northern state.

That earlier ruling had set off a grinding process of decriminalizing abortion state by state. Last week, the central state of Aguascalientes became the 12th state to decriminalize the procedure.

The court’s decision is part of a growing trend across Latin America, and is in stark contrast to the nationwide rollback of reproductive rights currently underway in the US.

Mexico City was the first Mexican jurisdiction to decriminalize abortion 15 years ago.

"Have you heard of Manx Gaelic?

It's the rarest language in England and Wales according to the latest census - so you'll be forgiven if you haven't...

But if you take a trip to the Isle of Man, which is located in the Irish Sea between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, you're far more likely to have heard it, because this is where Manx Gaelic originates.

For centuries, Manx, which is part of the Celtic language family like Irish and Scottish Gaelic, was how people on the island communicated.

By the 19th century however, the English language took over - and by 2009 Unesco declared it extinct, which was soon corrected to ‘critically endangered’ after outcry from the Manx language community.

Because the Isle of Man is not part of the UK – but is a self-governing crown dependency with its own parliament, government and laws – it has its own census.

And Manx is continuing to grow in popularity year on year, with over 120 years of support from the community, and residents on the island are using music, schooling, and the internet to bring back their ancestors’ mother tongue.

We spoke to Ruth Keggin Gell from Culture Vannin. She teaches Manx and is a part of the movement keeping Manx alive.

"Picture your day before you started to read this: what did you do?

In every single moment – getting out of bed, turning on a tap, flicking the kettle switch – your brain was blasted with information.

Each second, the eyes will give the brain the equivalent of 10m bits (binary digits) of data. The ears will take in an orchestra of sound waves. Then there’s our thoughts: the average person, researchers estimate, will have more than 6,000 a day. To get anything done, we have to filter out most of this data. We have to focus.

Focusing has felt particularly tough during the pandemic.

Books are left half-read; eyes wander away from Zoom calls; conversations stall. My inability to concentrate on anything – work, reading, cleaning, cooking – without being distracted over the past 18 months has felt, at times, farcical.

The good news? We can learn to focus better, but we need to think about attention differently. It is not something we can just choose to do. We have to train the brain like a muscle. Specifically, with short bursts of daily exercises.

Dr Amishi Jha - a professor of cognitive and behavioural neuroscience at the University of Miami - has written a book called Peak Mind: Find Your Focus, Own Your Attention, Invest 12 Minutes a Day, a four-week training programme based on her research showing how simple mindfulness exercises carried out by people with high-demand jobs, such as soldiers, elite athletes and emergency medics, improve many aspects of cognitive and emotional health, including strengthening our attention.

She spoke to Guardian contributor and trainee psychotherapist Eleanor Morgan about five things we can do to focus better.

"""It's wonderful to see how this one historical event has influenced us two, three generations on”, says Kamau Johnston, grandchild of an Empire Windrush passenger from Jamaica.

Kamau is one of four grandchildren of the Windrush generation who spoke to the Guardian about how the arrival of almost 500 people from the Caribbean to the UK, 75 years ago changed the country for the better and why it should be celebrated.

In 1948, from Kingston, Jamaica to Tilsbury Docks, the ship brought over 492 West Indian passengers – a postwar generation that helped rebuild the UK and paved the way for others to follow.

Five years ago, the Windrush scandal revealed how decades after arriving in Britain, Caribbean-born UK residents have been wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights. “When the whole world was against them, the did this amazing thing despite of that,” said Kellie Brothwood, whose grandfather was Trinidadian, “and that's the reason why we're here today”.

Kamau and Kellie were joined by Bianca Judd whose Trinidadian grandfather served in the British airforce, and Dane Gardner whose grandad was a passenger on Empire the Windrush from Jamaica. This is why they want their families to be remembered.

"""I spent years hiding myself""

New Australian MP Stephen Bates was met with cheers and hugs after giving his first speech to parliament earlier this week.

In an emotional address on Wednesday, the Greens MP said working in poverty-wage jobs and coming out as gay were ""pivotal moments"" that shaped him and his politics.

Holding back tears, Bates recounted the difficulties he faced as a young, gay man in Queensland, saying: ""... I spent years hiding myself because I could not see anyone in my world that was openly gay.

""I made a promise to myself once I came out. That if I ever found myself in a public role that I would be open and proud of who I am.""

He added that “if I can help even one person out there, that my life will have been worth it”.

"Have you been to puppy yoga? 🐶

This “wellness” trend is on the rise and is exactly what it sounds like – a yoga sessions with puppies!

But Esme Wheeler, the RSPCA’s dog welfare expert, is very concerned about the activity because it is an “overwhelmingly negative experience for the dogs”.

“To strip a puppy of their choice and control at a formative stage of their development creates a basis for future problems, which are common reasons for animals to be given to rehoming centres,” she says.

If you love dogs and want to spend more time with them, Wheeler recommends volunteering at an animal shelter or helping a friend with walking their pet over taking part in puppy yoga.

In this video, she talks about three ways that puppy yoga can be harmful to dogs.

"Cambodian authorities have confiscated a defanged and declawed pet lion that appeared in TikTok videos taken at a villa in the wealthy Boeung Keng Kang district of the capital Phnom Penh.

The owner had shared a photo of the lion sitting in a driveway as a dog played nearby. There was also a video of it as a young cub being sprayed down with a hose. The confiscation comes a day after a Twitter user posted an aerial shot of the creature roaming around a garden.

Wildlife Alliance, an animal rescue non-government organisation that helped with the raid, said the conditions of a private residence were “inappropriate for a wild animal”. “In addition, the lion’s canine teeth had been removed, along with its claws, which drastically reduces a lion’s quality of life,” it said.

The 18-month-old male, weighing 70kg (154lbs), had been imported from overseas by the owner, a Chinese national, to be raised in his home, environment ministry spokesman Neth Pheaktra said.

“Cambodian authorities started investigating this lion since we saw it on TikTok in late April,” Pheaktra said on Sunday. “People have no right to raise rare wildlife as pets.”

The animal will now be moved to the Phnom Tamao wildlife rescue centre on the outskirts of the capital.

"Just what the doctor ordered?

Research has found that spending just two hours in nature per week significantly boosts health and wellbeing ... And so in Canada this is being made part of treatment plans for both physical and mental health.

Parks Canada, the agency that manages the country’s 38 national parks and ten national park reserves, is collaborating with Canada's national nature prescription programme PaRx to allow registered healthcare professionals to provide a free annual passes to patients.

The pass would usually cost $72 CAD ($57 USD) per adult for a year of unlimited access to national parks, but this initiative would allow some doctors to prescribe them for free.

“So this is all about breaking down those barriers to access to nature,” PaRx director Dr. Melissa Lem told Global News.

“There’s this huge body of research showing that nature time can improve all kinds of different physical and mental health conditions, from diabetes and heart disease to ADHD and depression,” she explained.

The PaRx program is aiming to be nationwide by the end of 2022 and has already signed up over 1,000 prescribers.

"This is Aditi Shankar and she’s received the UK’s first rejection free kidney … and it was given by her mum!

In a pioneering treatment, eight-year-old Aditi has been spared from taking life-long drugs to stop her body rejecting her kidney transplant.

Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital say the breakthrough was made possible by “reprogramming” Aditi Shankar’s immune system with stem cells before giving her the new kidney.

Because the bone marrow transplant and kidney came from the same donor – her mother – the new kidney is working without the need for drugs that stop the body from rejecting a donated organ.

Aditi is nowable to swim, sing, dance and play on her trampoline.

“My mum gave me my new blood cells,” said Aditi. “I got the kidney transplant when I went to special sleep and closed my eyes. Now I have got the line out, I can go swimming.”

Aditi’s favourite class in school is science and she has a keen interest in biology after learning so much about the human body during her time in hospital.

Her father, Uday, 48, said: “Most of the support for the family has come from Aditi. She was going in for six to eight hours a day of dialysis and then she would come home and still light the whole house up.”

"Despite how big, or small, Antartica looks on a map it's actually about 1.3 times as large as Europe and almost double the size of Australia.

Now scientists say the hole in the ozone layer and is this year bigger than the size of the continent.

Ozone exists about seven to 25 miles (11-40km) above the Earth’s surface, in the stratosphere, and acts like a sunscreen for the planet, shielding it from ultraviolet radiation.

Researchers from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, who are responsible for monitoring the hole, which develops annually, said it is “rather larger than usual”.

Every year, a hole forms during the late winter of the southern hemisphere as the sun causes ozone-depleting reactions, which involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from human-made compounds.

Vincent-Henri Peuch, the service’s director, told the Guardian: “The 2021 ozone hole is now among the 25% largest in our records since 1979, but the process is still under way.""

""A large or small ozone hole in one year does not necessarily mean that the overall recovery process is not going ahead as expected, but it can signal that special attention needs to be paid and research can be directed to study the reasons behind a specific ozone hole event.”

Scientists accept that the depletion in the ozone layer is caused by human-made gases called CFCs, which were first developed in the 1930s for use in refrigeration systems and were then deployed as propellants in aerosol spray cans.

Last month, separate research found these ozone-wrecking chemicals would have driven 2.5C of extra warming by 2100 if they had not been outlawed and that banning them has given us a fighting chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C as set out by the Paris agreement.

CFCs have been banned in 197 countries around the world - and since then the ozone layer has shown signs of recovery, but it is a slow process and it is is expected to take until the 2060s or 70s for a complete phasing-out of the depleting substances.

The constitutional court in Italy has ruled that children in the country should be given the surnames of both parents.

The ruling overturns the tradition of automatically naming all newborns after their fathers, a practice the court said was “discriminatory and harmful to the identity” of the child.

Children should be given both parents’ surnames in the order they decide, unless they agree their children should take just one of them, the court added in a statement.

Any new legislation needs to be approved by parliament to implement the decision, but the family minister, Elena Bonetti, said on Facebook that the government would fully support parliament in this process, adding that parents should take equal responsibility for the upbringing of a child.

Pope Francis and Italy’s political leaders have expressed concerns about the impact of a declining birth rate on the country, with the cost of raising children seen as one of the factors.

"It's being hailed as a 'breakthrough for science'.

The World Health Organization has recommended the widespread rollout of the first malaria vaccine, in a move experts hope could save tens of thousands of children’s lives each year across Africa.

Calling it “an historic day”, the WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that after a successful pilot programme in three African countries the RTS,S vaccine should be made available more widely.

The RTS,S vaccine, also known as Mosquirix, was developed by the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and has been administered to more than 800,000 children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi since the pilot programme began in 2019.

“Using this vaccine in addition to existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year,” said Tedros on Wednesday. “It is safe. It significantly reduces life-threatening, severe malaria, and we estimate it to be highly cost-effective.”

He added: “Malaria has been with us for millennia, and the dream of a malaria vaccine has been a long-held, but unattainable dream. Today, the RTS,S malaria vaccine, more than 30 years in the making, changes the course of public health history. We still have a very long road to travel. But this is a long stride down that road.”

Noting the role played by GSK in the development of the RTS,S vaccine, Gareth Jenkins, director of advocacy at the charity Malaria No More, called on the UK government to continue to invest in cutting-edge research that could “finally bring about a zero-malaria world”.

There have been fears that decades of progress towards ending malaria has stalled, with some countries, such as Eritrea and Sudan, seeing significant resurgences in recent years. In 2019, 409,000 people died from the mosquito-borne parasite disease, most of them in Africa. More than 270,000 of the victims were children under five.

Experts hope the WHO’s announcement will re-energise the race to find other vaccines, a quest that has been going on for almost a century.

"Photographer Dmitry Kokh travelled to Lake Baikal in Siberia – the world's deepest and oldest freshwater lake – determined to capture the ""magical world below the ice"".

He says taking pictures of Baikal seals – known locally as nerpa – in their natural environment is something few people have done.

""Baikal seals are normally very shy, but the young ones are the exception. Nerpa females give birth in March, in snow-covered burrows on the ice,"" @master.blaster writes in his new Guardian photo essay.

""Newborn pups are covered with white fur, are unable to swim and it is impossible to get close without scaring them.

""But within a few weeks their fur becomes thicker and grey, and the pup is ready to explore the depths of the lake and the magical world below the ice.""

Finding a burrow in the vast expanse of the Baikal ice is no easy job, but after a few fruitless dives they struck gold — with the professional help of Pulka, a local dog, seen on slide eight, with years of experience in the job.

"A group of scientists have concluded that sharks possess an internal navigation system similar to GPS that allows them to use Earth’s magnetic forces to travel long distances with accuracy.

Researchers from Florida State University made the discovery by subjecting 20 bonnethead sharks, part of the hammerhead family, to “magnetic displacement” exercises that replicated geographical locations hundreds of miles from where they were captured.

When the sharks were exposed to magnetic cues emulating a site about 375 miles south of where they were captured, they turned to swim north, exhibiting a “homeward orientation” suggesting the use of magnetic forces in their navigation, said Bryan Keller, the lead author of the study.

The research helps explain why sharks can travel across vast oceans but return to exactly the same location annually to feed, breed and give birth, Keller said. He and his team believe the bonnetheads’ “onboard” navigation system is probably common to other species of sharks because it is unlikely bonnetheads evolved with sensitivity to magnetic forces while others that also travel long distances did not.

According to Science Magazine, in 2005 a great white shark was tracked swimming from South Africa to Australia and back again in almost a straight line, leading scientists to believe sharks have a magnetic sense to steer themselves similar to those found in sea birds, lobsters and turtles.

Until now, however, little research has been conducted.

"For a new mini-series as part of the UN climate summit, Cop26, we have spoken to six young Indigenous climate activists on what we can learn from their culture and values, as well as how decolonising our ideas of nature and land could save our futures.

First up from Chad, Indigenous women's leader, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, has a stark warning for world leaders: ""sit down, shut up and listen"".

Speaking in Glasgow today, she added: “I can come to this leader’s event with a simple message- we have the map, we know where we are going, we know how to drive, so pass the key.”

Despite only making up around 6% of the global population, Indigenous people protect 80% of biodiversity left in the world. So, without question, we have many important lessons to learn.

"A new book of black and white images, taken over three decades, showcases photographer Raúl Cañibano’s love for his native country, Cuba.

Born in Havana in 1961, Cañibano originally trained as a welder - and it was not until 1984 that he started to teach himself how to use a camera.

He developed his own style - which he calls ‘somehow surrealist’ - by studying the works of great painters - and is now considered one of the most gifted photographers in Latin America.

In this series of portraits, Cañibano captures familiar everyday moments in urban and rural settings, focusing on genuine people - who never appear manipulated or contrived - letting the viewer sense the heart and soul of the island.

"For our series paying tribute to cultural figures who passed away in 2021, Otis Williams, founder of the Temptations, remembers his fiercely determined Motown colleague Mary Wilson, who lit up the stage with the Supremes and fought for artists’ rights.

“Our careers went in parallel in many aspects, and that bonded us as friends,” he says. “Our bands were known together as Motown’s no-hit wonders – neither of us had a hit until late 1963, which was hard.

But Mary had a lot of determination. She’d throw everything into her performances. We’d sing in nightclubs together and I’d watch her from the side of the stage, notice how hard she was working.”

When Diana Ross left the band, Wilson fought to keep copyright of the Supremes’ name and went on to help draft the historic Truth In Music bill, protecting the trademark of a band name for original members.

Wilson kept working on music until her death; Williams spoke to her just a few weeks before he heard she had gone. “She said to me: “I’m still your Mary’...

"Twenty livestock companies are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than either Germany, Britain or France – and are receiving billions of dollars in financial backing to do so, according to a new report by environmental campaigners.

Between 2015 and 2020, global meat and dairy companies received more than US$478bn in backing from 2,500 investment firms, banks, and pension funds, most of them based in North America or Europe, according to the Meat Atlas, which was compiled by Friends of the Earth and the European political foundation, Heinrich Böll Stiftung.

Although the vast majority of growth was likely to take place in the global south, the biggest producers will continue to be China, Brazil, the USA and the members of the European Union. By 2029 these countries may still produce 60% of worldwide meat output.

Across the world, the report says, three-quarters of all agricultural land is used to raise animals or the crops to feed them. “In Brazil alone, 175m hectares is dedicated to raising cattle,” an area of land that is about equal to the “entire agricultural area of the European Union”.

Raising livestock contributes significantly to carbon emissions, with animal agriculture accounting for 14.5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Scientific reports have found that rich countries need huge reductions in meat and dairy consumption to tackle the climate emergency.

The new report has now called for more meat industry regulation and for private banks and investors to stop financing large-scale, intensive animal protein production projects.

"The woolly mammoth could be resurrected. 

Ten thousand years after the incredible giants vanished from the face of the Earth, scientists are embarking on an ambitious project to bring the beasts back to the Arctic tundra.

The prospect of recreating mammoths and returning them to the wild has been discussed, seriously at times, for more than a decade, but researchers have announced fresh funding they believe could make their dream a reality.

The boost comes in the form of $20.4m raised by the bioscience and genetics company @itiscolossal, co-founded by Ben Lamm, a tech and software entrepreneur, and George Church, a professor of genetics at @harvardmed who has pioneered new approaches to gene editing.

"Marvel’s latest big-budget adventure Eternals has been pulled from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait after Disney reportedly refused to cut a same-sex kiss; the first onscreen LGBTQ kiss in the franchise.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the $200m movie will not be released in some countries in the Gulf region after being removed from local sites.

The studio has yet to comment or confirm but sources claim that the reason is because of a kiss between Brian Tyree Henry’s character, Atlanta, and his on-screen husband, Little America, played by Haaz Sleiman.

Homosexuality is still illegal across much of the region and is punishable by death in both Saudi Arabia and Qatar. A local cinema chain confirmed to the trade that the film was “banned” but had no explanation provided.

In Singapore, Eternals has become the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to gain an M18 certificate, which restricts audiences to those aged 18 and older. A spokesperson for the country’s Infocomm Media Development Authority confirmed that it was a result of “homosexual references”. The film also contains a sex scene between two heterosexual characters.

Director Chloe Zhao, who won the Oscar for best director earlier this year for Nomadland, spoke recently about her desire to not tweak any scenes to appease censors.

Lebanese actor Sleiman, who came out as gay in 2017, spoke about the importance of the scene at the film’s premiere. “It’s life-saving,” he said to Variety. “Can you imagine how many lives this is going to be saving – kids, young queer folk, who are being bullied, committing suicide, and not seeing themselves being represented? And now they get to see this – it’s above and beyond.”

"A 3.5m-tall puppet child refugee has nearly completed her 8,000km journey across Europe to highlight the hostility experienced by refugees who have been travelling the same route from the Syrian border to the UK for years.

The unaccompanied nine-year-old Syrian girl searching for her mother - the character of Amal (which means hope in Arabic) - was developed from a play created by the refugee theatre company Good Chance.

The goal of her epic trek was to make thousands of people along the route to reflect on their attitudes towards refugees, particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced children forced to flee their homes because of conflict over the past decade.

Little Amal started 'The Walk' in the Turkish city of Gaziantep in July and will end in Manchester, England in early November. Today, she was greeted by a group of schoolchildren, alongside British actor Jude Law, on Folkestone Pier after crossing the Channel.

Things haven't always gone smoothly along the way. In Greece, far-right protesters threw things at her as she walked through the streets and local councillors voted to ban her from visiting a village of Orthodox monasteries. In France, the mayor of Calais raised objections to her presence.

But there have been bright spots on her journey too. As she started the walk in Gaziantep, at the Turkish border with Syria, refugee children made lanterns to welcome her. In Italy, the puppet went to the Vatican and shook hands with the Pope, while thousands of children in Brussels wrote letters to her, in an effort to make them to think about the experience of being a child refugee.

As she crossed the Channel to the UK on Tuesday for the final stage of her journey, producer David Lan said; “If I was to say to you we had nothing but warmth and support along the 8,000km journey, it would not be true.""

“But what Little Amal seems to do is take the experience of people who are quite brutally marginalised and put it in the centre. This is about goodwill. It is an opportunity for people to be sympathetic and imagine what it would be like to be her.”

"Exclusive: Vladimir Putin personally authorised a secret spy agency operation to support a “mentally unstable” Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election during a closed session of Russia’s national security council, according to what are assessed to be leaked Kremlin documents.

According to the papers obtained by the Guardian, the key meeting took place on 22 January 2016 with the Russian president, his spy chiefs and senior ministers all present.

They agreed a Trump White House would help secure Moscow’s strategic objectives, among them “social turmoil” in the US and a weakening of the American president’s negotiating position.

Russia’s three spy agencies were ordered to find practical ways to support Trump, in a decree appearing to bear Putin’s signature.

By this point Trump was the frontrunner in the Republican party’s nomination race. A report prepared by Putin’s expert department recommended Moscow use “all possible force” to ensure a Trump victory.

"The 'pink' supermoon isn't actually supposed to be pink.

Australian astrophysicist Prof Jonti Horner says that the pink moon is not named because it takes on a particular colour, but is named after a the colour of a North American native herb known as the creeping phlox.

Horner says in the United States, there’s a tendency towards using the names that Native Americans have for full moons.

The moon “definitely won’t be pink”, he said yesterday, but if you’re somewhere where there is pollution in the air, then it could take on a more reddish tinge.

The term supermoon? Well, it was coined by an American astrologer Richard Nolle in 1979. Technically, we get a supermoon when a full moon occurs around the time our satellite reaches perigee - its closest point to the Earth.

"What do you reckon? Will you be buying a pair?

""An entirely new way for people to stay connected to the world around them and truly be present in life’s most important moments,"" is how the 'smart glasses' are being pitched by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth.

You can take calls, listen to podcasts, and take images or video, but there is no augmented reality layered on top of the real world. Building true augmented reality is the ultimate goal of Facebook's Reality Labs division.

The frames are just a few millimetres thicker than a standard pair of Wayfarers, and each wing of the glasses hides a camera, which combine to shoot still images and video of up to 30 seconds with a long or short tap of the device’s only button.

The glasses don’t actually come from Facebook at all. Instead, the company is working with Ray-Ban, on whose classic Wayfarer designs the hardware has been modelled, and the device will be branded as a Ray-Ban product first and foremost.

If the whole thing sounds, and looks, familiar, it’s because the concept bears a heavy resemblance to Snapchat’s Spectacles, now in their third generation.

“We believe that this will be the first pair of smart glasses people will truly want to wear,"" says Facebook’s Monisha Perkash.

"Could controlling toilet habits of cows be the key to more environmentally friendly farming?

In Germany, one herd has been “potty-trained” in an experiment to teach calves to use a toilet area in their barn, meaning that urine could be collected and treated.

Scientists trained the cows via a system of rewards and mild punishments. When they urinated in the assigned area, they were given a sweet drink or some mashed barley, and when they relieved themselves elsewhere, they were surprised by a short blast of water from above.

Waste from cattle farms often contaminates soil and waterways and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and the acidification of soil.

For this reason, toilet-training cattle has long been viewed as desirable, but several previous attempts have been unsuccessful.

Within a few weeks, after about 15 training sessions, 11 out of the 16 calves in the experiment had been successfully toilet-trained, according to the study published in the journal Current Biology.

“Cattle, like many other animals, are quite clever and they can learn a lot,” said Jan Langbein, an animal psychologist at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) in Germany. “Why shouldn’t they be able to learn how to use a toilet?”

Langbein said a future ambition would be to teach cows to also defecate in a toilet area.

The ammonia produced in cow urine doesn’t directly contribute to the climate crisis, but when it leaches into the soil, microbes convert it into nitrous oxide, which is the third most significant greenhouse gas after methane and carbon dioxide.

"Coca-Cola bottles and cans were the most prevalent branded litter on beaches in the UK, a report has found - with campaigners calling on the government to get on with introducing a deposit return scheme for packaging.

Almost two-thirds (65%) of all branded packaging pollution across the nation's coastline can be traced back to just 12 companies, according to the findings by the marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage (SAS).

These are Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, AB InBev, McDonald’s, Mondelēz International, Heineken, Tesco, Carlsberg Group, Suntory, Haribo, Mars and Aldi.

In total 3,913 volunteers collected branded items over 11,139 miles, making it the UK’s biggest coordinated cleanup event. SAS recorded a total of 9,998 branded items that were linked to 328 companies.

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola said: “Like everyone, we care about reducing packaging waste and we don’t want to see any of our packaging end up where it shouldn’t ... It’s disappointing to see any packaging being littered and that’s why we support the introduction of a well-designed deposit return scheme, which would encourage people to recycle rather than litter or throw away.""

Many companies say that a lack of a good deposit return scheme (DRS) in the UK means the packaging of their products gets needlessly littered.

There are plans for such a scheme in Britain, but this has been delayed until 2024 – with the government blaming the Covid-19 pandemic.

In a DRS consumers are charged an additional deposit fee when they buy a drink in a single-use container. This deposit acts as an incentive to support recycling because it is redeemed when the consumer returns the empty container to a return point.

"""It’s heartwarming to have seen the empathy towards their plight from so many of you"".

Gary Lineker is to return to presenting sport on the BBC after he was taken off air for a post on Twitter criticising the language used by UK ministers when discussing the government’s asylum policy.

Tim Davie, the director general of the BBC, apologised on Monday for the widespread disruption to sports programming over the weekend, and announced an independent review of the corporation’s internal social media guidelines.

Lineker, who is a freelance broadcaster for the BBC and their highest-paid presenter – receiving £1.35m annually – welcomed the review and said he was keen to get back to his presenting duties, including Match of the Day. 

“I am glad that we have found a way forward,” he said in the joint statement with Davie. “I support this review and look forward to getting back on air.”

After the statement was released, Lineker tweeted his thanks for support of colleagues after a “surreal few days”. Pundits, led by Ian Wright, had refused to appear on Match of the Day while Lineker was suspended. Commentators also joined in, plunging BBC Sport’s coverage into chaos.

Lineker also said that “however difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn’t compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away ... We remain a country of predominantly tolerant, welcoming and generous people. Thank you.""

"“We are going to live new times of peace, love and hope.""

These are the words of Brazil's new leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, after his narrow victory over the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro.

The 77-year old, a former factory worker who became Brazil’s first working-class president exactly 20 years ago, has sealed an astonishing political comeback over Bolsonaro in one of the most significant and bruising elections in the country’s history.

With 99.97% of votes counted, Silva had secured 50.9% of the vote. Bolsonaro, a firebrand who was elected in 2018, received 49.10%.

Addressing journalists at a hotel in São Paulo, Lula vowed to reunify his country after a toxic race for power which has profoundly divided one of the world’s largest democracies.

Silva was sidelined from the 2018 election that saw Bolsonaro claim power after being jailed on corruption charges that were later annulled.

"Four months ago, 35-year-old Gabriel Boric confounded the polls to claim victory in a presidential primary he had barely been old enough to compete in. 

But on 11 March next year, he will now be sworn in as Chile’s youngest ever president – having amassed more votes than any presidential candidate in history.

Boric is the driving force behind Chile’s abrupt changing of the guard. He belongs to a radical generation of student leaders who are grimly determined to bury dictator Augusto Pinochet’s bitter legacy once and for all.

“Chile was the birthplace of neoliberalism, and it shall also be its grave!” he shouted from a stage the night of his primary win, his forearm tattoo peeking out from beneath a rolled-up sleeve.

Neoliberalism sees competition as the defining characteristic of human relations. It redefines citizens as consumers, whose democratic choices are best exercised by buying and selling, a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency. It maintains that “the market” delivers benefits that could never be achieved by planning.

Boric said his generation wanted to have its rights respected and not be treated “like consumer goods or a business”, adding the country would no longer allow Chile’s poor to “keep paying the price” of inequality.

So who exactly is Gabriel Boric - and how did he beat his ultra-conservative far-right opponent, José Antonio Kast? Tap the link in bio to read more.

Ritter, who starred as the family patriarch Martin in Channel 4’s Friday Night Dinner alongside Tamsin Greig, Simon Bird and Tom Rosenthal, died on Monday.
In a statement, his agent said that the actor, who also appeared in numerous films including Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Quantum of Solace, died at home with his family by his side.

"From county officials and sheriffs to governors and senators, white male minority rule pervades politics in the United States, according to a new report shared exclusively with @guardian_us.

White men represent 30% of the population but 62% of officeholders, dominating both chambers of Congress, 42 state legislatures and statewide roles across the nation, the analysis shows.

By contrast, women and people of colour constitute 51% and 40% of the US population respectively, but just 31% and 13% of officeholders, according to the research by the Reflective Democracy Campaign.

“I think if we saw these numbers in another country, we would say there is something very wrong with that political system,” said Brenda Choresi Carter, the campaign’s director.

“We would say, ‘how could that possibly be a democratic system with that kind of demographic mismatch?’”

Two factors perpetuate white male control over virtually every lever of US government: the huge advantage enjoyed by incumbents, and the Republican party’s continued focus on mostly white male candidates.

As the US barrels toward a minority-white population within a matter of decades, some believe elected officials will inevitably become more diverse. But that logic is flawed: women have always been half of the country, and they are still chronically underrepresented in government.

Meanwhile, politicians who currently hold office can make election laws and draw districts in their favour. This legislative cycle, Republican state lawmakers have devised a barrage of new voter restrictions that have targeted left-leaning communities, vulnerable voters and people of colour.

"This is Chantelle Mulladad - an Aboriginal artist standing in front of Australia’s famed continent-crossing train - adorned with her work.

Three carriages of the Ghan train have been transformed into a stunning moving Aboriginal artwork titled Crossroads.

Mulladad is an Arrernte woman from the remote Indigenous community of Ltyentye Apurte, where she works with the Keringke Art Centre that her mother co-founded.

“Crossroads was based on my teenage years,” she says. “I had to choose which path to go on, and I chose the right path to make something of myself and be an artist.”

The other path? “You know, wild young teenage life,” she laughs.

"“This piece is considered a God, not just a sculpture.”

For more than 20 years, those who lived in and around the village of Lokhari in Uttar Pradesh, India, have prayed for the return of an important statue of a goddess that was stolen from a local temple.

Now, the 8th-century goat-headed deity has been discovered thousands of miles away – in a garden in the UK, and will formally be given back to the High Commission of India in London.

It is a case that shames Sotheby’s, which offered the statue for sale in 1988, a few years before the auctioneer was to face serious allegations of having encouraged looting of ancient Indian religious sites.

In 1997, the statue was among looted antiquities featured in the former Observer journalist Peter Watson’s damning book, titled Sotheby’s: Inside Story. He and investigators from the Channel 4 Dispatches programme also secretly filmed Indian dealers claiming that they had supplied an entire container-load of objects, some of which were sold at Sotheby’s in London. It led to the auction house ending regular antiquities sales in London and tightening up procedures to ensure it would not handle an item if there was a suspicion it might have been looted abroad.

This recovery has been made possible by Christopher Marinello, a leading expert in recovering stolen, looted and missing art. “This piece is considered a god, not just a sculpture,” he said. “Looted objects are not simply financial assets for collectors and auction houses to profit from.”

He added: “My goal is to call out Sotheby’s for selling loot but more importantly to highlight the countless looted objects in English gardens and collections related to colonial history.""

Sotheby’s said: “This episode relates to something that allegedly occurred almost quarter of a century ago. Sotheby’s adheres to the highest standards in the industry, supported by a world-class compliance team, who work closely with outside authorities to ensure that we operate to the highest level of business integrity.”

"How the climate crisis upended my life - by Vanessa Nieuwenhuizen in Samoa: 

It was the day before we were supposed to fly to Australia for a family reunion and Christmas in 2012, so it was a very exciting day to start off with. There was a cyclone due to hit Samoa. It started to rain really heavily and by the afternoon we started seeing water rising just around the house.

At around 4.30, I heard my husband screaming outside and I knew something was very wrong. By the time I made it outside, there was a massive gush of water coming towards our house, like an inland tsunami.

My husband yelled to grab the kids. My baby was sitting on the toilet. I grabbed him by the arm. The water was rising so quickly that by the time we made it out of the house, the water was up to our hips. 

We have four children and so my husband and I had one child on each arm as we waded through the water. There was one point where my husband and I looked at each other and in my anxious mind I thought: please, please, Heavenly Father, don’t let us have to make a decision to let one of our children go.

We all made it through, thank goodness. But the thought of having to let go of one of our children, I wouldn’t wish it upon any parent.

We made it into the workshop, and climbed the stairs towards the little storeroom. Our entire house was gone, our cars had been washed away, big machines in our workshop that had been bolted to the ground had washed away – that’s how strong the water was. We stayed up in the storeroom for several hours, wrapped in old, dirty curtains to keep ourselves warm. I remember thinking: if we make it out alive, how and where are we going to start all over again?

We had an amazing life in Samoa but after we lost everything in that flash flood, we decided to move to Australia. Australia has been kind to us, but as much as we say this is home, Samoa will always be home. I miss Samoa. Every occasion, my thoughts turn to home, and I still cry.

#samoa #climatecrisis",2021-11-08 10:00:59,"How the climate crisis upended my life  by Vanessa Nieuwenhuizen in Samoa 

It was the day before we were supposed to fly to Australia for a family reunion and Christmas in 2012 so it was a very exciting day to start off with There was a cyclone due to hit Samoa It started to rain really heavily and by the afternoon we started seeing water rising just around the house

At around 430 I heard my husband screaming outside and I knew something was very wrong By the time I made it outside there was a massive gush of water coming towards our house like an inland tsunami

My husband yelled to grab the kids My baby was sitting on the toilet I grabbed him by the arm The water was rising so quickly that by the time we made it out of the house the water was up to our hips 

We have four children and so my husband and I had one child on each arm as we waded through the water There was one point where my husband and I looked at each other and in my anxious mind I thought please please Heavenly Father dont let us have to make a decision to let one of our children go

We all made it through thank goodness But the thought of having to let go of one of our children I wouldnt wish it upon any parent

We made it into the workshop and climbed the stairs towards the little storeroom Our entire house was gone our cars had been washed away big machines in our workshop that had been bolted to the ground had washed away  thats how strong the water was We stayed up in the storeroom for several hours wrapped in old dirty curtains to keep ourselves warm I remember thinking if we make it out alive how and where are we going to start all over again

We had an amazing life in Samoa but after we lost everything in that flash flood we decided to move to Australia Australia has been kind to us but as much as we say this is home Samoa will always be home I miss Samoa Every occasion my thoughts turn to home and I still cry

"This is Geronimo and right now he's probably the world's most famous alpaca. Here's why: the six-year old animal is facing a death sentence after twice testing positive for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a deadly respiratory disease that has blighted the countryside for decades.

The row over his fate has captured the public’s imagination – with a petition to save him gathering nearly 100,000 signatures, celebrity backing and his friendly, furry face splashing British newspaper front pages. But vets have cautioned that the law is clear: Geronimo the alpaca must be put down.

Owner Helen Macdonald, a veterinary nurse who runs an alpaca farm in Gloucestershire, first brought Geronimo to the UK from New Zealand four years ago, when he tested positive on arrival. Since then, she says she has spent £80,000 exhausting legal avenues trying to save him.

Despite the campaigning, the environment secretary George Eustice has wrote that culling animals for bTB was an “arduous but necessary endeavour” and that Geronimo’s positive tests, which Macdonald disputes, are a “very strong indicator of the presence of the disease”.

Vets have said being an alpaca does not give Geronimo an exemption from rules that apply to all animals.

Sarah Tomlinson, a farm vet and bTB expert who sits on Defra’s Bovine TB Partnership, said: ""Ultimately it is a notifiable disease, and we have quite specific laws around notifiable diseases because they have either impacts on animal health and welfare, impacts on international trade – so if we have it we can’t trade – and also for public health reasons.”

Notifiable diseases are usually highly contagious infections that can spread to humans, especially when animals are in regular close contact with people. Macdonald has vowed to “stand in the way of any gunman who comes to destroy Geronimo” and insists that he poses no risk to other animals or humans.

"For the first time since the beginning of England’s national lockdown nearly a year ago, care home residents have finally been allowed to have a family visitor meet them face to face.

On 8 March, when regulations were loosened, photographer @christopherbethell saw his mum sit next to his grandmother's bed to hold her hand and comfort her.

The rules permit only one visitor, so he watched through her window of Green Gables care home - and documented his experience, as well as other families reuniting.

Covid-19 has taken a brutal toll on care homes: in the UK, between mid-March and mid-June 2020 there were 19,286 deaths in which the virus was mentioned on death certificates.

But the effects are not only seen in the statistics. Care home residents have been isolated from the world – the lucky ones live on ground floors where they could have visitors to their windows, but many are secluded a floor or two up.

"Handmaid's tale or an exciting breakthrough?

In a world first - a synthetic embryo with a beating heart has been created without the need for sperm, eggs and fertilisation.

Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Israel found that stem cells from mice could be made to self-assemble into early embryo-like structures.

The researchers believe the work could also reduce animal experimentation and ultimately pave the way for new sources of cells and tissues for human transplantation. For example, skin cells from a leukaemia patient could potentially be transformed into bone marrow stem cells to treat their condition.

When compared with natural mouse embryos, the synthetic embryos were 95% the same in terms of their internal structure and the genetic profiles of the cells. As far as the scientists could tell, the organs that formed were functional. But crucially, these synthetic embryos did not have the potential to develop into live animals, or at least they hadn’t when they had been transplanted into the wombs of female mice.

Speaking to StatNews, Prof Paul Tesar, a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University, said the more scientists pushed stem cell-derived embryos further and further along the path of development, the more the synthetic and natural embryos begin to merge.

“There will always be a grey area,” he said. “But as scientists and as a society we need to come together to decide where the line is and define what is ethically acceptable.”

"What foods do you need to stay healthy at every stage of your life? And are you eating enough of them? 🍎🍐🍋🥦🥬🧅🧀🥛

""Nutrition is one of the hardest sciences to do well,” says Graham Lawton, a science writer whose first book, This Book Could Save Your Life, aimed to debunk a number of contemporary health fads.

And while it is difficult to generalise, Lawton says there is some consensus over the sorts of food we might want to prioritise at various life stages.

We spoke to him – along with nutrition experts, Dr Rachel Ward, who is a GP in Oxfordshire, and Sophie Medlin, London chair of the British Dietetic Association – to find out the ideal ingredients for healthy eating throughout our lives.

Swipe to find out what they said.

As for all ages, this is what they recommended:

❌ Unsurprisingly, avoid ultra-processed foods, which are high in sugar, salt and artificial trans fats (a type of fat so closely linked to heart disease that they’ve been banned in Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and some US states)
✔️ Load up on fruit and vegetables — and remember to eat a variety.
✔️ Omega-3 (found in foods like white fleshed and oily fish) can keep your heart healthy.
✔️ Calcium is not only good for growing children but for adults 30+ to ensure bone health.

For everything else?
“It’s about moderate doses,” says Lawton.

The challenge, which is a set of 12 riddles linked to design elements of the new £50 note featuring Turing, who helped develop the Bombe during the second world war, a machine to help crack the German Enigma code, that is regarded as a forerunner of modern computers.

GCHQ, one of the three UK intelligence agencies, believes setting puzzles gives the public an insight into its surveillance work, adding that the #TuringChallenge will likely take an experienced puzzler seven hours to complete.

"The UK, Canada, Germany and other EU states have supported a deliberate policy to withhold vaccines from the poorest countries in the world, and defended an immoral and unethical economic system which places big pharma patents ahead of millions of lives, writes former director at the World Health Organization, Anthony Costello.

""Millions more people will die from Covid-19 in the coming year, and most will be unvaccinated. The vaccines that could save millions of lives are not reaching the poor majority of the world’s population.

""The contrast is stark: the current share of people fully vaccinated in high, upper-middle income, lower-middle income and low income countries is 69%, 68%, 30% and 3.5% respectively.""

This map shows the huge inequality in the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines across the globe. It shows the number of doses administered per 100 people over time until 8 December this year.

Vaccines help stem transmission and reduce the number of host bodies available for further mutations to take place. Being a very globalised planet with people travelling from around the world all the time, only vaccinating certain countries is a roll of the dice again and again on variants, as Omicron makes clear.

It didn’t have to be this way. Around 12bn doses are forecast to be produced by the end of this year. Had a principle of vaccine equity governed the global rollout, this could have comfortably vaccinated every adult in the world.

"Workers in Turkish factories, construction sites and fields have become unlikely stars of TikTok, revealing harsh and dangerous conditions in posts that have now had millions of views.

Turkey, ranked among the '10 worst countries in the world for workers' by the ITUC's Global Rights Index, is one of TikTok’s largest user bases, with approximately 19.2 million users.

Most labourers are not members of unions, nor do they have insurance,, but TikTok's algorithm can allow a labourer with a handful of followers to reach millions if their posts land on the 'discover' page.

But despite the grim reality evident in these videos, creativity and humour shine through the cracks.

"Scientists have created synthetic human embryos using stem cells, in a groundbreaking advance that sidesteps the need for eggs or sperm.

Scientists say these model embryos, which resemble those in the earliest stages of human development, could provide a crucial window on the impact of genetic disorders and the biological causes of recurrent miscarriage.

However, the work also raises serious ethical and legal issues as the lab-grown entities fall outside current legislation in most countries.

The structures do not have a beating heart or the beginnings of a brain, but include cells that would typically go on to form the placenta, yolk sac and the embryo itself.

The development highlights how rapidly the science in this field has outpaced the law, and scientists iare already moving to draw up voluntary guidelines to govern work on synthetic embryos.

“If the whole intention is that these models are very much like normal embryos, then in a way they should be treated the same,” Robin Lovell-Badge, the head of stem cell biology and developmental genetics at the Francis Crick Institute in London said. “Currently in legislation they’re not. People are worried about this.”

Unfortunately for most of us who live in cities, stargazing is constrained by light pollution. But those in rural Australia have some of the best vantage points in the world to look beyond our world.

Rodney Watters and Niall MacNeill have taken advantage of that, venturing deep into the bush outside Bathurst, New South Wales, to shoot these incredible photographs using an alchemy of high-speed cameras, telescopes and computer processors.

"England captain, Harry Kane, joined Germany's captain Manuel Neuer in wearing rainbow-coloured armbands for their match at Wembley last night to mark the end of Pride month and to show support for LGBTQ+ communities around the world.

It was the first time Kane has donned this armband - while Neuer has worn it for all his Euro 2020 matches in June. ""From our point of view it is a show of solidarity with the German national team from all of us at the England national team to be united in trying to kick out all inequalities there are,"" Kane said.

Earlier this month, Uefa investigated whether it could be viewed as a political statement before concluding there would be no disciplinary proceedings, given the armband was a “symbol of diversity"" and thus the German goalkeeper was “promoting a good cause”.

But last week, the governing body was criticised after ruling Munich’s Allianz Arena could not be lit up in rainbow colours to support LGBTQ+ rights for the evening’s match between Germany and Hungary because it contravened the governing body’s rules regarding political and religious neutrality. The city's mayor said he wanted to protest against a new law in Hungary that forbids gay people from featuring in educational materials in schools or TV shows for those under 18.

UEFA said the ""request itself was political"" and added the rainbow colours in its own logo, saying: ""It is a symbol that embodies our core values, promoting everything that we believe in – a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone, regardless of their background, belief, gender or sexual orientation.""

"'An amazing decision'

The Australian environment minister has a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis, that's according to the country's federal court.

The judgment has been hailed by lawyers and teenagers, who brought the case, as a world first.

Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun had sought an injunction to prevent the environment minister, Sussan Ley, approving a proposal to expand a coal mine in New South Wales, arguing she ​had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change.

The judge, Justice Mordecai Bromberg, found the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people. But he did not grant the injunction as he was not satisfied the minister would breach her duty of care.

David Barnden, a lawyer representing the children, said it was a historic and “amazing decision” with potentially significant consequences.

“The court has found that the minister owes a duty of care to younger children, to vulnerable people, and that duty says that the minister must not act in a way that causes harm – future harm – from climate change to younger people,” he said outside court. “It is the first time in the world that such a duty of care has been recognised, especially in a common law country.”

"Black LGBTQ Britons have been raiding their old photograph collections to look back at time when no one had a camera phone.

Their aim was to document the lives of Black queer people in Britain who contributed to the building of Black culture and frequented Black spaces.

Okyndaye and Thompson both wanted to prioritise the history that has been buried; the old clothes, creased photographs, leaflets and posters hidden in people’s homes: ""This gives the archive the feel of a family photo album, with images that evoke memories, connect old lovers and educate younger Black queers about the spaces that have existed in the past.""

They say the collection of images, based on public submissions, is growing every week. Swipe right to see a collection of them.

"“Hope is our biggest currency right now”

The 2023 presidential election in Nigeria saw a marked rise in engagement by young people, many of whom rallied around the outsider candidate Peter Obi, who stood for the Labour party.

The vote was largely peaceful but the turnout was low - just 27%, a figure blamed in part on millions of Nigerians being unable to cast a ballot. The slow tallying of results angered voters and opposition parties, who allege vote-rigging.

Bola Tinubu, of the ruling All Progressives Congress, was declared the winner. The former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, 76, of the opposition People’s Democratic party, came second, and Obi third. The ruling party denied manipulating results.

Last week, the electoral commission said it was pushing back polling to elect state governors due to problems with the digital voting system experienced in the presidential vote on 25 February.

Obi is now contesting the result in the country’s highest court of appeal. The Labour party candidate, who for many, especially young voters, represented hope for change, said the election “will go down as one of the most controversial elections ever conducted in Nigeria”.

We spoke to five young Nigerians about how they felt about last month’s election, the results and their hopes for the future.

"Prince William has slammed BBC failures over the 1995 Martin Bashir Panorama interview with his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Following an inquiry into the 1995 broadcast, the Duke of Cambridge said the programme had established a ""false narrative"" and that the ""deceitful way"" the interview was obtained had substantially influenced what his mother had said.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, also released a statement commenting on the outcome of the investigation saying: “Our mother was an incredible woman who dedicated her life to service. She was resilient, brave, and unquestionably honest. The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her life.”

The investigation, conducted by the former supreme court judge John Dyson, ​found that Bashir had engaged in ""deceitful behaviour"" by commissioning fake bank statements to land the interview.

The BBC’s current director general, Tim Davie, said the corporation accepted the report “in full”.

Adding that: “Although the report states that Diana, Princess of Wales, was keen on the idea of an interview with the BBC, it is clear that the process for securing the interview fell far short of what audiences have a right to expect.""",2021-05-21 14:51:39,"Prince William has slammed BBC failures over the 1995 Martin Bashir Panorama interview with his mother Diana Princess of Wales

"“This get-rich-quick scheme to fast-track cronies, politically connected pals and colleagues was never going to end well. I suspect that today’s revelations, however shocking, are simply the tip of a very large iceberg – an iceberg that could yet sink this ship of fools.”

This is how the Scottish National Party's Brendan O'Hara referred to the Guardian's recent revelations that Tory peer Michelle Mone secretly received £29m from a 'VIP lane' PPE firm.

Lady Mone’s support helped newly formed company PPE Medpro secure a place in a “VIP lane” the government used during the coronavirus pandemic to prioritise companies that had political connections. The company went on to win two multi-million pound contracts supplying PPE to the NHS during Covid's first deadly wave.

Now, documents seen by the Guardian indicate that Mone and her children secretly received £29m of PPE Medpro’s profits, which were passed on from her husband through a series of offshore accounts, trusts and companies.

Contacted about the new disclosures, a lawyer for Mone said: “There are a number of reasons why our client cannot comment on these issues and she is under no duty to do so.” A lawyer who represents both her husband Douglas Barrowman and PPE Medpro said that an ongoing investigation limited what they were able to say on these matters. He added: “For the time being we are also instructed to say that there is much inaccuracy in the portrayal of the alleged ‘facts’ and a number of them are completely wrong.”

"A 'dark day for LGBTI rights and for Hungary'.

Hungary’s parliament has passed a law banning gay people from featuring in school educational materials or TV shows for under-18s, as the country’s ruling party intensified its campaign against gay rights.

The Hungarian legislation outlaws sharing information with under-18s that the government considers to be promoting homosexuality or gender change.

Companies and large organisations will also be banned from running adverts in solidarity with gay people, if they are deemed to target under-18s.

The law means that TV shows and films featuring gay characters, or even a rainbow flag, would be permitted only after the watershed

The national assembly passed the legislation by 157 votes to one, despite a boycott of the vote by some opposition politicians.

The outcome was never in doubt, as the ruling Fidesz party, led by prime minister Viktor Orbán, has a healthy majority and were supported by the far-right Jobbik party

The measures have been likened by critics to Russia’s 2013 law against “gay propaganda” that independent monitors say has increased social hostility and fuelled vigilante attacks against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the EU country’s eastern neighbour

Amnesty International’s Hungarian chapter, which has spearheaded protests against the plans, described the passing of the law as a “dark day for LGBTI rights and for Hungary”.",2021-06-15 18:55:55,"A dark day for LGBTI rights and for Hungary

"These are spiderwebs blowing in the breeze 🕷️

They've been spun together by millions of spiders each throwing up a single thread to escape flood water in eastern Victoria, Australia. These threads then connect to each other, creating the illusion of  billowing silk sheets – known as the gossamer effect.

The threads are so thin and delicate that a breeze can break the web, dispersing spiders across the tops of vegetation. Luckily for us the spiders aren't dangerous to humans, only causing mild irritation with their bites.

"When so many of us think of “classic literature” - plenty of white authors probably spring to mind: Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen, Hardy, Fitzgerald. Harper Lee, who wrote about race, is a favourite of many – but Black authors themselves are vastly under-represented.

Students in the UK might get the chance to study Toni Morrison or James Baldwin, but what about the rest of Black literature’s vast history?

Reports last year revealed that it was possible for pupils to complete their GCSEs and leave school without having studied a single novel or play by a non-white author. Now, leading contemporary writers are trying to do something to address this problem.

From the memoirs of a slave to the story of Britain’s first Black headteacher, leading writers including Malorie Blackman and David Olusoga choose the Black authors who inspired them.

"From @guardian_sport: Easter Monday is set to be a big day for football referee Rebecca Welch, as she becomes the first woman to officiate an EFL game from the start.

Welch has been asked to take charge of the League Two match between Harrogate and Port Vale on Easter Monday.

The 37-year-old, from Washington in County Durham, refereed the Women’s FA Cup final in 2017 and 2020.

Amy Fearn was the first woman to referee an EFL game when she came on as an injury replacement in the 2010 Championship game between Coventry and Nottingham Forest. But Welch is the first to be given a game from the off.

Welch said her dad, who came to every game she officiated pre-Covid is over the moon.

She also emphasised how important it is for female referees to get recognition; “It shows that there is a real opportunity to young girls who are wondering if they are ready to take the whistle or are already referees, because they can aspire to be an EFL referee or operate in the Premier League.”",2021-03-30 19:23:31,"From guardiansport Easter Monday is set to be a big day for football referee Rebecca Welch as she becomes the first woman to officiate an EFL game from the start

"France have knocked England out of the World Cup after goals by Oliver Giroud and Aurélien Tchouaméni gave the reigning champions a 2-1 victory at the Al Bayt stadium. 

Harry Kane equalised from the spot but then blazed a second late penalty over the bar to help see the Three Lions fall to a seventh defeat in 10 World Cup quarter-finals. 

France are now one win away from becoming the first back-to-back finalists since Brazil in 2002 and two from becoming the third team ever to retain the trophy after Brazil in 1962 and Italy in 1938.

In 2018, all four semi-finalists of the World Cup were European; this time round, South America are represented by Argentina - who will play Croatia on Tuesday, and for the first time, Africa are represented by Morocco, who will play France on Wednesday.

"“So how do Afghan women dress then? This is how.""

Those are the words of BBC journalist Sana Safi - one of hundreds of Afghan women around the world who have joined an online campaign sharing photos of themselves wearing traditional colourful clothes, using the hashtag #DoNotTouchMyClothes.

The protest is a response to a sit-down demonstration orchestrated by the Taliban at Kabul University, where about 300 women appeared in all-black garments covering their faces, hands and feet – the sort of dress previously never seen across the country.

Waving Taliban flags, the women said they supported the militants who have announced that women would not be allowed to hold high-ranking government positions and that schools and universities needed to be gender-segregated.

Since the Taliban took the capital Kabul, it has set up an all-male interim government. Many Afghan women, especially in urban centres, fear that their hard-gained freedoms might be limited, remembering the 1996 to 2001 Taliban regime that saw women largely confined to their homes.

Dr Bahar Jalali, an Afghan historian and gender studies expert, posted the first photo using the #DoNotTouchMyClothes hashtag, which has since inspired Afghan women across the globe.

Peymana Assad, the first person of Afghan origin to be elected to public office in the UK, posted a photo of herself in colourful garments (as seen on the fourth slide) and tweeted: “This is Afghan culture. My traditional dress.”

Despite the Taliban’s announcement that further protests would only be allowed if approved by the ministry of justice, women in Kabul have pledged to continue their demonstrations.

"How do you feel about car-free Sundays and working from home?

Both could help our current international oil crisis, according to the global energy watchdog.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has suggested a 10-point plan to help reduce global oil demand.

The IEA’s plan could help cut oil usage by 2.7m barrels per day (bpd) of oil within four months.

Currently, the world uses about 100m bpd of oil, which isn’t sustainable.

Drastically bringing down the world’s oil consumption would help ease sky-high oil prices that are hurting consumers, reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled resources and be better for the planet.

Once a dressage competitor, the 15-year-old horse now spends his time doing rounds at the hospital's palliative care centre often staying with sick people until the end.

Peyo and his trainer, Hassen Bouchakour, work with Les Sabots du Coeur, an organisation devoted to therapy, and with scientists who are studying Peyo’s ability to reduce patients’ anxiety and comfort people in pain.

Bouchakour says; ""With Peyo, we try to recreate life at the end of life, in order to fight, and create an energy to accompany families and caregiver"". The horse tells his trainer which room he wants to enter next by stopping or raising his leg.

"“It was absolutely thrilling,” says Lesley Stevenson, senior paintings conservator at the National Galleries of Scotland, about the moment she discovered this previously unknown self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh.

The artist’s already famous painting Head of a Peasant Woman was being X-rayed as part of a cataloguing exercise and in preparation for the Royal Scottish Academy’s summer exhibition of French impressionism.

The X-ray plates were processed in an old-fashioned darkroom, and when Stevenson looked at the images she realised she was staring at the face of Van Gogh himself.

“Lo and behold! We don’t see much of the peasant woman, but what we have is the lead white, the much heavier pigment he used for his face, showing up after the X-ray goes through the cardboard.”

Now the conservators will try to separate the self-portrait from the original painting without damaging either work.

“It’s like stepping into the unknown,” Stevenson said. “The challenge will be removing the adhesive from the oil paint layers, exploiting the difference in solubility of animal-based glue and oil-based paint.”

"Darius - a giant rabbit proclaimed the biggest in the world - has been stolen from his home in England.

Police in Worcestershire believe the 129cm-long continental giant rabbit was taken from its enclosure in the garden of the property in Stoulton overnight on Saturday.

Darius, who is roughly two-thirds as long as a king size bed, was awarded a Guinness World Record in 2010 for being the biggest of its kind.

His owner, Annette Edwards, has offered a £1,000 reward for his return, begging someone to “please bring him back”, adding that he was too old to breed now.

The force have asked for those with information about the incident to contact PC Daren Riley via 101 quoting reference 00286-I-11042021.",2021-04-13 15:00:57,"Darius  a giant rabbit proclaimed the biggest in the world  has been stolen from his home in England

The agitation was triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman, on 16 September after she was arrested by the morality police in Tehran.

From the outset the movement had a feminist character, but it has also united citizens of different classes and ethnicities around a shared desire to see the back of the Islamic Republic ...

This movement without a name, without a leader, is diverse and adaptable.

It has harnessed a vast and hitherto underexploited resource – the latent dissatisfaction of women at their second-class status – and turned it into a mighty asset.

"Why exactly did these polar bears move into an abandoned weather station? 🐻‍❄️

Last year, photographer Dmitry Kokh captured these extraordinary set of images while on a trip to a Russia's Wrangel Island - a Unesco-recognised nature reserve that’s often called a polar bear maternity ward. It is one of only a few places on the planet where the animals can be found in large numbers.

""The island is very inaccessible, which may be bad for tourists but is great for the animals,"" says Kokh, who added that: “I had dreamed about photographing polar bears for a long time.""

On the way to visit and learn more, Kokh and his group received a warning about bad weather and took shelter in Kolyuchin, which is known for the polar weather station that operated on it in Soviet times. Though the station was closed in 1992, the abandoned village still stands.

“Suddenly we noticed movement in the windows of the houses,” said Kokh. “Someone took out some binoculars and we saw the heads of polar bears. Fog, a place long deserted by people, polar bears – it was the perfect setting.”

“The bears walked around the houses and among barrels left on the island a long time ago. There were about 20 animals insight at the same time, mostly males. The females kept to the side with their cubs, closer to the shores of the island.”

Kokh asked one of Russia’s top polar bear experts, Anatoly Kochnev, what causes the animals’ behaviour – why do they love to sit in the buildings?

“First of all, polar bears are very curious by nature, so they always attempt to get through any unlocked window or door. And secondly, unfortunately, these animals were traditionally hunted, and so they use these houses as a form of protection from humans,” said Kochnev.

“I still sometimes see polar bears in decaying windows before my eyes when falling asleep,” Kokh shared.

""These bears will continue to hunt, swim among ice floes and explore islands even when civilisation ceases to exist. But life will remain eternal only if we humans finally begin to take care of the planet and the living creatures that need our protection.""

"The way traffic is directed in one of Rome's busiest hubs has been given a welcome change, with the introduction of the first female traffic controller in the role.

Cristina Corbucci made her debut on the Piazza Venezia podium this week, after the new commander of Rome's local police decided to break with the all-male tradition.

The platform was first introduced in the late 1920s as a way to make the traffic controllers more visible while directing traffic on what is ordinarily a chaotic square.

Nowadays, the podium rises up and down from the cobblestones at the flick of a switch. But whoever is on duty still has to direct the vehicles coming from three directions around them.

"Happy World Elephant Day! 🐘

Is there anything more joyous than baby elephants?

These photos are from Kenya's first Indigenously owned and run sanctuary for orphaned elephants.

Established in 2016, the Reteti sanctuary rescues and rehabilitates young orphan elephants, who arrived as a result of human-elephant conflict, drought-related issues and, in one rare case, poaching.

They are nursed back to health, then sent back to the wild.

It is the beginning of a transformation in the way the Samburu people relate to wild animals.

This oasis isn’t just about saving elephants but about breaking down stereotypes and redefining wildlife management.

The sanctuary is empowering Samburu women such as Sasha L Dorothy, to be the first female elephant keepers in Africa. “Before, I was afraid of wild animals, especially elephants, but now I see them differently,” she says.

Since September 2016, the team at Reteti has rescued more than 35 elephants and returned 10 to the wild.

"""I know what it is like to shoot without an intimacy director. The messy, embarrassing feeling for the crew. The internal devastation for the actor."" 

Michaela Coel and her hit drama I May Destroy You won big at the 2021 television Baftas last night, with Coel dedicating her best actress award to the series’ intimacy coordinator, Ita O’Brien.

Accepting awards for a show that dealt with sexual abuse and consent, Coel said film and television sets were vulnerable places for actors and crew members. Not to have intimacy experts was “thoughtless” and showed a “lack of mindfulness”, she added.

I May Destroy You was one of the cultural events of 2020, in any genre. The series was inspired by Coel’s own experience of sexual assault by strangers after her drink was spiked. It is about the aftermath of a rape and is often called a “a sexual consent drama” but it is also a story of fun, friendship and more.

In 2019, our video team spent time with Ita exploring the issue of 'staged sex', particularly in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein allegations and the broader #MeToo movement.

"“What we are witnessing is a terrorist attack,” the news anchor Erick Bang announced on the GloboNews television.

Thousands of supporters of Brazil’s far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro invaded the country’s congress, presidential palace and supreme court on Sunday, in a grim echo of the US Capitol invasion two years ago by backers of former president Donald Trump.

Shocking video footage showed pro-Bolsonaro militants sprinting up the ramp into the Palácio do Planalto, the presidential offices, roaming the building’s corridors and vandalising the nearby supreme court, whose windows had been smashed.

Videos posted on social media showed fires burning inside the congress building. Furniture was broken and tossed around, objects were reportedly stolen in the presidential palace and the supreme court, and in some places sprinklers appeared to be dousing chambers.

“They are throwing chairs out of the windows,” said another bewildered GloboNews commentator, Eliane Cantanhêde. “They are destroying public buildings.”

Lula, a veteran leftist, was sworn in as Brazil’s new president last Sunday in celebrations attended by hundreds of thousands of Brazilians.

But thousands of pro-Bolsonaro extremists have refused to accept Lula’s narrow victory in October’s election, spending recent weeks camping outside army bases across the country and calling for a military coup.

Although unbelievably popular and successful while in office, Lula was imprisoned on corruption charges in 2017. These charges were later annulled by the Supreme Court, and he was free to run for president again in the 2022 election.

"When Owen Hurcum, a part-time archaeology master’s student at Bangor University, climbed to the stage to accept their position as the newly appointed mayor of Bangor, they felt “hugely humbled” to represent their community.

“It wasn’t as much a shock or surprise to become mayor of Bangor,” explains Hurcum, “but it was when they asked me to put my name forward for deputy mayor back in 2019. I wasn’t expecting that. I was very honoured that they asked me to put my candidacy forward. They didn’t put anyone up against me, so I got appointed unopposed.”

"The world’s population reached 8 billion people this week – more than three times larger than it was in 1950.

""By a remarkable coincidence, just as governments, campaigners and business owners are meeting in Egypt to address climate breakdown, the world is officially crashing past the symbolic 8 billion population milestone,"" writes our former environment editor John Vidal.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s consensus of climate scientists, identified global population growth as one of the two biggest drivers of growing CO2 emissions, warning that if population continues to grow, “it will be much harder to limit warming to 1.5C”.

"Will this go down as the greatest World Cup final of all-time? 

It was billed as the battle between Argentina's Lionel Messi and France's Kylian Mbappé, and so it proved to be in Lusail.

Messi scored two, Mbappé three – two of them late equalisers as France twice clawed their way back into the game.

But in an incredible night of drama, high emotion and fluctuating fortunes, Argentina lifted the biggest prize in world football for a third time after beating France 4-2 on penalties.

While Mbappé mesmerised – scoring the first hat-trick in a World Cup final since 1966 –and Argentina goalkeeper Emi Martínez was magnificent – it was Messi’s magic that will go down in history.

"Ever thought about eating an insect?

While mealworms have until now mostly been used as snacks for pets or as bait while fishing, scientists say they have potential as a sustainable and high-protein food source for humans.

A new study found that the flavour of insects can be altered depending on the different ways you cook them.

There's even a method for giving insects a meaty taste!

Scientists hope the recognisable flavours of meat will encourage people to start eating more insects instead of highly polluting traditional meat diets.

"Dismissed by some as 'a camera on wheels', Amazon's newest 'smart' home device has been announced.

Their home robot, named Astro, has a tablet display that show a couple of circle eyes, many sensors, and a camera.

Amazon said the robot can be remote-controlled when not at home to check on pets, or the stove. It can also automatically patrol the house and send owners a message if it detects anything out of the ordinary.

According to Vice, the robot tracks everything you do, relying heavily on facial recognition and monitoring user behaviour. However a source who worked on the robot told them that it is also heavily flawed.

""Astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity,"" they said.

To help soothe obvious privacy concerns around Astro, Amazon highlighted how owners can set up out-of-bounds areas and turn off cameras and mics, while LED lights and the screen show when someone is viewing the robot’s cameras, and it processes images and sensor data on the device.

The new robot will set you back $999 (£740).

The robot will ship later this year, Amazon said - but only in the US. And after the initial, limited run, the price will increase to $1,449.99.

So what do you think? Would you be open to getting on in your home?

"They started as flood victims, now they are touted as local heroes for cleaning up the rivers and beaches of Indonesia’s third largest city Bandung in West Java, amassing over 9 million followers on TikTok and Instagram in the process and influencing others across the country to join the fight against pollution.

The Pandawara group was formed in 2022 by five men in their early twenties after flooding caused by rivers clogged with rubbish damaged their homes. They take their name from the five Pandava princes of Indian folklore and the word wara, which translates to the five bearers of good news.

On TikTok, their profile – @pandawaragroup – contains over 100 short videos of their river and beach clean ups, earning them millions of views and totalling over 100 million likes.

“We have a team of river hunters who identifies rivers with urgent trash issues, where flooding can happen after rainfall,” Pandawara member Gilang Rahma told the Guardian.

The Greater Bandung area where they live produces 2,000 tons of waste each day, 10 to 20% of which doesn’t make it to landfill and often ends up in rivers.

Pandawara’s latest call saw 600 people, including local government staff and officials, join the clean up of 17 tons of waste from the Bugel dam in Bandung regency, which is connected to West Java’s longest river.

"The renowned health fanatic made it clear what he thought of the carbonated soft drink during a press conference in Budapest on Monday before his country’s game against Hungary.

Cristiano Ronaldo’s removal of two Coca-Cola bottles during the press conference at the Euros has coincided with a $4bn fall in the share price of the drinks giant.

Ronaldo followed it by holding up bottle of water before declaring in Portuguese: “Agua!”, appearing to encourage people to choose that instead.

While it's not expected to do any lasting damage, Coca-Cola’s share price dropped by 1.6%, from $56.10 to $55.22, almost immediately after Ronaldo’s gesture. The market value of Coca-Cola went from $242bn to $238bn – a drop of $4bn.

Coca-Cola is one of the official sponsors of Euro 2020. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Euros said 'everyone is entitled to their drink preferences' based on different 'tastes and needs'.

"The prime ministers of Finland and New Zealand have taken a swipe at suggestions their first face-to-face meeting in New Zealand happened because they are both young female leaders.

A journalist has asked Jacinda Ardern if she only met with Finnish leader Sanna Marin due to their similar age and other 'common stuff'.

Marin is in New Zealand for her first official tour, marking the first visit to the country by a Finnish prime minister. After a bilateral meeting on Wednesday morning, the two leaders affirmed the warm relationship between New Zealand and Finland and their commitment to boosting trade opportunities, tackling climate change and deepening ties.

"This is what a super blood moon looks like.

What actually is that? Well, it's what you get if you combine a total lunar eclipse and a supermoon.

It was visible across most of Australia, southeast Asia and the Americas on Wednesday.

A total lunar eclipse, also known as a blood moon, happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon and the moon is fully in the Earth’s shadow.

A supermoon, such as last month’s “pink moon”, a more common phenomenon, takes place when the full moon occurs near the closest point in its orbit to Earth.

And on Wednesday we had both at the same time!

"Rich countries with 14% of the world’s population have secured 53% of the best vaccines - while research suggests, nine out of 10 people in poor countries may never be vaccinated at all. 

South Africa, Africa’s worst-hit country, is buying Oxford’s AstraZeneca vaccine at nearly two and a half times the per-unit price of European countries.

Canada has purchased more doses per head than anyone else – enough to vaccinate every single citizen five times over. Meanwhile, the entire continent of Africa – home to 1.3 billion people – has been allocated a total of 300m doses.

"Though the Tuatara is slow-moving, the ancient reptiles have surprised researchers ... why you ask? With their fast-moving sperm.

The discovery came amid a new effort by scientists to gather and preserve the sperm of the protected at-risk species, to try to ensure it survives new threats and a warming planet.

Tuatara, unique to New Zealand, sometimes take 16 months to hatch, and 35 years to reach full size of about 0.5m.

They can then live and reproduce until they are more than 100 years old – in 2008, Henry the Tuatara became a first-time father at the age of 111.

But researchers said they were shocked to discover that tuatara sperm are the fastest swimmers of any reptile studied to date.

They think the speed could be because, unlike most other reptiles, Tuatara don't have penises, so their sperm swim four times faster than other reptiles to aid delivery. They reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his cloaca, or genital orifice, over hers.

Today, their existence is being threatened further by global heating. That's because their sex is determined by the temperature Tuatara eggs are exposed to – warmer temperatures mean more males hatch.

As the planet warms, scientists warn that more and more male hatchlings will be produced, skewing sex ratios. If populations are too male-dominated, they will become functionally extinct.

Now, New Zealand researchers are engaged in a new effort to create an “insurance policy” of frozen sperm, that they could use to replenish populations.

"The man of 'steal'?

As Chilean president Gabriel Boric gave a speech imploring people to vote in support of major progressive changes to the country's constitution, a young boy dressed as superman stole the show.

The boy, who is reportedly in the foster care of Boric's mother, appears to have no idea about the significance of the speech going on. 

The viral clip was recorded last week before Chileans voted against the new constitution which had been drafted to replace the 1980 document written under Gen Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship.

It enshrined gender parity across government and other organs of the state – for the first time anywhere in the world – prioritised environmental protection and recognised Chile’s Indigenous peoples for the first time in the country’s history.

Many criticised the document’s guarantees for Indigenous people, which they said would divide Chile. Others warned that the shakeup of the political system was unnecessary and experimental.

Chilean-American novelist Ariel Dorfman writes: ""It was the most ecologically advanced such founding document in world history, granting personhood to nature, protecting rivers and air and forests. 

""It extended democracy, established gender parity and popular participation, granted Indigenous peoples the recognition they had been denied for centuries, lovingly answered the need for universal health care, decent education and pension funds, access to water, sovereignty over mineral resources, the care for animals and children – things that generations of Chileans have been fighting for.""

"“It is designed for people who have difficulty in finding a comfortable space to work in their home and don’t want to get in the way of their family,” the creators of this minimalist office said.

Japanese design is renowned for its minimalism, and for keeping things simple and uncluttered.

So it’s no surprise that a leading housebuilder is trying to tackle the lack of space for pandemic-era working from home by marketing a tiny home-office building that can be constructed adjacent to houses in just two days, weather permitting.

The so-called Hanare Zen is a 91cm-wide and 1.8 metre-long building equipped with power sockets, a counter-type desk and very little else.

KI Star Real Estate, a popular housebuilder, began taking orders for the Hanare Zen on 6 September, hoping to find a market among those struggling to work in cramped homes.

Hanare means separate or detached in Japanese, while Zenzen is written in both the Chinese character for Zen Buddhism and the alphabet.

“We had already created the Hanare building as a kind of storage space, and with the situation in the pandemic, the idea came about to develop the Hanare Zen as a work space,” said Chisa Uchiyama, a spokesperson for KI Star Real Estate. “The use of ‘Zen’ in the name represents the minimalist concept of stripping down the size and features to only what is necessary.""

The Hanare Zen will cost you 547,800 yen (£3,600) and is available in Tokyo and the surrounding areas.

For some of the 70% of Tokyo’s population that live in apartments, and would be unable to use a construction like the Hanare Zen, working in their cars has become one way to find some peace and quiet to toil in.

Demand is up for a range of accessories to support in-vehicle working, including stands for computers that fit onto steering wheels, folding desks, mini-fans, portable batteries and screens for windows to block outside distractions.

"We want to give people living with long Covid a voice.

So today we’re launching a new global series: Living with long Covid.

We’ve asked our reporting teams based around the world to talk to long haulers to document their experiences.

We'll be sharing their stories over the next two weeks. But for now, what do we know about long Covid?

Scientists still understand little about the condition, and studies on it often vary in their results. But two and a half years since the Covid pandemic began, there are some trends starting to become clear:

• Older people appear to be at slightly higher risk of developing long Covid symptoms, notably kidney problems and mental health conditions, according to CDC research. But the risk isn’t much lower for younger people.

• People who were hospitalized with Covid-19 are probably at higher risk of developing long Covid symptoms compared with those who were not, according to a meta analysis of dozens of studies. But even people who had a mild case of Covid have a pretty good chance of experiencing long Covid symptoms.

• Women are more likely to develop long Covid symptoms, according to the meta-analysis. This is in line with previous studies showing women have a higher risk level.

• Being vaccinated may reduce your chances of developing long Covid symptoms, according to several studies. But it's not always completely clearcut, with one recent study showing a limited impact.

"Calling all customers: there's a giant food monopoly in aisle one. And two, three, four, five and six ...

We've designed this game using the findings of a joint investigation we've done with Food and Water Watch. We found that consumer choice in the US is largely an illusion – despite supermarket shelves and fridges brimming with different brands.

In fact, a few powerful transnational companies dominate every link of the food supply chain: from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to cereals and beers.

The size, power and profits of these mega companies have expanded thanks to political lobbying and weak regulation which enabled a wave of unchecked mergers and acquisitions.

This matters because the size and influence of these mega-companies enables them to largely dictate what America’s two million farmers grow and how much they are paid, as well as what consumers eat and how much our groceries cost.

"The disruption from the climate emergency being experienced by marine wildlife has seemingly reached a new high.

In the first week of the Cop26 summit, a female walrus was discovered sleeping on a Dutch submarine in a naval base in North Holland.

Freya, as the animal has been named, is the first of her species to visit the Netherlands in 23 years. Walruses normally live in the polar regions – several hundred miles north.

She was spotted snoozing on the submarine in the naval port of Den Helder by Jeroen Hoekendijk, a Dutch scientist specialising in marine mammals.

Freya is thought to have swum south from her Arctic comfort zone, following the Danish and German coasts.

While she appears to be in good health, Hoekendijk – who observed the animal feeding on razor clams earlier – noted a raw wound in her front flippers.

This particular animal is one of at least two of the species that have been seen far from their Arctic habitat. Another wandering walrus, seen off the Scilly Islands, France, Spain and West Cork in Ireland has since been sighted back in Icelandic waters.

Social media users quipped that the Arctic mammal showed an “excellent example of animal-initiated civil resistance”, and that “considering military are huge contributors to carbon emissions, the walrus is probably protesting climate justice”.

"We would just like to take a moment to pay tribute to our colleague, Kakoli Bhattacharya, an Indian journalist who was a researcher, translator, news assistant and friend to Guardian correspondents for more than a decade.

She has died from Covid-19 in Delhi after being admitted to hospital earlier last week during a catastrophic second wave of the virus in India that has claimed tens of thousands of lives since it took off in March.

Kakoli, 51, worked with every Guardian correspondent in south Asia since 2009. Her daily contributions to our journalism ranged from obtaining the phone numbers of sources with remarkable speed, translating one of the several languages she spoke fluently, accompanying correspondents in the field, and beyond.

Her work took her to the world’s largest religious festivals, on midnight patrols with “cow protection” vigilantes and on the trail of campaigning roadshows for successive Indian elections, among countless other places and stories.

Unflappable and warm, blessed with a power to persuade that few could resist, she was invaluable to the journalists she worked with closely as a right-hand woman and friend.

Kakoli was married to the celebrated Indian environmentalist Himanshu Thakkar, who she met in 1994 during protests against the building of large dams. They have two children, Hriday, 24, who has just graduated in computer science, and Khushi, 18.

She fell ill with Covid-19 last week and was moved to hospital when her oxygen levels worsened, one of more than 2,000 deaths from the virus to be officially recorded last Friday. The real death toll in India is thought to be much higher.",2021-04-27 19:00:57,"We would just like to take a moment to pay tribute to our colleague Kakoli Bhattacharya an Indian journalist who was a researcher translator news assistant and friend to Guardian correspondents for more than a decade

"What do you think of Facebook's new name: Meta?

The announcement by Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg that the social media giant will change the name of its holding company to Meta in a virtual-reality rebrand has prompted dismay and bemusement.

The rebrand comes as the company faces a series of public relations crises. A trove of recently leaked documents now known as the Facebook Papers exposed the inner workings of the company, with allegations from whistleblower Frances Haugen that Facebook has put profits ahead of ridding its platform of hate speech and misinformation.

Politicians across all party lines also joined the conversation about the controversial rebrand. New York progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez didn’t hold back in her disapproval, calling the company “a cancer to democracy” and “a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society.”

US Senator Richard Blumenthal alleged the name change was nothing more than an effort to “confuse” and “distract” but ultimately “won’t erase years of devious practices & disregard for privacy, kids’ wellbeing, spreading hate, & genocide.”

Twitter also jumped on board with the official Twitter account joking they had “big news” followed by the clarification – “lol jk still twitter”.

Zuckerberg revealed the new name at Facebook’s annual AR/VR conference on Thursday, where he outlined the company’s virtual-reality vision for the future. He said Meta would encompass Facebook as well as apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp and the virtual reality brand Oculus.

“Announcing Meta — the Facebook company’s new name,” the tech giant said in a tweet. “Meta is helping to build the metaverse, a place where we’ll play and connect in 3D. Welcome to the next chapter of social connection.”

So what exactly is the metaverse? Click the link in bio to read more – and to watch Zuckerberg's presentation video, which has now be satirised by more than a few famous figures.

"My child is questioning their gender identity. How do I deal with this?

When Carolyn Tate’s 12-year-old son told her he was transgender she didn’t believe him.

Her first reaction was that he was ‘looking for a simple explanation for his anxiety and depression'.

Five years later, Carolyn, a freelance health and parenting writer, admits that she could have handled it a lot better.

‘It’s strange suddenly calling the child you named and raised by another name and switching the pronouns, but it gets normal much more quickly than you’d think.’

Her son is now 17 and undergoing gender-affirming treatment — Carolyn says it’s the happiest she’s seen him since he was a child.

‘I may have missed my chance to show up for him as he needed me five years ago, but the road is long and I’m always learning.’

"“The more people know about box turtles, the more friends they have.”

Turtle tracker John Rucker and his six Boykin spaniels are on a mission to keep box turtles, North Carolina’s official state reptile, safe from threats to their natural habitat in the 1,000-acre Sherwood Forest neighborhood.

A species in decline, the slow-living box turtle is vulnerable to everything we do as humans.

And because they’re camouflaged and relatively secretive, they are hard to find, which makes studying their population and health inherently difficult.

But with the help of his dogs, 74-year-old Rucker is determined to keep his “kinship” with the turtles going.

"Would you consider putting your pet on a vegan diet? 

According to a new research, they are healthier and safer for dogs than conventional meat-based diets, as long as they are nutritionally complete.

More than 2,500 dogs were followed over a year with their owners completing surveys for the study, which has been labelled as the 'largest' of its kind to date.

According to the peer-reviewed analysis vegan dogs visited the vet less often and required fewer medications.

Almost half the dogs fed conventional meat-based diets required non-routine medication but only a third of the dogs fed vegan diets did so.

Prof Andrew Knight, at the University of Winchester, UK, who led the study said: “It revealed that the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs are nutritionally sound vegan diets.""

But Knight did add that further research is needed to confirm the findings.

“The key limitation of our study is that we didn’t have a population of animals locked up in a research facility and fed one specific diet without any alteration ... we studied what real dogs in normal homes ate and their health outcomes. It gives us a good indication as to what the outcomes are for dogs in the real world.”

An increasing number of pet owners are considering changing their animal's diets because of the damaging impact of overconsumption of meat on the environment, as well as rising concerns over how farm animals are treated. About $9bn (£6.9bn) of vegan pet food was sold worldwide in 2020 and the sector is growing fast.

Justine Shotton, the president of the British Veterinary Association, added that: “There is a lot of ongoing research in the field of vegan dog diets and this paper adds to the body of evidence supporting its benefits. However, there is currently a lack of robust data mapping the health consequences of feeding a vegan diet to a large number of dogs over many years.”

“Although we would not recommend it, it is theoretically possible to feed a dog a vegetarian diet, but owners would need to take expert veterinary advice to avoid dietary deficiencies and associated disease.""

"Lekiji, a remote village set between the Ewaso and Nanyuki rivers in thorny scrubland in Kenya, is a place of natural beauty and a rich prehistoric heritage dating back millions of years, but the area’s natural resources are diminishing.

There is no secondary school, which means that most children end their formal education at primary school level and teenage marriage is common, particularly for girls. Healthcare is expensive and hard to access - including vital services needed for family planning.

"Scaling walls and scaffolding, ""parkour climate activists"" in Paris are using their skills to turn off store signs with the aim of sending a message about light pollution.

With a strict curfew from 6pm to 6am in place across France, few people can be found walking along the usually bustling Champs-Élysées in the capital. Despite this, many of the stores lining the avenue have continued to keep their illuminated signs and window displays on through the night.

The signs caught the ire of the “On The Spot” collective - eight practitioners of the urban acrobatic sport parkour - and they decided to take things into their own hands, or feet.

“Turning off the lights is a symbolic message about the basic efforts that businesses should be making,” Kevin Ha, a 28-year-old completing his PhD in oceanography and the leader of the group said. “It’s not the efficiency of the operation that matters. Obviously we cannot turn off all the lights in Paris, but we hope to show how even small actions can make a difference.”

Ha emphasised, however, that people should not attempt to climb buildings or walls unless properly trained, saying: “Don’t try this at home kids.”

"“To them, we owe … the history of our country, of our fatherland”.

A statue of the explorer Christopher Columbus, which stood on one of Mexico City's main boulevards, is set to be replaced by one of an indigenous woman.

The city's Mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, said a new statue of an Olmec woman will aim to deliver ""social justice"" for the historic role of women in Mexico, especially indigenous women.

The Olmec people are believed to be one of the country's first major civilisations.

Columbus, an Italian-born explorer, has become a symbol of oppression and colonialism and the statue was a regular target of demonstrators protesting against the suppression of Mexico’s Indigenous civilisations.

Sculptor Pedro Reyes, who has been given the job of creating the new monument said; ""It's very important to dedicate a monument to indigenous women and to the Earth, because if anyone can teach us how to take care of this planet, it's our native peoples, and that is precisely what we must learn again"".

"“This island is me, and I am this island,” Wadhuam Pabai Pabai (pictured on the left) says of the homeland he’s known all his life.

“I can’t imagine being forced to leave Boigu … there are 65,000 years of wealth and experience here,” the father of seven says. Losing Boigu, his home in the Torres Strait, will mean losing all of it.

He and fellow islander Wadhuam Paul Kabai (pictured on the right), are leading a class action on behalf of their island communities, arguing the commonwealth of Australia is acting unlawfully in failing to stop climate change that, if unchecked, will destroy their homelands.

They are drawing inspiration - if not direct precedent – from a case from the Netherlands know as the Urgenda case. This is where 886 plaintiffs argued the Dutch government had an obligation to protect its citizens from the impacts of climate change. That case, challenged all the way to the country’s supreme court by the government, succeeded at every level.

The result was a dramatic shift in Dutch government policy – including the closure of coal-fired power stations, billions of euros of investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and binding commitments towards emissions reductions. Similar cases have followed in Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Germany, France, New Zealand, and elsewhere.

But the Urgenda decision relied significantly on the European Convention on Human Rights – particularly articles two and eight, safeguarding the rights to life, and to a private and family life. That law does not apply to Australia, but lawyers will argue the commonwealth of Australia has a legal “duty of care” towards Torres Strait Islander peoples, arising both from negligence law and the Torres Strait Treaty and Native Title.

"New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard made history on Monday night - becoming the first openly transgender woman to compete in the Olympics.

In a rare interview with international media after her appearance in the over-87kg final, which had been the subject of controversy and scrutiny, Hubbard, said: ""We are human and, as such, I hope that just being here is enough.""

""I don't think it should be historic. I think as we move into a new and more understanding world, people are starting to realise that people like me are just people.""

Hubbard, 43, failed with attempts to lift 120kg and two at 125kg in the snatch as she made a quick exit from the competition. China's Li lifted an Olympic record of 320kg to take the gold medal, with Britain's Emily Campbell claiming silver and American Sarah Robles winning bronze.

After the event, Hubbard said she planned to retire from the sport, adding that she had never sought publicity, nor regards herself a role model or trailblazer, but just wants to be treated like any other athlete on sport's biggest stage.

"'A renewed sense of community'

When the pandemic hit, some Indigenous and African-Ecuadorian families returned to the rural places they were born as they were often the safest place to be. But, there was problem, many schools in these isolated villages and towns had closed.

The response? Parents and young locals relaunched community schools that promoted cultural identity and language, and the protection of the local environment.

Photographer @johis.alarcon, who is based in Ecuador, says she discovered a renewed sense of community on her visits to the Indigenous village of San Clemente in the Andean highlands and the African-Ecuadorean hamlet of Playa de Oro in the coastal rainforest bordering Colombia

"Is this a future we're willing to accept?

The land on which 10% of the world's population lives could be lost to rising sea levels, according to new projections by @climatecentral.

The non-profit group has produced a collection of images which visualize what future sea level rise could look like if collectively we fail to meet carbon emissions reduction targets.

Fifty major cities, mostly in Asia, and at least one large nation on every continent but Australia and Antarctica are at risk. Many small island nations are threatened with near total loss of their land - taking with them the heritage and history of these coastal communities.

Meeting the most ambitious goals of the Paris climate agreement could reduce the sea level rise exposure by roughly half. But the world is not on course to limiting global warming to 1.5C (2.7F), as outlined in the 2015 Paris agreement.

Based on current emissions, the Earth is expected to reach and even exceed 3C (5.4F) warming by 2100.

“A picture is worth 1,000 words, or 1,000 years in this case,” says Benjamin Strauss, the CEO and chief scientist at Climate Central.

Next month, representatives from every country in the world will meet in Glasgow for the Cop26 climate conference, where parties will be expected to commit to goals in response to the ongoing climate emergency.

“The decisions that we make at Glasgow and the actions that we take this decade will ramify for hundreds and thousands of years,” Strauss said. “This group is going to be remembered for what they chose: did you choose a thriving future with a liveable climate or did you choose to drown the coastal places of the world?”

The world is burning … but countries continue to invest in major fossil fuel projects, a Guardian investigation has found. 

Rather than reducing emissions, companies around the world have committed to oil and gas projects which will produce devastating amounts of CO2 and stay within the goal of 1.5C.

These projects are known as “carbon bombs”.

As a result, temperatures will rise which increases the risk of extreme heatwaves, droughts and floods that are already affecting people worldwide. 

But there is still time to turn this around, says Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor, who worked on the investigation. “It’s not quite too late, but we have a very, very very small window of time to act.”

“It’s not technicalities or the legal side that are stopping this from changing. It’s the political will. That’s the good news, in a way: we know what the solution is. But that is as far as the good news goes.”

"Halyna Hutchins was a talented and passionate cinematographer who was clearly enjoying her job as director of photography on Alec Baldwin’s latest cowboy movie, Rust. 

The 42-year-old died on the set of the film yesterday after Baldwin - an actor and producer of the film - fired a prop gun in an accident that also injured its director, authorities have said.

Over the past three weeks, Hutchins posted photos on her Instagram account from the film’s rugged set in the foothills of New Mexico. They included vivid sunsets and a cast and crew picture in which Hutchins is standing next to Baldwin against the backdrop a log cabin.

There is also a short video clip taken on Wednesday in which Hutchins – wearing a grey scarf and wide-brimmed hat – sets off on horseback with colleagues. “One of the perks of shooting a western is you get to ride horses on your day off,” she wrote.

Born in Ukraine in 1979 when the country was part of the Soviet Union, Hutchins’ journey from the USSR to Hollywood was an improbable one. She grew up on a military base in the Arctic Circle surrounded by reindeer and nuclear submarines. An “army brat”, she said she got interested in film because “there wasn’t that much to do outside”.

Hutchins started her career as a reporter after studying international journalism at Kyiv National University. She worked on several British film productions in eastern Europe, travelling to remote locations, and saw how the cinematographer worked.

“I was fascinated with storytelling based on real characters,” she said. A self-confessed adrenaline junkie, Hutchins documented her forays into extreme sports including parachuting and cave exploration. A decade or so ago, she decided to concentrate on film-making full-time and moved to California.

According to American Cinematographer, Hutchins took whatever production jobs she could find. She also dabbled in fashion photography to learn more about what she called the “aesthetics of lighting – how you create the mood, the feeling”.

"“In Brazil, there are at least glimmers of hope,” writes our global environment editor Jonathan Watts.

In June, the government celebrated a 34% fall in Amazon deforestation rates since Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was elected president at the start of the year. Now the figures for July are on course to be even better, the environment minister, Marina Silva, has told the Guardian, there has been decrease of more than 60% compared with the same month last year.

The exact figure, which is based on the Deter satellite alert system, will be released in the coming days. But independent analysts described the preliminary data as “incredible” and said the improvement compared with the same month last year could be the best since 2005.

The rapid progress highlights the importance of political change. A year ago, under the far-right then president, Jair Bolsonaro, the Amazon was suffering one of the worst cutting and burning seasons in recent history.

Bolsonaro has been accused of “annihilating environmental policy”, which has had a severe impact on Brazil’s indigenous population like the Yanomami people.

Since a new administration led by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took power at the start of the year, the government has penalised land grabbers, mounted paramilitary operations to drive out illegal miners, demarcated more indigenous land and created more conservation areas.

However, as Watts explains: “Brazil’s agribusiness-dominated Congress has undermined the chances of future gains by gutting the authority of the environment ministry, and the lower house passed a bill to limit recognition of Indigenous lands. These contradictory signals are not conducive to growth – ecological or economic.”

"Athletes and other public figures have spoken out in support of Naomi Osaka after she announced her withdrawal from the French Open in order to preserve her mental health.

The world number two withdrew from the grand slam tournament a day after they fined her $15,000 for not speaking with the press.

Osaka, 23, who won her first match against Patricia Maria Tig and was scheduled to face Ana Bogdan in the second round, had released a statement last Wednesday stating her intention to skip her media obligations during the event because of the effects of her interactions with the press on her mental health.

In her withdrawal statement, the four-times grand slam champion said she has suffered from “long bouts of depression” since the 2018 US Open final.

“Anyone that knows me knows I’m introverted, and anyone that has seen me at the tournaments will notice that I’m often wearing headphones as that helps dull my social anxiety,” Osaka wrote.

Osaka concluded her statement by saying she suffers “huge waves of anxiety” before speaking with the media. “So here in Paris I was already feeling vulnerable and anxious so I thought it was better to exercise self‑care and skip the press conferences. I announced it preemptively because I do feel like the rules are quite outdated in parts and I wanted to highlight that.""

"Exclusive: millions of lives could be saved by a groundbreaking set of new vaccines for a range of conditions including cancer, experts have said.

A leading pharmaceutical firm said it is confident that jabs for cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, and other conditions will be ready by 2030.

Studies into these vaccinations are also showing “tremendous promise”, with some researchers saying 15 years’ worth of progress has been “unspooled” in 12 to 18 months thanks to the success of the Covid jab.

Dr Paul Burton, the chief medical officer of pharmaceutical company Moderna, said he believes the firm will be able to offer such treatments for “all sorts of disease areas” in as little as five years.

The firm, which created one of the leading coronavirus vaccines, is developing cancer vaccines that target different tumour types.

Burton said: “We will have that vaccine and it will be highly effective, and it will save many hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. I think we will be able to offer personalised cancer vaccines against multiple different tumour types to people around the world.”

He also said that multiple respiratory infections could be covered by a single injection – allowing vulnerable people to be protected against Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – while mRNA therapies could be available for rare diseases for which there are currently no drugs.

"This has been the unexpected hit over the weekend - a Soviet television adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, which was thought to have been lost to time.

Instead it was been rediscovered and posted onto 5TV's YouTube last week, delighting Russian-language fans of JRR Tolkien.

The 1991 made-for-TV film, Khraniteli, based on Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring, is the only adaptation of his Lord of the Rings trilogy believed to have been made in the Soviet Union.

Aired 10 years before the release of the first instalment of Peter Jackson’s movie trilogy, the low-budget film appears ripped from another age: the costumes and sets are rudimentary, the special effects are ludicrous, and many of the scenes look more like a theatre production than a feature-length film.

"This star is 30 times as big as our sun – and this image captures the rare and fleeting phase of it on the cusp of death.

The observation was among the first made by the James Webb space telescope following its launch in late 2021, but the picture was not released until this week.

This star in the constellation Sagitta, officially known as WR 124, already has shed enough material to account for 10 suns, according to Nasa.

Webb’s infrared eyes observed all the gas and dust flung into space by a huge, hot star 15,000 light years away. A light year is about 5.8tn miles.

Shimmering in purple like a cherry blossom, the cast-off material once comprised the star’s outer layer. The Hubble space telescope snapped a shot of the same transitioning star a few decades ago, but it appeared more like a fireball without the delicate details.

Such a transformation occurs only with some stars and normally is the last step before they explode, going supernova, according to scientists.

On the streets of São Paulo last night, Lula supporters spoke to our correspondent @tomphillipsin on what his victory means for the Brazil - and for their future.

All eyes have been on the outcome of the election, with the future of the Amazon rainforest and its impact on the global climate emergency at stake.

Lula’s return to power over far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro follows a string of leftwing gains in Latin America. Gustavo Petro, who became Colombia’s first leftist president after his election this summer, tweeted simply: “Long live Lula”.

"Fifty years ago, on 15 September 1971, a ship named the Greenpeace set out to confront and stop US nuclear weapons testing at Amchitka, one of the Aleutian Islands in south-west Alaska.

Photographers had been using their images for years to publicise situations around the world. But as a young organisation - pioneering a new kind of activism - @greenpeace began to realise that capturing images of what they were doing and seeing would play a vital role in their work.

The campaigners quickly learned how to harness the power and strength of emotive images bringing the world shocking scenes of seal pups clubbed by hunters and the inspirational images of activists standing up to whaling ships, including the image on the cover of this gallery show them trying to hinder the shooting of a minke whale in 2005.

"If a week is a long time in politics, the past year has been an eternity for Jerome Foster.

Every Friday for 58 weeks in a row, the 18-year-old was holding forlorn protests outside the White House calling for action on global heating. Now, the computer science student has been ushered into the seat of American power to help craft climate policy.

In a sign of the growing political clout of the youth climate movement that has blossomed around the world, Foster has been included among a group of advisers to Joe Biden who will inform the US president on issues related to environmental justice, where low-income communities and people of colour face the greatest fallout from climate change and pollution.

“I didn’t expect this to happen so soon, it was like, ‘Wow, this is crazy,’” said Foster, who posted a tweet summing up the dramatic upgrade in his influence.

@JeromeFosterII added: “I’m the only person under 40 on the whole panel, so when I got there I was like, ‘Am I supposed to be here?’ But it was their intention to bring in the youth perspective on climate change. I was a bit startled at first but now I’m getting used to it.”

"“I didn’t think I’d ever get to go up.""

A trailblazing female pilot, denied the job of astronaut in the 1960s over her gender, is finally getting the chance to fulfil her dreams of going into space.

Billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has announced that 82-year-old Wally Funk will be part of a four-person crew set to be launched into space by Blue Origin during a 10-minute flight on his rocket New Shepard later this month.

Funk, who says she taught over 3,000 people to fly, will be the oldest person ever to travel into space, after the late John Glenn set the current record at age 77 while aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998.

In 1961, Funk volunteered to be part of a program to get women to qualify for Nasa’s astronaut program, but it was abruptly cancelled when the federal government decided women shouldn’t be allowed to use the military facilities needed for space training.

None of the women ever made it into space – but now, Funk has the opportunity to do so on 20 July.

“No one has waited longer,” said Bezos in his post, calling Funk an “honored guest”.

"“One of the worst pages in the history of the Italian republic.""

That's how Pina Picierno, a Democratic party member of the European parliament, described Italy's senate decision to vote down an anti-homophobic violence bill.

The senate has killed off a bill that would have made violence against LGBT people and disabled people, as well as misogyny, a hate crime.

The 315-member senate voted by 154 to 131 on Wednesday to block the debate on the law, named after the gay centre-left Democratic party (PD) legislator Alessandro Zan. It was previously approved by the lower house of parliament in the face of months of protests from far-right and Catholic groups.

According to the far-right parties that voted against the bill in the upper house, the law would have suppressed freedom of expression and promoted “homosexual propaganda” in schools.

Last June, the Vatican made an unprecedented intervention urging the Italian government to change the law over concerns it would infringe upon the Catholic church’s “freedom of thought”.

Debate over the approval of the bill, which would lead to people convicted of such crimes being jailed for up to four years and permit an increase in funding for groups that work to fight against discrimination and assist people who are the victims of it, came after a series of high-profile attacks against gay and transgender people.

Rights groups receive hundreds of hate crime reports each year but many go unpunished. Although Italy approved same-sex civil unions in 2016, the country has lagged behind its EU partners in creating anti-homophobia measures.

Attempts by various governments over the past three decades to enact a similar law have either been stifled or sabotaged, with any progress or even just meaningful debate stymied by a macho culture, Catholicism and support for far-right parties.

"A hospital in New York will at least temporarily stop delivering babies later this month, after too many employees resigned over a rule that made Covid-19 vaccinations compulsory.

“The number of resignations received leaves us no choice but to pause delivering babies at Lewis county general hospital,” chief executive of the Lewis County Health System, told reporters.

Amid alarm over the highly infectious Delta variant and continued evidence that vaccines are both safe and effective, New York state has required healthcare workers to be vaccinated.

The mandate makes room for medical exemptions but excludes religious ones. Hospitals and nursing homes must comply by 27 September.

Nearly three quarters of staff in the Lewis County Health System have received the jab, including 30 employees after the mandate was announced in August. But another 30 have resigned – 21 from clinical areas – and 165 remain unvaccinated, leaders say.

Already chronically short-staffed, the Lewis county general hospital maternity department took a debilitating hit after six employees resigned from the obstetrics service. Another seven are still deciding whether to get vaccinated or leave.

Patients may now have to rely on other facilities for maternity and postpartum care. Other departments are at risk and the hospital strongly encourages staff to get the shot.

"A historic vote granting equal marriage rights to same-sex couples in Chile has been heralded by activists as a triumph and a blow to the conservative agenda of presidential candidate José Antonio Kast.

“Marriage equality is a ray of sunshine, a bit of hope,” said Isabel Amor, director of the gay rights organization Iguales, who said that the country’s LGBTQ+ community is in a “very fragile emotional state” with the threat of a Kast presidency. “We have to ask what we will lose if he gets the presidency.”

Kast won a plurality of votes in November’s first-round vote – taking 28% of the vote and beating the progressive former student leader Gabriel Boric by two percentage points – an outcome that sent a wave of fear through the country’s LGBTQ+ community. A tight runoff between Kast and Boric is scheduled for 19 December.

While Boric advocates greater rights for minorities, Kast’s agenda is founded upon traditionalist politics formed by devout Catholic values.

Kast, who denies he is homophobic, has said that “society works best with heterosexual couples”; his presidential program offers subsidies to married heterosexual families with children, deliberately excluding same-sex couples.

During his 16 years as a deputy, he resisted progressive legislation, voting against an anti-discrimination law in 2012 and the Civil Union agreement in 2015 – both of which were eventually passed. He fiercely opposed the gender identity bill, which was passed in 2018 to give legal protections to trans people.

The equal marriage bill, expected to be signed into law before March, will allow same-sex couples parental rights, which was not possible under the Civil Union act. It was first submitted by Michelle Bachelet’s government in 2017 but was neglected by lawmakers until given urgent status by president Sebastian Piñera in June.

Piñera previously opposed the law but said “life” and “meeting people” had led him to change his mind.

Chile is the sixth nation in South America to legalize same-sex marriage, joining Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador.

"Peeing in space is 'very easy' ...

That's according to Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa who has recently returned to Earth after spending 12 days on the International Space station (ISS).

@yusaku2020 documented his space travel earlier this month and made videos performing mundane tasks, including eating snacks and going to the toilet.

Maezawa is an online fashion tycoon who was helped into space by a Russian space agency team. His assistant Yozo Hirano and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin also joined his crew alongside a seven-team crew who were engaged in space biology and physics research.

The journey marked Russia’s return to space tourism after a decade-long pause that saw the rise of competition from the US as the commercial space tourism industry is growing.

This year, billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson all made breakthrough commercial tourism flights, bursting into a market Russia is keen to defend.

The cost of tickets to space for tourists has not been disclosed but US-based company Space Adventures has indicated they are in the range of $50m-60m.

"“As a relatively wealthy country, the UK should not have residents facing a choice of whether to feed their families or heat their homes.”

This is what one Guardian reader told us about why they're donating to our annual charity appeal.

We are raising money for grassroots charities providing much-needed support services to people struggling at the frontline of the cost of living crisis, via our two charity partners, Citizens Advice UK and Locality.

An incredible £500,000 has been donated already to our appeal by generous Guardian and Observer readers, with many people telling us that to them donating has been an expression of anger and frustration with the government for not enough being done to support families on low incomes.

For some this is also about simple human compassion. “Times are hard and a little kindness is needed,” added one of our readers.

Donations will go to local voluntary organisations working in some of the UK’s most deprived areas, which are providing crisis support ranging from food banks and warm rooms to debt and housing advice and mental health help.

"Do you think this is a ""game changer""?

Lawmakers in Portugal have passed new rules which say companies must avoid contacting workers outside office hours, as well as contribute to expenses resulting from remote working, such as electricity and internet bills.

Under the new labour laws – passed by parliament as a result of the explosion in home-working – employers could face fines for contacting staff after work, except under exceptional circumstances.

Portugal's ruling Socialist Party have also decided that companies should be forbidden from monitoring their staff while they work at home.

The new rules won't however apply to companies with fewer than ten employees.

Speaking to the Web Summit Conference in Lisbon last week, Portugal's minister of labour and social security, said: ""The pandemic has accelerated the need to regulate what needs to be regulated,"" she said.

""Telework can be a 'game changer' if we profit from the advantages and reduce the disadvantages"".

""We consider Portugal one of the best places in the world for these digital nomads and remote workers to choose to live in, we want to attract them to Portugal,"" she told the Web Summit audience.

"Summer festivalgoers are being warned that an “unprecedented shift” in the drug market caused by a combination of Brexit, Covid lockdowns and police operations against supply chains has led to a sharp and potentially harmful increase in fake MDMA.

Criminologists and chemists have found that 45% of substances sold as MDMA (ecstasy) at festivals in England last year did not contain any of the drug. 

By comparison, in 2019 – when the research was carried out at the same festivals – only 7% of the pills tested did not contain MDMA.

In the first peer-reviewed scientific study of the trend, experts say many pills bought by partygoers as MDMA were made up of ingredients such as cathinones, a new psychoactive substance (NPS), and caffeine. 

Some users reported ill-effects such as panic, psychosis and prolonged insomnia.

The main plank of the research is fieldwork carried out by the drug-checking charity @theloop_uk, whose researchers visited three English music festivals in summer 2021 and tested hundreds of pills that buyers had believed were MDMA in a mobile laboratory.

The scientists warn that with the impact of Brexit still being keenly felt on legal and illegal markets, suppliers may continue to flood festivals and other events with fake MDMA, posing risks to users.

"Rupert Murdoch, the US global media magnate, is stepping down at the age of 92 from the global media empire that he started expanding in his native Australia at the age of 21, it was announced on Thursday.

In a note to staff first reported in the Murdoch-controlled Wall Street Journal, he wrote: “For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on different roles.”

After decades of wrangling and the smash-hit television drama series Succession that appeared to mirror all too closely the power struggles of the Murdoch business clan, one of the most powerful media and, by extension, political figures of the 20th and 21st centuries is handing over the keys to his eldest son Lachlan. His younger son, James, resigned from the News Corp board in 2020.

Murdoch’s publicly-traded company News Corp, headquartered in New York, owns hundreds of local, national and international news outlets. In the US the company owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post conservative-leaning tabloid, as well as the book publisher HarperCollins. In the UK he owns The Sun and The Times and owned the News of the World.

In the television business, News Corp also owns the US’s right-wing channel Fox News, through the Fox Corporation, and, down under, Sky News Australia. Murdoch was the owner of Britain’s Sky News until 2018 and the film company now called 21st Century Fox until 2019.

"""We didn’t want to tell another story of poverty,"" says the founder of @chessinslums  @tundeonakoya_. ""We wanted to tell a new story of the children that live [in Makoko], not because of their background, but because of the potential that they wield.""

What do you think of when you think of chess?

For Nigerian chess master Tunde Onakoya the game is a ""great equaliser"". He has set up a charity called Chess in Slums Africa to empower young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Lagos - and to change perceptions.

Addressing the @youthhubafrica DARE conference in Abuja last September, Onakoya explained he had started teaching chess to kids in the Makoko slum in Lagos, along with providing arithmetic lessons and scholarship opportunities, to give them ""the required education and skills that they need to create the future that they desire for themselves"".

Widespread poverty has meant education is often not a priority for children in Makoko - an issue that has only been made worse by economic hardship caused by Covid, rising food prices and a lack of government support.

But the programme, which started last February, has taught over 200 children and transformed the lives of many students. In March, chess master and president of the @mitpics chess club Tyrone Davis III visited the project and offered to sponsor 13-year-old chess prodigy Benjamin’s education until university.

Chess in Slums Africa has now worked across Lagos, including teaching chess to homeless children living in the notoriously crime-ridden Oshodi underpass, and aims to train over 1 million children in the space of five years.

"The ordinary mint chocolate frappe, once a harmless treat, has become caught in a political storm in Thailand.

Cafes across Bangkok have suspended their sales of the iced drink – known to be a favourite of the opposition Pheu Thai party’s prime ministerial candidate – while others have rebranded it as a “betray-your-friend” drink, or a drink to “kick your friend into the boat”, a phrase that means to push a friend away.

On social media, people have asked the cafes to “please stop selling it permanently” and applauded their bravery.

But why? From Bangkok, our reporter @rebeccalroot explains.

"“Who needs a trip to Iceland when you can see the northern lights from upper Wensleydale”?

This is what one Twitter user posted when the the northern lights, or aurora borealis, appeared in the night sky across Britain on Sunday in a rare display that reached parts of southern England.

The aurora is usually most visible near the Earth’s magnetic north and south poles when high-speed electrically charged particles from space collide with gas molecules in Earth’s upper atmosphere.

People share their sightings of the vibrant spectacle, which is expected to repeat on Monday night.

"Wish you weren’t here?

Overtourism has long been a problem across the world’s travel hotspots – but now besieged cities are starting to fight back.

In the 20 years running up to Covid, international tourism doubled, to 2.4 billion arrivals in 2019. Overall, tourism last year was at 63% of its pre-Covid levels. Numbers this year are expected to be almost exactly as they were four years ago, 38.5 million.

Every location has a different challenge with tourists. On Catalan beaches, it may be that they are wearing too many clothes; in Barcelona, there are simply too many people. Whether that turns the entire place into a giant hotel or a human traffic-jam, it is impossible to imagine that being a pleasant, livable experience for the host citizens.

Jon Henley, the Guardian’s Europe correspondent, based in Paris, says” wherever you’ve got a medieval city centre, those become unbearable.”

Meanwhile, Amsterdam is at the vanguard of the growing “stay-away” movement. The city council decided this summer to close the cruise ship terminal in the city centre, specifically citing its sustainability goals, and has actively discouraged young British men who want a ‘messy’ weekend from visiting.

When tourists flock to a place, do they change its character, wipe out its idiosyncrasies, without even noticing what those idiosyncrasies are? Can you commodify beauty without tainting it?

"'It’s not just white dudes with guitars any more.'

Emo music spawned a culture rooted in a dark, fragile aesthetic that saw teens emerging from bedrooms in black skinny jeans and band T-shirts, brushing flat-ironed hair away from their kohled eyes.

But as with other rock subgenres, fans say the racial politics of the scene have long been fraught. Though the music is embraced by those who feel like outcasts, the emo scene hasn’t always felt welcoming to people of color.

""I’ve played shows and been to shows where people are wearing white pride T-shirts,” says Andy Lawson, 29.

Bipoc (Black, Indigenous and people of color) Emo Night is changing the narrative, says Hanz Odaga, a collective member who was born in Uganda and now lives in New Jersey.

"These are four of Notting Hill Carnival's matriarchs - Allyson Williams, Sister Monica Tywang, Lady Lee Woolford Chivers and Kim Woolford.

For decades, each of them helped pioneer and define London's celebration of Caribbean culture - and Europe’s largest street festival.

This year the event, which would normally take place today and tomorrow, has moved online for a second year running after it was cancelled as a result of the pandemic.

Sister Monica Tywang, who has been associated with carnival since 1975, says it was known as the ""annual pilgrimage"".

“We didn’t have the ways of communicating then that we have today, so everybody looked forward to coming to Notting Hill, to meet other Caribbean people and to celebrate our culture.”

London's first carnival was held in 1959 in response to a series of racist attacks and rioting that spread from Nottingham to west London, where white youths targeted black people.

It is now an indelible part of the British cultural calendar - with around a million people usually descending on west London for the celebration.

For carnival institution and “Queen of Mas” Allyson Williams, the event is a family affair. In 1974, she met her husband Vernon there, who founded Genesis, one of Notting Hill’s longest-standing bands, in 1980; since his death in 2002, Allyson has led the band alongside her daughter.

“Marrying a Trinidadian was a dream come true,” she says. “I want my children to understand our legacy: the legacy of slavery, where I came from, to understand the culture of steel band and carnival.”

While technology will do its best to recreate the carnival atmosphere this August bank holiday weekend, the matriarchs are already looking ahead to next year’s event. All have given their lives to a celebration of freedom, one they’re looking forward to returning to without restriction.

"For Manchester City, it was the crowning glory, the trophy that they have craved to complete the ultimate set. It is often said that clubs must suffer before they win the Champions League and how City have done so, especially during the Pep Guardiola years when domestic dominance has brought no guarantees in Europe’s elite and most capricious competition.

They suffered some more here, Internazionale pushing them all the way, much further than many had expected. The team that finished third in Serie A were the equal of City for much of a high-stress night here in Istanbul.

There was a moment just before the hour when Guardiola sank to his knees as Lautaro Martínez rushed up the left only to shoot too close to Ederson. It was a long way from being the kind of crushing City performance that Premier League supporters have grown used to.

It was only about the result and City found a way to it through the force of their personality. It had become increasingly clear that one moment could be all that either side needed and City made it happen when Manuel Akanji played in Bernardo Silva up the right and when his pull-back deflected, there was Rodri, running on to the loose ball to send a low shot fizzing home.

"‘I know you've never faced those choices, nor have you ever been pregnant’.

This is what White House press secretary Jen Psaki said when pressed by a male reporter about why President Biden, a Catholic, supports abortion rights.

The US president condemned the supreme court decision not to consider a Texas law that in effect bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.

'It's a woman's body and it's her choice. I know you've never faced those choices, nor have you ever been pregnant,' said Psaki adding that the president believed a woman's choices should be respected.

"Sea turtles on the sandy shores of western Senegal have made a rapid comeback because of quieter beaches during the coronavirus pandemic.

With less activity and less light from the nearby hotels, more turtles have come to lay their eggs on the beach in the villages like Guéréo. 

Fifteen turtles nested on Guéréo's beach last season, up from just two the previous year. 

Turtle nests are appearing in greater numbers than ever before along West Africa's shores. 

Increased fishing, tourism and construction have deterred Senegal's three species of turtle, all of which appear on International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List.

And while they have appeared in greater numbers than ever before due to the Covid pandemic, all species of turtles in Senegal and in the world remain threatened and endangered. 

Charlotte Thomas, a turtle researcher at the Oceanium marine conservation organisation in Dakar, says; ""turtles play the role of ocean cleaner. They regulate marine algae by eating them, and marine algae is depended upon by lot on other species such as tuna, lobster and shrimp. If these turtles were to disappear, that would create an imbalance in the food chain and threaten the entire ecosystem.""

"“I’ll fight like a lioness”

No one does political rags to riches stories quite like Brazil, but even in a nation where the most celebrated president in decades once shined shoes to survive, the story of Erika Hilton takes some beating.

As a teenager she came out to her family as transgender and was kicked out of her home aged 14. She spent several years as a sex worker in rural Brazil before reconnecting with her mother and studying teaching and gerontology at university. 

Discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ communities in Brazil are widespread and the country has the highest levels of violence against trans people in the world. 

In the face of this stark reality, Hilton moved into student politics, joined the leftwing PSOL party and in 2020 became the first transgender person elected to the city council, Brazil’s largest.

Now, as the country heads to the polls in this Sunday’s general election, the activist and politician hopes the vote will not only mark the end of the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro’s presidency, but will also see her elected to a Congress with the leftist Lula da Silva at the helm.

Watch our new film on the significance of Hilton’s journey - and exactly what is at stake at this election - via the link in our bio.

"What do you think governments should be doing to combat loneliness?

With its campaign 'One Against Loneliness', the Dutch government has encouraged organisations, businesses, and towns to find solutions to a growing number of people feeling lonely, particularly among the elderly.

The Netherlands has around 1.3m people over the age of 75, half of whom said they regularly feel lonely.

Enter 'Kletskassa' which translates to 'chat checkout'. The concept began a couple of years ago at the supermarket chain Jumbo.

After noticing a positive response from customers, the chain has now announced there will be 'chat checkouts' in 200 stores across The Netherlands.

Colette Cloosterman-van Eerd, CCO of Jumbo said: “Our stores are an important meeting place for many people and we want to play a role in identifying and reducing loneliness.

""We are proud that many of our cashiers like to take a seat behind a Kletskassa. They support the initiative and want to help people to make real contact with them out of genuine interest. It is a small gesture, but very valuable, especially in a world that is digitizing and getting faster and faster.”

This is far from just a Dutch problem. Globally 41% of people reported becoming lonelier over the previous six months from March 2020.

With its campaign One Against Loneliness the Dutch government has encouraged organisations businesses and towns to find solutions to a growing number of people feeling lonely particularly among the elderly

The Netherlands has around 13m people over the age of 75 half of whom said they regularly feel lonely

Enter Kletskassa which translates to chat checkout The concept began a couple of years ago at the supermarket chain Jumbo

After noticing a positive response from customers the chain has now announced there will be chat checkouts in 200 stores across The Netherlands

Colette Cloostermanvan Eerd CCO of Jumbo said Our stores are an important meeting place for many people and we want to play a role in identifying and reducing loneliness

We are proud that many of our cashiers like to take a seat behind a Kletskassa They support the initiative and want to help people to make real contact with them out of genuine interest It is a small gesture but very valuable especially in a world that is digitizing and getting faster and faster

"It was a beautifully simple idea: one family, photographed at the same time every year. 

In the summer of 1991, photographer @zed_nelson, then 25, invited a couple of new parents he'd met at a party to visit his London studio. Oh, and bring your newborn baby, he said.

He would chart the evolution of a parenting life, with Sue fixed in position on the right of the picture, Frank on the left, Eddie inching up between his mum and dad. “Same backdrop, same lights, same camera, same angle,” Nelson explains, adding: “Every year I measure out the distances to the inch. It drives us all a bit mad. But we do keep coming back.”

When Sue looks back at the very earliest photograph in the selection, she remembers the intense sensation of parental duty. “When you first have a child, you think it’s going to go on for ever, just because of that intensity. Actually, the three decades since then have gone in a flash. Like a movie on fast forward. These photos make me realise the sheer speed of time passing.”

“When we started, it was a pre-digital era, pre-internet,” says Frank, “and we didn’t give any thought to what would happen in the future. There’s no way, all those years ago, we would have asked ourselves: ‘What will this all look like in 2021?’”

"This is Karapiru Awá Guajá. A man who has lived an extraordinary life and inspired so many along the way.

He survived a massacre that killed most of his family in the Brazilian Amazon and lived for 10 years alone in the forest, but Karapiru could not escape the pandemic.

One of the last of the hunter-gatherer nomadic Awá of Maranhão state, he died of Covid-19 earlier this month. With only 300 Awá thought to remain, they have been called the “earth’s most threatened tribe”.

Survival International, a group working for the rights of indigenous people, describes Karapiru’s “extraordinary warmth and kindness”.

Awá lands have been under attack since the discovery of iron ore in the late 1960s. The scale of the mining development gouged from the Amazon is such that it can be seen from space.

In the 1970s, Karapiru lost almost everyone he knew in a genocidal attack on his tribe by settlers.

After the massacre, Karapiru spent 10 years alone, eating honey, small birds and sleeping in the boughs of copaiba trees and among the orchids.

Marina Magalhães, a linguist studying the Awá language who became friends with Karapiru in 2001 said:

“Karapiru, in my view, represents the best that a human being can become, due to his friendliness and tranquility. Also, an example of how resilient we can be in the most extreme situations.”

"The eating of dog meat has long been a traditional practice in South Korea, but has increasingly become an international embarrassment.

The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has now raised the idea of banning doing so in the country - where an estimated 1 million dogs are believed to be eaten annually.

Consumption has already been declining as more people embrace the animals as companions rather than livestock - and during a weekly meeting with the prime minister, Kim Boo-kyum, earlier this week, the president said the ‘time has come’ for the practice to end.

Moon, who has several canines at the presidential compound, including one dog he rescued after taking office, made his latest remarks as he was briefed on a plan to improve the care system for abandoned pets.

South Korea’s animal protection law is intended mainly to prevent the cruel slaughter of dogs and cats but does not ban consumption itself.

"Bitcoin to buy your weekly groceries?

That's the way things are heading in El Salvador after it became the first country in the world to vote to officially classify the cryptocurrency as legal tender.

This means that every business now must accept Bitcoin in exchange for goods or services, unless it can't provide the technology needed for the transaction.

Bitcoin - a digital currency - is essentially a computer file which is stored in a digital wallet app. Every transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain.

President Nayib Bukele said the government had made history, and that the move would make it easier for Salvadoreans living abroad to send money home.

""It will bring financial inclusion, investment, tourism, innovation and economic development for our country,"" Bukele said. He has previously said the move will open up financial services to the 70% of Salvadoreans who do not have bank accounts.

El Salvador's economy relies heavily on money sent home from abroad, which make up around 20% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), with over £2.8bn sent back to the central American nation each year.

"As the UK prepares to open its borders to Ukrainian refugees, and with over 89,000 Britons offering to house them in the newly-announced Homes for Ukraine scheme, some have claimed that this is the continuation of a ""noble tradition"" in the UK of welcoming refugees.

Journalist Simon Heffer said on BBC Radio 4: ""We have a noble tradition of looking after refugees. I think back to the kindertransport.""

Senior Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland posted a widely-shared thread on Twitter explaining the problem with citing the 1938-39 kindertransport as proof of Britain's history of opening its doors to refugees in need.

"Canada will have its first ever Indigenous governor general after prime minister Justin Trudeau appointed Inuk leader Mary Simon to the post.

The former ambassador, journalist and longtime advocate of Inuit rights will represent Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.

While the role is largely ceremonial, performing functions such as swearing in governments and formally signing legislation, the governor general is also the commander-in-chief of the military and can summon, prorogue or dissolve parliament.

Describing the move as a “historic” step, Trudeau announced Simon’s appointment on Tuesday almost six months after his previous selection resigned following allegations of bullying.

“I am honoured, humbled and ready to be Canada’s first Indigenous Governor General,” Simon said, also giving remarks in Inuktitut, her first language. “I can confidently say that my appointment is a historic and inspirational moment for Canada and an important step forward on the long path towards reconciliation.”

Her appointment comes as the country reckons with the discovery of more than 1,000 unmarked graves at the site of former church-run schools for Indigenous children.

In her remarks on Tuesday, Simon spoke of the need for Canada to “fully recognize, memorialize and come to terms with the atrocities of our collective past” as more is learned about the legacy of residential schools.

"Does this surprise you? The controversial ruler of Dubai is one of the UK's largest landowners, according to a Guardian analysis.

We found that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum and his close family have acquired a land and property empire in Britain that appears to exceed 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres). That area is about half as big as New York City. 

The huge property portfolio ranges from mansions, stables and training gallops across Newmarket, to white stucco houses in some of London’s most exclusive addresses and extensive moorland in the Scottish Highlands.

The Guardian has mapped these expansive private holdings linked to Sheikh Mohammed, who is vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, using Land Registry records and company filings.

The exact scale of his British landholding is not known because most of the properties connected to him are owned via offshore companies in the tax havens of Guernsey and Jersey.

A lawyer for Sheikh Mohammed declined to confirm any details of the properties or companies that own them, saying his financial affairs are private and confidential.

"Could this be the significant step in the long quest to one day use animal organs for life-saving transplants?

In a major scientific advance, surgeons at a New York hospital have attached a pig’s kidney to a human and watched it begin to work - it filtered waste and produced urine – and for the first time ever did not trigger a rejection.

The researchers kept a deceased woman’s body going on a ventilator after her family agreed to the experiment, feeling that ""there was a possibility that some good could come from this gift.""

Pigs have been the most recent research focus to address the organ shortage, but a sugar in their cells, which is foreign to the human body, causes immediate organ rejection.

The kidney for this experiment came from a gene-edited animal, engineered to eliminate that sugar and avoid an immune system attack.

Several biotech companies are in the running to develop suitable pig organs for transplant to help ease the human organ shortage.

More than 90,000 people in the US are in line for a kidney transplant. Every day, 12 people die while waiting.

But for many people raising pigs to be organ donors feels morally wrong, though it may grow more acceptable if concerns about animal welfare can be addressed, says Karen Maschke, a research scholar at the Hastings Center. “The other issue is going to be: Should we be doing this just because we can?” Maschke said.

"Deb Haaland has been confirmed as the secretary of the interior, making her the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history.

The 60-year-old from New Mexico will be responsible for the country’s land, seas and natural resources, as well as overseeing tribal affairs.

Haaland is a member of the Laguna Pueblo, one of 574 sovereign tribal nations located across 35 states. She is the most senior Indigenous American in the US government since the Republican Charles Curtis, a member of the Kaw nation situated in what is now Kansas, who served as vice-president to Herbert Hoover between 1929 and 1933.

She will lead about 70,000 staff who oversee one-fifth of all the land in the US and 1.7bn acres of coastlines, as well as managing national parks, wildlife refuges and natural resources such as gas, oil and water.

"This year’s Women’s World Cup promises to be the most anticipated in history - but with less than a month to go there have already been a number of issues off the pitch that the women’s teams have come up against.

@guardian_sport ‘s Suzanne Wrack explains that the tournament has *already* been making headlines before it kicks off in Australia and New Zealand on 20 July.

“There are already a lot of issues off the field that are going to be hugely influential on this tournament, there have been big disputes behind the scenes and very publicly,” Wrack says.

Wrack explains that these issues impact the ability of women’s teams to perform at, or even take part in, the tournament.

She says: “These disputes undermine the ability of teams and they speak to the wider commitment of Federation’s to their women’s teams and women’s football in general.”

In this video, @suzywrack explains three of the biggest disputes currently happening before the tournament - and why they are happening in the first place.

"From @guardian_sport: a number of German football clubs lit up their stadiums with rainbow colours during the Euro 2020 clash between Germany and Hungary to ""fill the void"" after UEFA rejected a request from the Munich mayor to illuminate the Allianz Arena.

Several Bundesliga clubs, including Wolfsburg, Hertha Berlin, Eintracht Frankfurt and Cologne, all went ahead with the display during the game last night in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, in particular in Hungary - where legislation was passed last week by its parliament banning school educational materials or TV shows for under-18s that the government considers to be promoting homosexuality or gender change.

The planned illumination of Allianz Arena for the match was requested by Munich city council and LGBTQ+ activists to “send a signal of support for inclusivity and diversity”.

But, Uefa said the rainbow lights would contravene its rules about political and religious neutrality so the protest at the stadium couldn’t go ahead. Days earlier it had ruled that the German team’s captain, Manuel Neuer, had not contravened those rules by wearing a rainbow armband.

Instead of the planned display, the mayor of Munich instead illuminated a wind turbine by the ground. Swipe to see a selection of the best pictures of the rainbow stadiums and more.

"Where do you buy your flowers?

Flowers are a thoughtful gift - whether it’s Mother's Day, Valentine's Day or just because.

But behind every bouquet, there’s a significant environmental cost.

In 2018, 360,000 tonnes of CO2 were produced from Valentine's Day flowers in the US.

That's roughly equivalent to driving 78,000 cars for a whole year.

Most florists in the UK and US, import their blooms from other countries, such as Colombia, Ecuador, Sri Lanka, Kenya and the Netherlands.

That means the majority of flowers you see whilst shopping will already have a big carbon footprint - but don’t lose hope.

There are many ways you can reduce the environmental damage of your bouquet.

"It's 160-square-foot (15 sq metre) - and just a few footsteps separate the bed and bathroom - in this unusual rental in Canada.

The Vancouver apartment, described as “ideal for a single individual looking to live downtown at an affordable rate, and who does not need much space” was listed on Craigslist this month.

The rental was removed after a few days, but not before being picked up by the website Vancouver is Awesome, which points out the apartment’s size is smaller than the city’s 250-square-foot (23 sq metre) definition of a micro dwelling.

Its layout means the toilet is in direct line of sight of the bed, without a door - though the shower is hidden behind the vanity unit. It also doesn't include a kitchen.

Vancouver is the seventh most expensive housing market in the world, according to a 2020 survey by commercial real estate firm CBRE, ahead of Los Angeles, Paris and New York.

The micro apartment’s rent of C$680 (US$550 or £396) a month is still more than half the city’s average.

"“When I found out I was HSP it truly changed and saved my life,"" tweeted comedian Miranda Hart.

The term Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) was coined in 1996 by psychologist Elaine Aron, who argued that sensitive brains are uniquely wired to process their environment at a deep level.

Her theory’s most striking claim is that physical and emotional sensitivity are one and the same. An intricate attention to body language heightens empathy; responsiveness to subtle physical cues creates rich sensations in HSPs, but can also overwhelm. Scratchy clothes, smells, background talk – unable to filter the noise, they soak up every drop.

We spoke with @jenngranneman, one of the writers of a new book on the subject, Sensitive: The Power of a Thoughtful Mind in an Overwhelming World.

The HSP hashtag has more than 498m views on TikTok, while Lorde, Nicole Kidman, Alanis Morissette, and Kanye West have publicly identified as such. HSPs make up about 30% of the population, so do you think you could you be one?

"From espresso to instant, coffee is part of the daily routine for so many of us ... Now research suggests the drink could be linked to a lower chance of developing or dying from chronic liver disease.

The new UK analysis is the latest to suggest drinking coffee could bring benefits, with previous work suggesting it may help stave off liver cancer, and reduce the risk of alcohol-related liver disease.

The study analysed data from 494,585 participants, aged between 40 to 69 when signing up - including 384,818 who were coffee drinkers at the outset compared with 109,767 who did not consume the beverage.

Looking at the liver health of the participants over a median period of almost 11 years, the researchers found 3,600 cases of chronic liver disease, with 301 deaths, and 1,839 cases of simple fatty liver disease.

The analysis revealed that after taking into account factors such as body mass index, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, those who drank any amount of coffee, and of any sort, had a 20% lower risk of developing chronic liver disease or fatty liver disease (taken together) than those who did not consume the brew.

The coffee drinkers also had a 49% lower risk of dying from chronic liver disease.

Chronic liver disease is a major health problem around the world. According to the British Liver Trust, liver disease is the third leading cause of premature death in the UK, with deaths having risen 400% since 1970.

Vanessa Hebditch, of the @british_liver_trust, said the research added to a growing body of evidence that coffee was good for liver health.

But she stressed the importance of not just drinking coffee to improve their liver health, but also ""cutting down on alcohol and keeping to a healthy weight by exercising and eating well.”

Does this make you want to drink coffee more?

"“With today’s action, [we] want to send two messages – that we don’t believe that rhino horns have any medicinal value and that we only believe in preserving the living rhinos.""

In aid of World Rhino Day, nearly 2,500 rare rhino horns that were confiscated by authorities were burned in public in Assam, India.

This is the first ceremony of its kind in northeastern India and is part of an anti-poaching drive.

Since the signing of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 1977, trade in rhino horn has been banned.

But there is still demand in China and Vietnam where it is sometimes promoted as a wonder ingredient in traditional medicine.

In South Africa alone, 769 rhinos were poached in 2018, and there have also been attempts to steal rhino horns from museums in Europe.

“A rhino horn has supreme value only when it is intact to the living rhino. These horns have no value,” Assam’s Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

Bokakhat, Assam is near the UNESCO-listed heritage site Kaziranga National Park, home to more than 2,000 one-horned rhinos – the world’s biggest population.

The collection of horns that were burned had been kept in storage by the government since 1969, some seized from poachers, and others removed from rhinos that died from natural causes.

The 'selfie cam' shows the male penguin diving and feeding in the Beagle Channel off Isla Martillo, in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina.

According to Oceana, Gentoo penguins, the third largest penguin species, are listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List.

Population declines on the sub-Antarctic islands have been blamed on increasing oil exploration, tourism and interactions with fisheries.

"What is a ""Peequal"", you ask? Swipe to the second slide and you'll see for yourself.

It's a new boat-shaped urinal where six women can pee at once in a circular configuration - and is being billed as the solution for all the women suffering through long waits for public toilets.

Designers and recent Bristol University graduates, Amber Probyn and Hazel McShane, came up with the idea while they were at a music festival.

According to their research, women queue up to 34 times longer than men because there are around 10 male urinals for every women’s public toilet.

The flatpack toilets are made from 100% recycled material and can be fully recycled - and it’s a “hands-free” arrangement that the designers call a pedestal. “It’s designed like a boat to minimise splashback,” says McShane, “and also to have a little place for your clothing in front.”

The Peequal is private from the waist down, so your top half is still visible above the partition.

Would you use the apparatus?

"‘I remember being soaking wet, lying under the tarp as ocean hit us and the rain poured down’

New Australian MP, @dai_le, was met with support after speaking emotionally on her experience as a refugee.

Wearing what appeared to be a traditional áo dài [Vietnamese dress] made out of the Australian flag, Le held back tears as she described fleeing Vietnam with her family in 1975, age seven, boarding wooden boats to the Philippines and then Hong Kong.

'I remember my sister and I hanging on to dear life, while my mother held my other sister tightly in her arms with her rosary beads praying... I remember how my face almost hit the ocean as our boat rocked so hard from the storm.'

She also described living for ‘years’ in refugee camps before being accepted to resettle in Australia.

Le went on to speak of her feelings of ‘gratitude and freedom’ at coming to live in the country.

'This migration story belongs to all of us. It’s our story, and we can all be proud to share it.'

Le, who represents the culturally diverse but low income area of Fowler, went on to criticise that her western Sydney community was subjected to more harsh conditions by the state government than wealthier areas in the city’s eastern suburbs during the 2021 lockdowns.

She said her community were 'the forgotten people, and yet we are the backbone of Australia.'

Her speech was greeted with supporters in Parliament House’s public galleries clapping, shouting and chanting her name.

""Thank you for a beautiful email showing a way of how to graciously give your life away. You did answer your own question. I will store your lesson away for myself for sure. I love your idea of books, a sort of manual, notes and birthday cards beyond the grave. If you carry out these ideas of yours, I would see the result as your art, your legacy of love that you must urgently make. I love it, I really hope you do it.

""I’m a bit cross with your therapist for what sounds like his dismissive misogyny, but we all have blind spots and he has been helpful in other ways. No therapist is ever perfect.

""The emotional work of the home can be invisible if you are not the one doing it, so not only will your manual be a beautiful gesture, I’m sure it will be a useful practical guide as well. 

""When my mother died, my father rang me because he didn’t know what brand of loo roll she used to buy. A micromanagement manual would’ve helped him, though of course it was only an excuse to ring (tell your husband he doesn’t need excuses to ring anyone). 

""Your death will be awful for your husband, but a beautiful funeral will make it easier to bear, so will having familiar loo roll, or whatever else you need to tell him. Such apparently little things don’t feel so little when you are grieving. “Being controlling” is not always a bad thing.""

Volunteers from the Kyiv Animal Rescue Group – founded in 2014 with the aim of rescuing animals during emergencies – navigated inundated towns, Russian shells and dangerous conditions to travel to the region and save the animals.

"107 years and 300 days old makes sisters Umeno Sumiyama and Koume Kodama the oldest ever identical twins the world has seen.

They were born on November 5, 1913 on Shodo Island in Japan, and were the third and fourth siblings of a family with 11 children.

According to the Guinness World Records, the pair were separated as children and rarely met up until they reached 70.

Living about 190 miles apart, they saw one another mostly at weddings and funerals. But when they turned 70, they reconnected and started making Buddhist pilgrimages together.

Previous record holders Kin and Gin, also from Japan, had held the title of oldest identical twins at 107 years and 175 days since Kin's death in January 2000. Gin died the following year, aged 108.

Sumiyama and Kodama are now living in separate care homes, and their families said the twins are sociable and positive, and that they often joked about surpassing the age of Kin Narita and Gin Kanie.

Because of Covid measures, their world record certificates were mailed to their nursing homes, and Sumiyama reportedly was in tears when she received hers, while Kodama's memory has faded and she couldn't fully understand the significance of it.

Japan has one of the highest life expectancy in the world of 84.67 years. The oldest living person on record was 118-year-old Japanese woman Kane Tanaka.

"Is Ozempic really a miracle drug, or the latest sign of how unwell our society’s relationship to size and weight is?

In a new personal essay, Rachel Pick looks at the rise of Ozempic and how quickly it has erased the modest gains of the body positivity movement (which was by no means perfect itself).

“When you go to such absurd lengths just to winnow yourself down a little, you are actively trying to put as much distance between yourself and fat people as you possibly can,” Pick writes. “It tells us that a part of you is disgusted by us, that a part of you has contempt for the way we are and the way we look.”

"What do you think of companies like Nike and Bumble giving staff a week off to 'destress'?

Because of the pressures of the pandemic, Nike has given its head office employees in the US a week off.

The sportswear and trainers brand said workers at its headquarters in Oregon would be “powering down” until Friday, with senior leaders encouraging staff to ignore all work responsibilities to aid their mental health.

“Take the time to unwind, destress and spend time with your loved ones. Do not work,” the Nike senior manager of global marketing science, Matt Marrazzo, said in an open message to staff posted on LinkedIn.

He acknowledged that “this past year has been rough”, adding that staff should recognise that “we’re all human” and living through a traumatic event.

It puts Nike among a growing number of businesses offering extra time off, or concessions around working responsibilities, to combat the burnout caused by home working and constant video calls that have blurred the line between personal and professional lives.

Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of the dating app Bumble, gave her 700 employees an extra week of paid leave to destress and switch off in June.

"Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown, the unstoppable running back who retired at the peak of his brilliant career to become an actor as well as a prominent civil rights advocate during the 1960s, has died. He was 87.

A spokeswoman for Brown’s family said he passed away peacefully in his Los Angeles home on Thursday night with his wife, Monique, by his side.

“To the world, he was an activist, actor, and football star,” Monique Brown wrote in an Instagram post. “To our family, he was a loving husband, father, and grandfather. Our hearts are broken.”

An unstoppable runner with power, speed and endurance, Brown’s arrival sparked the game’s burgeoning popularity on television. When he finished playing, Brown became a prominent leader in the Black power movement during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s. In later years, he worked to curb gang violence in LA and founded Amer-I-Can, a program to help disadvantaged inner-city youth and ex-convicts.

"Exclusive: Nick Markham, a Conservative health minister who was given a peerage by Liz Truss, has a substantial financial stake in a private health screening and Covid testing firm, the Guardian can reveal.

Markham, a businessman who was appointed to the health department, owns about 30% of Cignpost Investments and has done so throughout his first four months in the job, raising questions about the potential for a conflict of interest.

The company was set up during the pandemic to provide Covid testing and health screening services to the private sector.

Markham’s biography for the Department for Health website makes no mention of his private health sector interest, despite describing his previous private sector jobs at ITV and TopUp TV and as the founder of a charity.

He was made a health minister in September and declared the Cignpost investment on his register of interests in the House of Lords.

The Department of Health and Social Care had no comment when asked what was being done to mitigate the risks of a conflict of interest.

However, it is understood that Markham has told the department that he is now in the process of divesting his shareholding. He resigned as a director when he became a minister in September.

Angela Rayner, Labour deputy leader and shadow chancellor of the duchy
of Lancaster said: ""Conservative cronies have been rewarded with peerages and plum ministerial jobs while maintaining lucrative interests. There is a rotten stench about the revolving door the Tories have left wide open.""

"Has kit ever put you off playing a sport?

Around 85% of adolescent girls don’t get enough exercise, according to a 2022 study by the World Health Organization – and clothing is the ""most underrated cause"" of that.

England hockey player Tess Howard found through recent research that many teenage girls are feeling ""sexualised"" by the sports uniform that they are forced to wear - causing alarming numbers to drop out.

But there is growing movement away from white shorts in women’s sport. England’s Lionesses have changed out of white shorts and started playing in navy - and Ireland women's rugby union team have done the same. In November, Wimbledon also announced it was to drop the tournament’s strict all-white dress code and allow female players to wear dark undershorts, but many sports haven't yet followed suit.

Former England rugby union captain Catherine Spencer, who won 63 caps for her country and is now a commentator, says she almost dropped out of sports entirely because of 'kit anxiety.'

"What do you think of the world's tallest sandcastle?

It has been completed in Denmark, towering more than 20 metres high and is made of nearly 5,000 tonnes of sand.

Standing 21.16 metres in height (69.4 feet), the castle is more than 3 metres taller than one built in Germany in 2019, which previously held the title, according to Guinness World Records.

It took 4,860 tonnes of sand make up the intricately decorated structure, which is reminiscent of a pyramid, in the small seaside town of Blokhus.

That's half the weight of the Eiffel Tower!

Its Dutch creator, Wilfred Stijger, was assisted by 30 of the world’s best sand sculptors. He said he wanted the castle to represent the power the coronavirus has had over the world since the beginning of the pandemic. On top of the sandcastle is a model of the virus wearing a crown.

“It’s ruling our lives everywhere,” Stijger said. “It tells you what to do ... It tells you to stay away from your family and not go to nice places. Don’t do activities, stay home.”

To make it stick together well, the sand contains approximately 10% clay and a layer of glue was applied after it was completed so that it could stand up to autumn and winter weather.

The castle is expected to stand until heavy frost sets in early next year.

Its ruling our lives everywhere Stijger said It tells you what to do  It tells you to stay away from your family and not go to nice places Dont do activities stay home

To make it stick together well the sand contains approximately 10 clay and a layer of glue was applied after it was completed so that it could stand up to autumn and winter weather

"Would you live in an eco-town?

If you are wondering what a climate-conscious future looks like, the small town of Skellefteå in the far north of Sweden has some of the answers.

The wooden wonder might seem like a novelty one-off.

But the architects are keen to emphasise that the same process could be replicated anywhere, many hundreds of miles from a forest.

“We are currently studying how far we could transport this building without undoing the carbon saving,” says White Arkitekter’s Robert Schmitz.

“We think it could probably go twice around the world and still be carbon neutral.”

"""It is unacceptable that women cannot protect themselves ... because they cannot afford it.""

France's health minister has announced that women under the age of 25 will be offered free contraception from next year.

Olivier Véran said they would not not be charged for medical appointments, tests, or other medical procedures related to birth control.

Explaining the move, Véran said that studies had shown this was the age that many women were dropping contraception, not because they wanted to have children but “because it is expensive”.

Contraception has been free in France for those aged between 15 and 18 since 2013 and for the under-15s since August 2020. This has led to a drop in the number of abortions.

For women over 25, about 65% of the cost of contraception is reimbursed.

The measure, which covers the pill, IUD devices and contraceptive implants, is expected to cost France’s health system, the Assurance Maladie, about €21m a year.

"Who owns Australia?

The true answer is First Nations peoples, whose ownership stems back 60,000 years. The legal answer is more complex.

Six months ago @GuardianAustralia set out to learn who owns the outback. The data we received was unwieldy, incomplete, inconsistent and often came with a hefty price tag.

The concept of land ownership in Australia is complicated. There are freehold titles, as well as exclusive and non-exclusive native titles. They all relate to the rights of the people who own the land.

The maps above show changes in Indigenous-held land over the years.

Since 1965, Indigenous 'ownership' has returned to parts of the country - after two centuries of violent dispossession through European colonisation.

For mapping purposes, we've defined Indigenous tenure as exclusive-possession native title and freehold, as they give the right to exclude others from the land.

Using this definition, Indigenous tenure makes up about 26% of Australia's landmass.

But for Indigenous leaders like Keven Smith, a Torres Strait man and chief executive of Queensland South Native Title Services, the connection of traditional owners to a place is not defined by whether they are able to be granted native title.

“If you ask the question of who owns Australia, I would say that First Nations people own this country,” Smith says. “Even though there’s limited application of native title over the four corners of this nation, cultural heritage is tenure-blind.”

"This week began with an astonishing political comeback in Brazil.

Brazil’s leftist former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – known as Lula – narrowly defeated far right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro by two percentage points.

By choosing Lula, Brazil is abandoning Bolsonaro’s far-right vision for the country, which has been characterised over the past three years by attacks on democratic institutions, the media, the left and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Instead, the Brazilian electorate chose Lula and a platform that centred around social justice, environmental protection, defending democracy and reunifying the country.

Four more years of Bolsonaro would have had devastating environmental consequences, not just for Brazil but for the whole world. Two billion trees have been burned or cut down during his presidency – an area the size of greater London was lost in the first six months of 2022 alone.

So is there reason to be hopeful now?

Our Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips thinks there definitely is. And analysis conducted for Carbon Brief indicates that Lula’s victory could cut Amazon deforestation by 89% over the next decade.

"These are the best-preserved human remains ever discovered in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii.

The remains of Marcus Venerius Secundio were found in a tomb at the necropolis of Porta Sarno. The tomb is believed to date back to the decades before Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79.

The discovery even includes Secundio’s white hair and a partially visible ear. Initial tests show he died at about the age of 60.

Secundio was a slave and the custodian of ancient Pompeii’s Temple of Venus. After being freed from slavery, he rose though the social ranks and joined the Augustales, a college of priests who were in charge of a form of emperor worship.

An inscription dedicated to Secundio on a marble slab at the top of the tomb makes references to theatre performances in Pompeii that were conducted in Greek.

The fact that he was buried in a tomb proves he succeeded in achieving a good social and economic position.

Pompeii was very well preserved underneath the blanket of ash from the eruption, and was discovered, frozen in time, in the 1700s. Preserved remains of people sheltering from the eruption were found, as well as bakeries with loaves still in the ovens.

"Have you been able to see the stars better? 

In Britain, the number of stars visible in the skies have increased in this year’s annual count, indicating a lessening of light pollution in lockdown.

CPRE, the countryside charity, said 51% of people taking part in its citizen science count in February 2021 noted 10 or fewer stars in the Orion constellation, which indicates severe light pollution.

During the same period in 2020, before the first lockdown, 61% of counts registered 10 or fewer stars.

The results, recorded on an interactive map, are published during International Dark Sky Week, which aims to raise awareness of the impact of light pollution. 

Light pollution has an effect on the decline of insects, especially moths, while also changing the behaviour of many other animal species.

That was until the Orthodox school she taught at dismissed her after parents found out she is transgender, creating a fierce debate within the traditionally conservative community.

Since then, she has been fighting to return to her life as a religious transgender woman – and to further the acceptance of other transgender people within Orthodox Judaism.

"Morgan Howell is giving classic rock'n'roll singles new dimensions - by creating giant 3D paintings of them complete with crinkled sleeves.

The painter hopes they will make people start reminiscing about a certain song and the role it has played in their life.

Howell's work covers records released between 1953 and 1984, before picture sleeves largely replaced the company sleeves - which he says gave every artist the same chance; ""It was a level playing field. David Bowie and some guy that you’ve never heard of were stuck in the same sleeve. There were no fancy pictures or gimmicks – just the record bag.""

Before deciding on a song to cover, Howell often buys multiple copies of a seven-inch single from around the world - researching the song on different labels or from various countries. He says a sticker or price label is always a bonus, because it helps to tell a story.

""The music itself will always exist, of course, but that first moment it entered the world and how it was packaged does not. The 45s are tucked away in collections and in dusty boxes. No one sees them or thinks about what they represent.""

Did any of these pictures make you reminisce?

"Which face do you feel the strongest emotional response to?

Whether in a cloud, the front of a car, or even a toasted sandwich, seeing faces in inanimate objects is a common experience.

According to new research by the University of Sydney, our brains detect and respond emotionally to these illusory faces the same way they do to real human faces.

Once considered a symptom of psychosis, seeing faces in everyday objects arises from an error in visual perception.

Lead researcher Prof David Alais said human brains are evolutionarily hardwired to recognise faces, with highly specialised brain regions for facial detection and processing.

“We are such a sophisticated social species and face recognition is very important,” Alais said. “You need to recognise who it is, is it family, is it a friend or foe, what are their intentions and emotions?

“Faces are detected incredibly fast. The brain seems to do this… using a kind of template-matching procedure, so if it sees an object that appears to have two eyes above a nose above a mouth, then it goes, ‘Oh I’m seeing a face.’

“It’s a bit fast and loose and sometimes it makes mistakes, so something that resembles a face will often trigger this template match.”

In the research, when people were shown a jumble of real human faces and faces in inanimate objects, the latter were processed in the same way we would normally process emotion in a real face.

"""I, sovereign Lidia Thorpe, do solemnly and sincerely affirm and declare that I will be faithful and I bear true allegiance to the colonising Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the second.""

Indigenous senator Lidia Thorpe was forced to redo her oath of allegiance for Australian parliamentarians.

With one fist raised, senatorthorpe referred to the Queen as a ""coloniser"" when being sworn in to Australia’s parliament on Monday.

The Greens senator was chided by the Labor Senate president, Sue Lines, who instructed her to redo her oath again by lines.

Thorpe’s statement was also met by an uproar on the Senate floor. One voice can be heard to say “You’re not a senator if you don’t do it properly,” while another added ""None of us like it.”

Thorpe said she stood for parliament “to question the illegitimate occupation of the colonial system in this country” in an interview with Australian talk show The Project last month.

In June, Prime minister Anthony Albanese appointed the country’s first minister tasked with overseeing Australia’s transition to a republic.

"In an effort to motivate people to adopt abandoned dogs, Romania's football federation has teamed up with local shelters so that for the whole season, at every match in the first division, the players will enter the field with stray dogs in their arms.

The aim of the 'fill the void in your life' initiative is to get people who are at the stadium or are watching the game at home to give the animals new homes. Dinamo Bucharest's players, pictured above, took part last weekend.

The plan is for the dogs to have name tags attached to them, as well as a scarf, so that it's easier for a viewer to recognise them when they get in touch about a possible adoption.

What do you think of the campaign?

"How do these images make you feel?

These images are all taken by underwater photographers who are determined to show us the ocean's silent struggle.

Whether it's a moray eel tangled in a 'ghost' fishing line, or lizardfish attempting to eat a cigarette end, the Ocean photography awards are a window into how human behaviour is affecting marine life.

Kerim Sabuncuoğlu won an award for his image of a moray eel that suffocated after becoming entangled in a fishing line. He witnessed the result of what’s known as ghost fishing. “When a fisherman leaves his equipment under the water, like a fishing net or line, it keeps on killing fish for many years to come,” he explains. “If I had left this moray eel, some other fish would have eaten the hook, and died as well.”

It’s a worldwide problem. Ghost fishing gear accounts for around an estimated 10% of all marine litter.

The National Geographic photographer and conservationist Cristina Mittermaier was among the judges who picked Sabuncuoğlu as the ocean conservation photographer of the year. “It’s a fantastic image,” she says.

“Underwater wildlife communicate in a very different way to terrestrial wildlife, and they don’t have the same facial expressions that an animal like a grizzly bear might have. Therefore, making images that create an emotional connection with humans, when you’re photographing fish, is really hard. In this image, the photographer was able to capture a dramatic moment, and the eel actually has a facial expression that conveys emotion. It caught me as soon as I saw it.”

"'We wish that was real life’

After the USA’s win against Iran, a mutual feeling of respect and fellowship emerged yesterday.

Sean Ingle, The Guardian's chief sports reporter, is in Tokyo right now - here's a snippet of his analysis from last night's basketball match:

""The players and coaches gave their political leaders a lesson in harmony, decency and class in Tokyo.⁣
⁣
Seeing players from these teams bond during and after their match was enough to melt the heart of even the iciest cynic.⁣
⁣
When US coach Gregg Popovich was asked about the significance of his team and Iran sharing a court together, he hit the nail on the head. “I think people from different countries get along better than their governments,” he said. “People appreciate each other, no matter what country you are talking about. I really believe that. And this is a time where sport transcends all that petty crap you get from governments.”⁣
⁣
Whether this will make any difference to wider US-Iran relations is an entirely different story. But it might at least make leaders stop to reflect.""

"Do you think this is fair?

As Singapore grapples with a surge in cases, the government has announced it will no longer pay the Covid-19 medical bills for people “unvaccinated by choice”.

The full Covid medical costs for all Singaporeans is currently covered, as well as permanent residents and long-term visa holders, unless they test positive soon after returning home from overseas.

However from 8 December, the government said it will start charging unvaccinated Covid patients who “make up a sizeable majority of those who require intensive in-patient care and disproportionately contribute to the strain on our healthcare resources”.

Covid-related medical bills will still be paid for people who aren’t eligible for a vaccine. The government said it will also foot the bill for individuals who are partially vaccinated until 31 December, giving them time to get a second dose.

Singapore has among the highest coverage rates in the world, with 85% of the eligible population fully vaccinated. Yet the city state is struggling with rising Covid infections and last month warned its healthcare system was at risk of being “overwhelmed” by surging cases.

It came a day after the country expanded quarantine-free travel as part of a shift in its approach to dealing with the pandemic.

The prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, previously said the global business hub could not remain closed indefinitely, and Singapore has moved from a zero-tolerance strategy with lockdowns and closed borders to living with Covid-19.

On 8 November, the country reported 2,470 new cases and 14 deaths. The ministry of heath said 67 Covid cases were critically ill in intensive care.

"Ten days ago, people stood on a beach on the south coast of England and tried to prevent a lifeboat crew from going into the sea to rescue a group of refugees in a flimsy dinghy.

According to witnesses, who captured the footage above, they were shouting at crews from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (@rnli) charity: “Don’t bring any more of those, we’re full up, that’s why we stopped our donations.”

Conversely, a group from the same town calling itself Hastings Supports Refugees (@hsrefugees) has set up what is thought to be the first emergency response team run by volunteers to welcome the bedraggled, traumatised newcomers and provide them with hot food and drinks, dry clothes and a warm welcome as soon as they come ashore.

The two approaches underline tensions at the heart of the East Sussex coastal town affected by the rise in small boat arrivals which culminated in 27 people drowning as they attempted to cross the Channel last week.

"What's the factorial of 100?

That would be the multiplication of 100 by every whole number less than it. In other words, 100 x 99 x 98 x 97 x 96 x …. x 3 x 2 x 1.

If you can figure out the answer, you could be considered smarter than Google ... or at least that's what Alex Bellos, who has been setting a puzzle for the Guardian every two weeks since 2015, found out in the video above.

Google Assistant's answer was incorrect as it is rounded up.

The answer is a big number, but how many zeroes does the factorial of 100 really have at the end of it?

All that is required to solve this puzzle is knowledge of elementary arithmetic. Such as the fact that, if a number has a 0 at the end, it means this number is divisible by 10.

"Wild cockatoos have been observed using three types of tools as “cutlery” to extract seeds from tropical fruit.

Researchers made the discovery while studying Goffin’s cockatoos on the Tanimbar Islands, a remote archipelago in Indonesia.

The team noticed the behaviour in two wild cockatoos, who crafted tools from tree branches and used them to extract seed matter from sea mangoes, a tropical fruit.

They found that the cockatoos showed a high level of dexterity in manufacturing and using the cutlery.

After observing the behaviour repeatedly and collecting some of the cutlery used by the birds, the team were able to classify the tools into three types.

The birds used sturdy, thick twigs to wedge open a fruit and allow access to its inner portion, fine tools to pierce the layer surrounding a seed like a knife, and medium-sized tools to spoon out the inner seed matter.

"The world's largest active volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa, has begun erupting for the first time since 1984, ending its longest quiet period in recorded history.

The eruption wasn’t immediately endangering towns, but the US Geological Survey warned the roughly 200,000 people on the Big Island that an eruption “can be very dynamic, and the location and advance of lava flows can change rapidly”. Officials have told residents to be prepared to evacuate if lava flows started heading toward populated areas.

"Do you remember what you were doing in May 2020?

Boris Johnson has been accused of an “utterly outrageous” breach of lockdown rules again - as a leaked email showed one of his top officials invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party during the first lockdown. The police are now investigating.

The British prime minister is believed to have attended the No 10 garden party on 20 May 2020 along with Carrie Johnson, then his fiancee, after it was advertised by his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds.

“Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” the email seen by ITV News said.

It invited just over 100 employees to the gathering at a time when social mixing was banned except with one other person from another household outdoors in a public place.

The party came five days after a 15 May 2020 “wine and pizza” party in Downing Street in the garden and inside No 10, reported by the Guardian in December, with staff drinking late into the evening.

Johnson will now come under huge pressure to explain his own role in the gathering, whether he played any part in the invitation given the phrase “we thought it would be nice” and why his office did not listen to alleged warnings from his former aide, Dominic Cummings, that it appeared to be against the rules. Cummings revealed the existence of the 20 May party in a blog on Friday.

Johnson’s spokesperson declined to comment in light of a continuing inquiry into potential breaches of lockdown in Downing Street. No 10 did not deny this weekend that Johnson and his wife, Carrie, whom he married in May 2021, attended the event.

"""It was ludicrous""

In London, Paul Powlesland, a barrister and climate activist who had held up a blank piece of paper near parliament, said he had been threatened with arrest by a police officer if he added the words 'Not my King' to his sign.

Civil liberties campaigners and others have expressed alarm about the response of police to anti-monarchy protesters after a number of incidents, one of which included the arrest and subsequent de-arrest of Symon Hill for shouting, 'Who elected him?' when the proclamation of King Charles III was read out in Oxford.

Powlesland told the Guardian on Monday night that he had had quite a long discussion with the police who had stopped him, who were from Norfolk’s force. “Normally, you can get into trouble for shouting, but if you have something written that is super-factual and which is not abusive, then you would normally think that you are protected. It’s pure free speech.""

“I think the idea that he could arrest me and that there could be a conviction under the Public Order Act was ludicrous, but interventions like that are having a chilling effect,” Powlesland added.

The Metropolitan police on Monday night appeared to acknowledge the reaction to Powlesland’s tweets after they had gone viral, issuing a statement saying it was was aware of video showing an officer speaking to a member of the public at the Palace of Westminster.

“The public absolutely have a right to protest and we have been making this clear to all officers involved in the extraordinary policing operation currently in place and we will continue to do so,” said the deputy assistant commissioner, Stuart Cundy.

"The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have banned their social media teams from posting pictures of athletes taking the knee at these Olympic Games, the Guardian can reveal.

An insider said the message was delivered from on high on Tuesday evening Tokyo time, with a specific reference to Team GB’s women’s first football match against Chile, just hours before it kicked off in Sapporo on Wednesday.

The image of both teams taking the knee beforehand, in a protest against racism and online hate, was seen on live TV and the gesture was then followed by United States and Sweden players as well as those from New Zealand. The players of Team Australia chose to stand.

None of these powerful pictures were posted on the official Tokyo 2020 live blog, or its Facebook and Twitter pages, or its Instagram site, which has more than half a million followers. They were also not seen on any of the IOC’s social channels.

Speaking after the match against Chile, Steph Houghton, one of Team GB’s three captains, said the decision to take a knee was supported by the entire squad. “As players in Great Britain we’ve been taking the knee in club and international matches and we felt strongly as a group that we wanted to show support for those affected by discrimination and equality,” she added.

“It was a proud moment because the Chile players took the knee too to show how united we are as sport.”

"Are you a fan of any of these books?

From red scare to read scare – these are just some of the books that Republicans are trying to ban in schools across America.

All of the above books appear on a list of 850 titles compiled by the Texan Republican and state lawmaker Matt Krause, who is investigating which schools hold them.

His campaign follows the state’s new anti-Critical Race Theory bill, which bans teaching any materials that could cause students “discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual’s race or sex.”

His list might only be circulating in Texas, but many of the books on his list have already been subject to challenges across the US, or banned in certain school districts.

In Pennsylvania, one school board has banned a long list of books, almost entirely titles by, or about, people of color. This includes Ijeoma Oluo's ""So You Want to Talk about Race"" (slide two) and Ibram X Kendi's ""How to be Antiracist"" (slide three).

Meanwhile, Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me (slide two) has been the subject of numerous challenges across the US, and was reportedly banned by an Ohio school board in 2020.

Groups purporting to be “grassroots” efforts have frequently led the charge, petitioning school boards or elected officials to remove certain books. Though some of these organizations present themselves as a local effort that sprang up around groups of parents united behind a cause, many of the groups involved in banning books are in fact linked, and backed by influential conservative donors.

Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom, said the number of attempts to ban books had soared through 2021.

“What’s unique is it appears to be an organized effort by a number of advocacy groups to activate members in local chapters to challenge books in school libraries and public libraries in the United States,” she said.

"Clubbing has returned to England.

At the start of the week, the government removed all Covid regulations – and in their place replaced them with “guidelines” putting all responsibility on businesses and individuals to ensure their own protection.

But infections are rising, particularly among still-unvaccinated younger people - who are more likely to be clubbers or working in the hospitality sector.

So what can we do to protect ourselves and others?

If you swipe across you can see the extent to which it's been causing problems in Turkey.

Parts of the country has been struck by huge amounts of this sea snot, which is on the rise due to global heating.

The environment minister has announced a plan to tackle sea snot, but while the clean up takes place it's threatening coral and fishing industries.

The gloopy, mucus-like substance had not been recorded in Turkish waters before 2007 and is created as a result of prolonged warm temperatures, calm weather and in areas with abundant nutrients in the water.

"Do you agree?

The Duke of Cambridge has criticised the space race - and space tourism - saying the world’s greatest minds need to focus on trying to fix our planet instead.

Prince William’s comments, in an interview with Newscast on BBC Sounds, were aired the day after actor William Shatner made history by becoming the oldest person in space. The 90-year-old, known for his role in Star Trek, lifted off from the Texas desert on Wednesday in a rocket built by the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s space travel company Blue Origin.

The duke, who was interviewed about the climate crisis ahead of his inaugural Earthshot prize awards and global Cop26 summit also expressed his concerns about a rise in climate anxiety in young people. He said it would be an “absolute disaster” if his eldest son, Prince George, was having to talk about the same issue in 30 years when it would be too late - and warned world leaders against “clever words but not enough action”.

William added that his viewpoint had changed since he had kids: “I want the things that I’ve enjoyed – the outdoor life, nature, the environment – I want that to be there for my children, and not just my children but everyone else’s children.

“If we’re not careful we’re robbing from our children’s future through what we do now. And I think that’s not fair.”

"Ivy Snitzer was Gwyneth Paltrow’s body double for the role of Rosemary in 2001’s Shallow Hal.

At the time, 20-year-old Snitzer was a Los Angeles-based acting student with aspirations to become an actor or comedian. “Mostly, I just wanted to be funny,” she says.

Snitzer has zero negative memories of shooting the movie. The cast and crew “treated me like I really mattered”, she says, “like they couldn’t make the movie without me”. Snitzer was made to “feel really comfortable” when her body was being filmed.

However, as she promoted the movie’s release with TV and magazine interviews, she soon realized that strangers took her moment in the spotlight as an open invitation to approach her on the street.

Many were angry that Snitzer had said, “It is not the worst thing in the world to be fat”; some claimed she was promoting obesity. 

One person found her address and sent her diet pills. There were love letters, too – someone mailed her a symphony they had composed especially for her.

“I got really scared,” she says. “I was like: maybe I’m done with the concept of fame, maybe I don’t want to be an actor. Maybe I’ll do something else.”

Less than two years after Shallow Hal was released, Snitzer says she was “technically starving to death”. In 2003, she had gastric band surgery, which reduced the size of her stomach and restricted what she could eat. But shortly after the procedure, the band slipped.

“I was so thin you could see my teeth through my face and my skin was all grey,” she says. “Humans shouldn’t have to experience how very bleak that particular time in my life was.”

However, 22 years after appearing in Shallow Hal, Snitzer is still coming to terms with its impact on her life.

"""I wanted to create something that you can’t ignore.""

Ella Daish, a British environmental activist, is stepping up her campaign against single-use plastics in period products by calling on the world’s bestselling manufacturer of tampons to make greener alternatives.

The founder of the #EndPeriodPlastic campaign is today going to the European headquarters of Tampax-maker Procter & Gamble in Geneva to present executives with a giant tampon applicator, made of 1,200 discarded Tampax applicators found littering British waterways, rivers and beaches.

After a call on social media, Daish asked people across the UK to send her plastic tampon applicators they found polluting their local environment. She was sent boxes filled to the brim with discarded plastic applicators, found in all parts of the UK from the River Clyde to the Isles of Scilly.

@elladaish said she had met more than 10 retailers and manufacturers since launching her campaign in 2018, but US multinational Procter & Gamble had been the least responsive. “I am just fed up ... despite being the global leader of these products they are not doing anything. They are falling behind and every other manufacturer and retailer I’ve met is moving in the right direction.”

A spokesperson for Procter & Gamble said: “We wholeheartedly agree with Ella that plastics do not belong on beaches and we’re working to address this in line with European waste infrastructure ..."" 

The company added that they made reusable period products, as well as tampons with cardboard applicators. “We know that periods are a highly personal topic and what’s right for some is not necessarily right for all. Our goal is to find a solution where people with periods don’t have to compromise quality, while also having the absolute least impact on the earth.”

In 2019, the EU passed a law banning single-use plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers and cotton buds, which came into effect in July 2021. The law didn't ban the use of plastics in tampons, pads and applicators, but requires companies to mark these products as containing plastic, with information about how to dispose of them correctly.

"""Human rights are non-negotiable""

Germany’s players placed hands over their mouths and wore rainbow stripes on their warm-up tops and boots in a show of defiance against Fifa before their World Cup match against Japan.

In a powerful statement published shortly after the game started, the German Football Association warned football’s governing body: “Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position ...
“It wasn’t about making a political statement – human rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted, but it still isn’t the case. That’s why this message is so important to us.”

Their message was reinforced by the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, who also wore a OneLove armband, which promotes tolerance, diversity and LGBTQ+ rights, as she sat next to Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino at the Khalifa International Stadium in Qatar.

Germany are one of seven nations, including England and Wales, who were banned by Fifa from wearing the armband on Sunday. The fear of sporting sanctions – including captains receiving a yellow card at kickoff – had led the teams to backtrack from their promise to wear the OneLove in their World Cup matches.

However Danish football federation chief executive, Jakob Jensen, has confirmed that those nations were now exploring legal options to overturn Fifa’s decision.

"Debbie Hewitt is to become the English Football Association's first ever chairwoman in its 157-year history.

Hewitt, who was awarded an MBE in 2011 for services to business and the public sector, said she was ""excited by the opportunity to play my part in shaping the future of something that means so much to so many"".

She was the unanimous choice of the FA's board to succeed Greg Clarke, who resigned after making racially offensive remarks in front of a parliamentary committee last November.

She will take charge of English football’s governing body at one of the most precarious financial moments in its history. The FA has projected estimated financial losses from Covid-19 to reach £300m by 2024 and has laid off 124 members of staff.

The consequences of the failed European Super League have also caused disruptions across the game and the government is conducting a review into the governance of football in England, which could lead to the introduction of an independent regulator.

"Donald Trump has announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, likely sparking another period of tumult in US politics and especially his own political party.

“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump said from ballroom of his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach on Tuesday night.

The long-expected announcement by a twice-impeached president who incited a deadly attack on Congress seems guaranteed to deepen a stark partisan divide that has fueled fears of increased political violence.

But it also comes as Trump’s standing in the Republican party has suddenly been put into question. Trump spoke at Mar-a-Lago a week after midterm elections in which his Republican party did not make expected gains, losing the Senate and seeming on course for only a narrow majority in the US House.

"The moving film is about Colette Marin-Catherine, as she visits, for the first time, the Nazi concentration camp where her brother was killed.

Colette, one of the last surviving members of the French Resistance, always refused to set foot in Germany but this changed when a young history student named Lucie entered her life. Together they travel to what remains of the forced labour camp near Nordhausen, Germany, in a journey of discovery that reopens old wounds and lessons of the past.

This documentary, released by The Guardian, and directed by Anthony Giacchino, has been nominated for an Academy Award.

"""This is NOT the answer"".

An increasing number of countries are banning travel to and from countries in Africa due to the Omicron Covid variant.

Despite the variant being found in Europe before South African detected and flagged it to the world, it is the African nations that have been closed off from countries like Canada, UK, US, Australia, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia, to name a few.

This has sparked a conversation online about how these bans are could be fuelled by racism, and how this situation was inevitable due to vaccine inequality across the world.

""Toughening up restrictions in the west in response to Omicron is a classic case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, because for months the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been warning rich developed countries that an end to the pandemic requires poor people as well as rich to be vaccinated.""

"In a rarely seen phenomenon in the monkey world, a nine-year-old female known as Yakei has become the boss of a 677-strong troop of Japanese macaques at a nature reserve on the island of Kyushu in Japan.

Yakei’s path to the top began in April when she beat up her own mother to become the alpha female of the troop at the Takasakiyama natural zoological garden in Oita city.

While that would have been the pinnacle for most female monkeys, Yakei decided to throw her 10kg weight around among the males. In late June, she challenged and roughed up Sanchu, the 31-year-old alpha male who had been leader of “troop B” at the reserve for five years.

Surprised wardens at Takasakiyama, where there has never been a female monkey boss in the reserve’s 70-year history, carried out a “peanut test” on 30 June, putting out nuts for the group and seeing who ate first. Sanchu backed away and gave Yakei first dibs on the treat, confirming her alpha status.

“Since then, Yakei has been climbing trees and shaking them, which is an expression of power and a very rare behaviour in females,” Satoshi Kimoto, a guide at Takasakiyama, told the Guardian.

Takasakiyama, established as a reserve for monkeys in 1952, is home to about 1,500 macaques, split between troop A and troop B. The monkeys live mainly in the forested mountain at the centre of the reserve, roaming freely and coming down to lower ground for food provided by wardens.

The wild population of Japanese macaque monkeys is estimated to be more than 100,000. They are known to sometimes be aggressive, and hikers, mountain climbers and visitors to the Takasakiyama reserve are advised not to maintain eye contact with them as it is interpreted as a challenge.

"Would you try an anti-anxiety patch?

They are stickers which claim to calm the person wearing them by transmit signals to the brain.

This might sound appealing, as over 300 million are living with anxiety disorder, according to the World Health Organisation, and a lot of these people feel let down by their countries mental health care system.

Including one of our feature writers Alaina Demopoulos, who decided to try NuCalm, one brand of anti-anxiety patches, for a couple of weeks after she saw Meghan Markle wearing one.

She wondered whether something that looked and felt just like a sticker could actually have a calming effect.

In the video, Demopoulos shares what the neuroscientists think of the anti-anxiety stickers and what her experiences trying it for two weeks.

"This remarkable photo shows the biggest rockfall in the UK in 60 years.

Starting on Tuesday, a ""substantial"" section of a cliff on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset collapsed onto a beach below and into the sea.

The rockfall happened just west of the seaside town of Weymouth, and Dorset council said more cliff was expected to be lost, with people being urged to stay away from the area.

About 300 metres of the cliff was affected when 4,000 tonnes came away in massive chunks, some the size of cars, falling towards the beach below.

Student geologist Jodie Brewin told the BBC: “It’s to do with re-weathering and erosion that basically falls hand in hand and shapes this coastline.”

Southern England has seen a lot of rock and cliff falls, and in February, the chalk cliffs that border much of Kent and Sussex experienced a rise in falls. There were warnings the coast could dramatically change by the summer.

"After a bumper wet season, huge flocks of budgerigars are on the move in the desert. A massive murmuration – the phenomenon of thousands of birds flocking together – has swarmed Australia's Northern Territory.

Photographer Steve Pearce has captured the natural phenomenon, saying ""The photos are always only pointing in one direction. There could have been 100,000 of them.""

After a tough couple of years due to drought and bushfires, some inland Australian bird species are now thriving after a buoyant wet season.

Pearce said this was the biggest murmuration he had ever seen.

“You hear one budgie, that first fella comes in, he flies past, then another one, then it’s like over a short time, maybe five minutes, they all just turn up and start arriving en masse ... There’s a critical mass that sweeps in.

""It’s spectacular.”

“The visual stuff it’s mesmerising, you can’t look away, it’s spectacular. It is a dynamic expression of nature,” he added.

A show this big is rare. The nomadic creatures need to drink water daily and as the smaller watering holes dry up they are forced to congregate together. They go where the rain goes – so it never lasts long.

"You may have been hearing the word 'blackfishing' more and more recently. The definition above is how journalist Wanna Thompson - who is credited with coining the term - described it to CNN.

'Blackfishing' rose to prominence in 2018 when Thompson said she noticed white celebrities and influencers 'cosplaying as black women'.

“It’s always been prevalent,” Thompson says. “Be it fashion, beauty or music. Black is cool, unless you’re actually black.”

The word has been appearing a lot in headlines at the moment in connection with former Little Mix band member Jesy Nelson. She has frequently faced accusations of blackfishing, altering her hair, lips and skin tone to appear racially ambiguous, and singing in a blaccent.

In response to the latest claims, during an Instagram Live with rapper Nicki Minaj, to promote their new single Boyz, Nelson said she never intended to cause offence and wanted to celebrate the music she loves and has grown up with.

Minaj also defended the former Little Mix star saying: ""Y'all gotta stop."" She added on Twitter: ""If you know someone has been suicidal from bullying in the past, why try to get a bunch of people to bully them again about something else?""

Nelson is not the first star to be called out for allegedly 'blackfishing', people like Kim Kardashian, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, and Bhad Bhabie have all faced accusations of pretending to be black or mixed-race.

“It’s about picking and choosing common black traits and characteristics for one’s benefit,” explains Johanna Yaovi, the founder of The Curl Talk Project, “while we continue to face discrimination on a day to day basis.

“As black women, we are constantly fighting for clear, authentic representation and diversity and then have to face individuals who do blackfishing, individuals who will therefore look ambiguous enough for brands to use them as emblems for diversity.""

She may soon be joined by Oregon's Tina Kotek, who at the time of writing is leading her race for governor.

In Vermont, the Democrat Becca Balint won her House race, making her the first woman and the first out gay politician to represent the state. This also means Vermont is the last of all 50 states to elect a woman to Congress.

"In helmet and bulletproof vest, Abir Moussi took her seat in Tunisia's parliament - prompting amusement, eye rolls and memes - but why?

The MP and lawyer made the attention-grabbing gesture after the speaker banned private security guards from all parties, some of whom have been accused of assault.

Moussi is a supporter of the autocratic former president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who was ousted in Tunisia’s 2011 uprising. She was sitting with a picture of Ali’s predecessor, Habib Bourguiba, which provoked laughter and resignation among Tunisians, who are wearied by the seemingly endless fighting between the parliament’s religious and secular blocs and increasingly concerned by rising cases of Covid-19 and mounting national debt.

Moussi, a senior member of the secular Free Destourian party, known by its French acronym PDL, defended the old regime in court after the revolution, which initially led to her being ostracised by her fellow party members and attacked in the street. But she has enjoyed an unlikely rise in popularity after a growing dissatisfaction with the democratic transition.

Tunisia has been plagued by sinking wages, growing joblessness and worsening public services. Several recent polls have confirmed that both PDL and Moussi’s own populist, conspiracy theory-laden platform are popular among voters.

Moussi’s personal rankings are second only to president Kais Saied, who secured an overwhelming majority in elections in 2019 after running as an independent on a socially conservative platform.",2021-05-05 15:04:15,"In helmet and bulletproof vest Abir Moussi took her seat in Tunisias parliament  prompting amusement eye rolls and memes  but why

"The Texas Republican congressman Louie Gohmert has asked a senior US government official if changing the moon’s orbit around the Earth, or the Earth’s orbit around the sun, might be a solution to tackle the climate crisis.

Bizarrely, the question was not posed to anyone from Nasa or even the Pentagon. Instead it was asked of a senior forestry service official during a House natural resources committee hearing on Tuesday.

Speaking with Jennifer Eberlien, associate deputy chief of the US Forest Service, Gohmert asked if it was possible to alter the orbits of the moon, or the Earth, as a way of combating climate change.

“I understand from what’s been testified to the Forest Service and the BLM [Bureau of Land Management], you want very much to work on the issue of climate change,” Gohmert said, adding that a past director of Nasa had once told him that orbits of the moon and the Earth were indeed changing.

“We know there’s been significant solar flare activity, and so … is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM can do to change the course of the moon’s orbit, or the Earth’s orbit around the sun?” Gohmert asked. “Obviously that would have profound effects on our climate.”

Eberlien said she would have to “follow up with you on that one, Mr Gohmert.”

Though he seemed to be entirely earnest, some observers have posited that Gohmert was seeking to express a belief that climate change was a phenomenon of natural changes in the orbits of celestial bodies, and so any other efforts to address it would be futile.""

"A sunfish estimated to weigh up to 2,000kg (4,410lb) has been found tangled in tuna fishing nets in the Mediterranean.

The gigantic animal was measured at 3.2 metres long and 2.9 metres wide, a record find for Ceuta, a Spanish autonomous city on the north coast of Africa. It was so heavy a big a crane was needed to winch it aboard a ship during rescue efforts - and it almost broke a 1,000kg scale.

North Korea has one of the world’s strictest quarantine regimes, despite the government’s denial that any cases have been detected in the country.

"The Sun has distanced itself from a key part of its own story about a prominent BBC presenter.

On Saturday the tabloid claimed “a well-known presenter” gave a 20-year-old crack cocaine user “more than £35,000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images”.

The most powerful of the newspaper’s allegations was that the young person was under 18 when they allegedly began selling pictures to the BBC presenter - raising the possibility that a serious criminal offence may have been committed. 

Now the Sun is insisting it never alleged any illegal behaviour took place. The person at the centre of the story, now aged 20 and legally an adult, has also insisted the newspaper’s claims of underage activity are “rubbish”.

At Cop26 in Glasgow last year, “a historic, collective achievement” was forged between 200 countries – the Glasgow climate pact. Since then, unprecedented global events have threatened this commitment to limiting climate destruction, and the hopes of “keeping 1.5 alive” have been dashed.

"After more than seven decades in waiting, King Charles III has been crowned in Westminster Abbey by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. The St Edward’s Crown was placed on the King’s head after a small struggle. It’s the only time Charles will wear it in his life.

In the lavish and archaic ritual not seen in Britain since 1953, the king was anointed with holy oil and swore the oath of kings, before his wife, Queen Camilla, was then presented with the royal sceptre and the rod of equity and mercy, and also enthroned.

"This is the moment an earthquake of magnitude 5.8 struck near Melbourne in Australia.

ABC journalists Michael Rowland and Tony Armstrong were in the studio for the breakfast show when the earthquake hit, shaking the TV set.

According to Geoscience Australia, two earthquakes were recorded in quick succession.

The first, felt in Melbourne, parts of New South Wales and northern Tasmania, is now listed as a magnitude 5.8 – a downgrade from earlier reports – at a depth of 10km. That took place at 9.15am AEST.

Then there was a magnitude 4 earthquake at 9.33am, at a depth of 12km.

It is the strongest earthquake reported in Victoria, and possibly the strongest experienced in the state in up to 200 years.

"In an unexpected move, Britney Spears’ father has filed a request to terminate the controversial conservatorship that has controlled the singer’s life for 13 years.

Jamie Spears, who is the conservator of his daughter’s estate, said “recent events” called into question whether she still needed a court to oversee her personal affairs and finances.

Britney Spears, was placed under the conservatorship, a complex legal arrangement usually reserved for the very old or frail, in 2008 after suffering a series of mental breakdowns.

Spears has twice addressed the court in recent months, describing the conservatorship as “abusive”. She has not performed since 2018 and has said she would not return to the stage while her father was conservator.

Jamie Spears’ representatives have previously defended the conservatorship and his role in the arrangement. Her father long had control over her finances and healthcare, but stepped down as a personal conservator in 2019. A licensed conservator now oversees her medical treatment, and her father has maintained authority over her money.

But the new filing at a court in Los Angeles states: “Ms Spears has told this court that she wants control of her life back without the safety rails of a conservatorship.

“She wants to be able to make decisions regarding her own medical care, deciding when, where and how often to get therapy. She wants to control the money she has made from her career and spend it without supervision or oversight.

“She wants to be able to get married and have a baby, if she so chooses. In short, she wants to live her life as she chooses without the constraints of a conservator or court proceeding.”

Britney’s lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, said he welcomed the termination request by her father, and that it was a victory and vindication for the singer, before adding; “It appears that Mr Spears believes he can try to avoid accountability and justice, including sitting for a sworn deposition and answering other discovery under oath, but as we assess his filing .. we will also continue to explore all options.”

The next hearing is scheduled for 29 September.

"'I had monkeypox, this is what I learned'

Harun Tulunay, a sexual health worker, contracted monkeypox in early June.

He suffered severe symptoms of the virus, including fever, aches and blisters but is now fully recovered and back to health.

The monkeypox outbreak has hit Europe the hardest with cases rising every day. Cases have also been reported in the US, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, Israel, Brazil, Mexico and other countries.

While anyone can get monkeypox, the virus is largely spreading among men who have sex with men, particularly those who report having new or multiple sexual partners.

The number of cases around the world is increasing, and the World Health Organization has called the outbreak a global health emergency.

Now @haruntulunay wants to share his first-hand experience with monkeypox to help people better understand the virus.

"For the first time ever, scientists have confirmed the Amazon rainforest is now emitting more carbon dioxide than it is able to absorb.

The giant forest had previously been a carbon sink, absorbing the emissions driving the climate crisis, but is now causing its acceleration, researchers said.

The emissions amount to a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, according to a study. Most are caused by fires, many deliberately set to clear land for beef and soy production. But even without fires, hotter temperatures and droughts mean the south-eastern Amazon has become a source of CO2, rather than a sink.

Growing trees and plants have taken up about a quarter of all fossil fuel emissions since 1960, with the Amazon playing a major role as the largest tropical forest. Losing the Amazon’s power to capture CO2 is a stark warning that slashing emissions from fossil fuels is more urgent than ever, scientists said.

The government of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been harshly criticised for encouraging more deforestation, which has surged to a 12-year high, while fires hit their highest level in June since 2007.

"‘I will never not miss him’

Lauren Miller was ecstatic when she found out she was pregnant and even happier when she discovered she would be having twins. However, her joy quickly turned into devastation when doctors told her one of her twins had Edwards syndrome.

Her pregnancy threatened her life, and that of her healthy baby. In order to save the other twin, Lauren was forced to flee Texas in order to get an abortion. Now, she is one of 15 women suing the state.

“I can’t help but think how I was directly put in this situation because of Texas’s restrictive abortion laws,” Lauren writes in a diary that she kept during her pregnancy and abortion process.

“I guess I’m lucky,” she writes. “If you have out-of-state resources, thousands of dollars at your disposal, time to take off work, childcare, ability to travel, you can find the abortion that you need. But for everyone else? You’re screwed.”

"Breaking: Rishi Sunak has won the Conservative leadership contest and will become the UK's third prime minister in the space of seven weeks, taking over from Liz Truss.

The former chancellor, who has been an MP for seven years and was in the cabinet for just over two years, was confirmed as the winner on Monday after the only other remaining candidate, Penny Mordaunt, failed to reach the threshold of 100 nominations from her fellow MPs. Former prime minister Boris Johnson pulled out of the accelerated leadership contest last night.

Sunak, whose parents are of Punjabi Indian heritage, will be the first person of colour to become UK prime minister, as well as the first practising Hindu selected for the job. He is not the first minority ethnic PM – Benjamin Disraeli, who held the office twice between 1868 and 1880, was of Jewish heritage.

Sunak is likely to formally take over as prime minister from Truss in the next day or so. If he takes over tomorrow, Truss will have served as prime minister for just 50 days, the shortest tenure in history.

"Raising her arms in an “X” shape above her head, Raven Saunders took silver in the shot put and made the first podium protest of the Tokyo Olympic Games.

Saunders, who is black and gay, said the gesture represented “the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet”. The 25-year-old also said she wanted it to help “people all around the world who are fighting and don’t have the platform to speak up for themselves”.

The American athlete has suffered from mental health problems and paid tribute to her “communities” after her silver medal on Sunday. She added that younger people were more open to differences than previous generations.

“I really think that my generation really don’t care,” Saunders said. “At the end of the day, we really don’t care. Shout out to all my black people. Shout out to all my LGBTQ community. Shout out to all my people dealing with mental health. At the end of the day, we understand it’s bigger than us and it’s bigger than the powers that be. We understand that there’s so many people that are looking up to us, that are looking to see if we say something or if we speak up for them.”

Like many other athletes at Tokyo 2020, most notably gymnast Simone Biles, Saunders said she has sometimes struggled with the pressures of elite sport - adding that she had been helped by reaching out to her former therapist.

The International Olympic Committee has banned athletes from protesting on the podium, although they are allowed to “express their views” at press conferences. On Monday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said they were looking into the incident but did not elaborate on what punishment, if any, the American would face.

The shot put was won by Gong Lijiao of China. New Zealand’s Valerie Adams, the 2008 and 2012 champion, won bronze.

"In a world-first that has delighted conservationists, a baby gorilla has been born in the wild in west Africa from two parents who grew up in captivity in Europe.

The baby's mother Mayombe, 13, was born in the ZooParc de Beauval in France, while 15-year-old father Djongo was raised in the Port Lympne Safari Park in southeast England. Both were later introduced to the wild.

The newborn gorilla is thought to have been born on the night of 13 June in The Bateke Plateau National Park in the southeast of Gabon.

""It's extraordinary news, a very significant world-first for the conservation of this species which is in serious danger of becoming extinct,"" Delphine Delord, assistant director of Beauval zoo, told AFP.

The Aspinall Foundation, which runs the Port Lympne Safari Park, has reported the infant gorilla to be in good health. The foundation says on its website that the number of western lowland gorillas, which are found in Gabon, has declined by 60 percent in the past 20-25 years.

"Known as 'that sand girl' on TikTok, 24-year-old Franziska Trautmann is trying to help restore eroding coastlines in America ... with glass sand.

The idea started as many good ones do – while drinking a bottle of wine with her co-founder Max Steitz in college. The pair realised the bottle would end up in a landfill so decided to take action and launch Glass Half Full; the only glass recycling facility in Louisiana.

The state loses about an American football field's worth of land every 100 minutes due to: rising sea levels, heavy storms which wash the land away, and salt water intrusion where sea water infiltrates fresh water wetlands and kills the native plant life.

And this is a truly global issue. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that If the world continued to emit carbon at the rate it was in 2020, sea levels will rise by an estimated 80cm by 2100. If this happens 13% of the planet’s ice-free coastline will go under water.

What's more - is that sand is the most exploited resource in the world after water but its use is largely ungoverned, meaning we are consuming it faster than it can be naturally replaced.

So far @glasshalffull.nola has diverted more than 2.2m lbs of glass from landfills, and the team is working with scientists to expand its work to other parts of the world experiencing coastal erosion.

And we know what you're thinking ... no - the sand won't cut you.

"“Sickle cell disease has defined me, defined my body and made a big dent to my dreams ... No matter how hard I fight, it continues to defeat me. A new treatment brings hope and might make dreaming possible again.”

That's what Toks Odesanmi, a finance specialist and patient at Cambridge University hospitals trust, said after the NHS announced that thousands of people in England are to benefit from the first new therapy for two decades for the serious and lifelong health condition.

Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder - particularly common in people with an African or Caribbean background - characterised by red blood cells that assume an abnormal, rigid, curved shape, resembling a sickle. It can cause severe pain and organ failure, often requiring hospital admissions.

Crizanlizumab, a “revolutionary” life-changing drug treatment, is delivered by a transfusion drip and works by binding to a protein in the blood cells to prevent the restriction of blood and oxygen supply. The therapy will help at least 5,000 people over the next three years, officials said.

Current treatments to prevent sickle cell crises include a tablet called hydroxycarbamide and regular blood transfusions, but these are not always effective for people with severe forms of the disease.

“This revolutionary treatment will help to save lives, allow patients to have a better quality of life and reduce trips to A&E by almost half,” said Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England.

"“Talent are paid pennies. They make nothing.”

It’s back to work for Hollywood writers after a five-month strike shut down many of America’s top shows. Union leaders have reached an agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers after a row over pay and the use of artificial intelligence in the industry.

The actor and writer Franchesca Ramsey joins Chanté Joseph on our Pop Culture podcast this week to talk about the deal the Writers Guild of America has struck with Hollywood studios and what life has really been like on the picket line.
 
They also take a closer look at the long-term influence of the Hollywood strikes on the industry, where some reality stars begin their battle to unionise and speak out about their experiences of working with little to no pay.

“On these dating shows sometimes they’re getting $35 dollars a day,” Franchesca explains.

"The Women's Euros 2022 has already been a landmark moment for football. 

We have been treated to the women’s game at its best, both with the quality of play and the excellence and vibrance of the fans in the stands. 

People have turned out in historic numbers, not just for the sold-out England matches but elsewhere, too. The attendance record for a non-host nation match (not including a final) has been broken three times. Fifteen games in, Uefa had surpassed the 240,045 tickets sold in 2017.

There have been countless moments to celebrate, but players and spectators have criticised the England team’s lack of racial diversity.

The set-up of elite women’s football in England needs to change – and saying so is not a criticism of this squad or manager, writes former footballer and Guardian columnist Anita Asante.

"The royal family and the country have said a “last farewell” to Queen Elizabeth II during a state funeral at Westminster Abbey.

Nine-year-old Prince George and his seven-year-old sister, Princess Charlotte, were the youngest mourners to walk behind their great-grandmother’s coffin. King Charles III and his three younger siblings, Anne, Andrew and Edward, led the procession, followed by Charles's sons, Princes William and Harry, and other senior members of the royal family.

Speaking to the 2,000-strong congregation, which included royalty, world leaders and members of the British establishment, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said during the service: “People of loving service are rare in any walk of life. Leaders of loving service are still rarer. But in all cases those who serve will be loved and remembered when those who cling to power and privileges are long forgotten.”

The Queen’s coffin will now be transferred to Windsor Castle, where there will be a committal service in St George’s Chapel. She will be buried in the castle’s King George VI Memorial Chapel, alongside her father, her mother, and her sister’s ashes.

The coffin of her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year, will also be moved from the royal vault in St George’s Chapel to be interred with the Queen, as the couple requested.

"Presenters on a TV programme in Qatar have celebrated Germany’s exit from the World Cup by mocking the team’s stance on human rights. In a clip circulated on social media, presenters waved goodbye to the Germany team while clamping hands over their mouths – a send-up of the gesture the players had made before their opening game against Japan.

Germany had been planning to wear the OneLove armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar until Fifa announced at the last moment that they would face sporting sanctions for doing so. Instead, the players posed with hands over their mouths to indicate they felt they had been silenced.

"If Solomon Islands continues logging at its current rate, natural forests in the country will be exhausted in 15 years, the Ministry of Finance has said.

The South Pacific nation is a striking example of the enormous cost of the logging industry. While it has been a source of revenue for the country and employment for its people, logging has erased significant portions of its forestry and resulted in environmental hazards for local communities.

In the last few decades, foreign-owned companies have moved into the Pacific region, clearing huge swathes of lush forest, exporting vast quantities of timber and sometimes leaving environmental devastation and social destruction in their wake.

"Beijing 2022: A Winter Olympics that was farcical, disturbing and often exceptional, writes our chief sports writer Sean Ingle.

In his latest @guardian_sport article, he said: ""At the end of a Winter Olympics like no other, moments before a furious barrage of fireworks tattooed the Beijing skyline, the German president of the IOC gave an extraordinarily upbeat assessment of these Games.

“The Olympic spirit could only shine so brightly because the Chinese people set the stage in such an excellent way – and in a safe way,” Thomas Bach said.

It had been, Bach added, a “truly exceptional” Winter Games. Exceptional? Yes. But in myriad ways: good and bad.

In his latest guardiansport article he said At the end of a Winter Olympics like no other moments before a furious barrage of fireworks tattooed the Beijing skyline the German president of the IOC gave an extraordinarily upbeat assessment of these Games

The Olympic spirit could only shine so brightly because the Chinese people set the stage in such an excellent way  and in a safe way Thomas Bach said

It had been Bach added a truly exceptional Winter Games Exceptional Yes But in myriad ways good and bad

"We're going to need a bigger bowl ...

Authorities in Minnesota have appealed to aquarium owners to stop releasing pet fish into waterways, after several huge goldfish were pulled from a local lake.

Officials in Burnsville, about 15 miles south of Minneapolis, said released goldfish can grow to several times their normal size and wreak havoc on indigenous species.

“Please don’t release your pet goldfish into ponds and lakes!” the city tweeted. “They grow bigger than you think and contribute to poor water quality by mucking up the bottom sediments and uprooting plants.”

Last November, officials in nearby Carver county removed as many as 50,000 goldfish from local waters. The county water management manager, Paul Moline, said goldfish “are an understudied species” with “a high potential to negatively impact the water quality of lakes”.

Like carp, goldfish can easily reproduce and survive through low levels of oxygen during the Minnesota winter.

“A few goldfish might seem to some like a harmless addition to the local water body – but they’re not,” the state's department of natural resources advised.

"Nearly 150,000 red hearts – one for everyone in Britain who has died so far from coronavirus – have been painted by bereaved family and friends of the pandemic's victims in London.

“This is an outpouring of love. Each heart is individually hand-painted; utterly unique, just like the loved ones we’ve lost. And, like the scale of our collective loss, this memorial is going to be enormous,” said Matt Fowler, whose 56-year-old father, Ian, died last April.

Fowler co-founded the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which is setting up the memorial.

“We know not everyone can come down here to see it but we really hope this can become a focal point for remembering this national tragedy. We have placed it at the heart of our capital so that the government never loses sight of the personal stories at the heart of all this.”

"Four dogs, one mission: to sniff-search for mines left by the Islamic State in northern Iraq.

Branco, an eight-year-old Belgian shephard is part of the elite team of canines detecting the underground explosives so that a mine-clearing team can get rid of them.

ISIS produced thousands of these mines when the terror group held sway over this part of Iraq and commandeered plastics factories in their Mosul base.

A single mine, known as VS50, could fit on the palm of your hand, and contains about 100g of explosives. The pressure pad is sensitive enough for a child to activate, even through 30cm of packed earth. The explosion can take out an armoured vehicle.

Branco is trained to sniff ahead in a controlled manner and stop if he gets a scent – so he doesn’t tread on the mine.

Belgian and German shepherds are used because they are most adept at distinguishing scents.

"Britain’s youngest MP, Nadia Whittome, has been told to take several weeks off work by her doctor after she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

"""I think no picture or videos can really justify the true feelings and emotions when you are so close by this wonder.""

That's what photographer Arnar Kristjans said after capturing this image and video of crowds watching the line of fire as lava spewed from an Icelandic volcano on Friday.

Eruptions like this one began in March - the first of its kind in more than 800 years. The visuals here show a crater close to Mount Fagradalsfjall near the capital Reykjavik.

While Iceland’s Keflavik international airport, the country’s largest, and the small fishing port of Grindavik are only a few kilometres away, the area is uninhabited and the eruption is not expected to present any danger.

Volcanic eruptions in the region are known as effusive eruptions, where lava flows steadily out of the ground, as opposed to explosive ones.

"In the US, 12% of people took 66% of all flights in 2018.
In France, 2% of people took half of the flights.
In China, 5% of households took 40% of flights and in India just 1% of households took 45% of all the flights.

This data is from a new report by environmental charity Possible which collated data from the countries with the highest aviation emissions.

The report shows a worldwide pattern of a small group taking a large proportion of flights, while many people do not fly at all.

Possible, the group that produced the new report, is calling for the introduction of a frequent flyer levy, whereby the first flight in a year incurs little or no tax and it therefore does not penalise annual family holidays. But the levy then ramps up for each additional flight.

“This report shows [that] while the poorest communities are already suffering the impacts of a warming climate, the benefits of high-carbon lifestyles are enjoyed only by the few.

It has prompted the return of border closures, mandatory testing and many mask mandates as nations attempt to slow its spread.

"Does this paint look extra white to you?

It's the whitest-ever paint and has been produced by academic researchers with the aim of boosting the cooling of buildings and tackling the climate crisis.

It can even give a greater cooling power than common central air conditioners.

The new paint reflects 98% of sunlight as well as radiating infrared heat through the atmosphere into space. In tests, it cooled surfaces by 4.5C below the average air temperature, even in strong sunlight.

Currently available reflective white paints are far better than dark roofing materials, but they can't cool surfaces below the average air temperature like this new paint can.

White-painted roofs have been used to cool buildings for centuries. As global heating pushes temperatures up, the technique is also being used on modern city buildings, such as in Ahmedabad in India and New York City in the US.

Project Drawdown, a charity that assesses climate solutions, estimates that white roofs and green roofs could avoid between 600m and 1.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, roughly equivalent to two to three years of the UK’s total annual emissions.

"“I’m homeless again”, said the London jewellery designer Isabelle White, after finding out the new apartment complex she moved into three weeks ago could be demolished. 

Isabelle was on her way for a haircut when she first learned the news from the Guardian’s social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth. 

“It seemed too good to be true and now obviously it is. Moving in I thought there were a lot of things that didn’t make sense,” she said.

Earlier that day, Greenwich council had announced that the developer, Comer Homes Group, must raze the buildings because of 26 major changes from the originally agreed plan. The council called it a “mutant development that is a blight on the landscape”.

Comer Homes said it would appeal against the decision and said it was “extremely disappointed” with the move. 

The complex only opened last year in a borough with a social housing waiting list of more than 20,000 households. Demolition and rebuilding could cost more than £160m, an industry source estimated.

“Webb’s image of Rho Ophiuchi allows us to witness a very brief period in the stellar lifecycle with new clarity,” said Klaus Pontoppidan, a Webb project scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. 

“Our own sun experienced a phase like this, long ago, and now we have the technology to see the beginning of another star’s story.”

"""Our future hinges on your decision"".

Martin Luther King Jr's 13-year-old granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, has issued a stark warning to Democratic lawmakers who have been accused of stalling new voting rights legislation that aims to protect voters from racial discrimination.

Vice-president Kamala Harris has said that the right to vote in the US was “under assault” and tens of millions of Americans faced potential disenfranchisement unless threatened voting rights legislation was passed.

Activists want politicians to pass two measures aimed at expanding voting rights across the country – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.

This is seen as crucial in the face of a wave of Republican state legislation that is aimed at erecting barriers to voting that is likely to suppress the votes of communities of color.

But two Democrats, senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have remained opposed to changing filibuster rules, which are necessary to move the bills through.

In a statement last week, King III spoke of his father, who would have turned 93 on Saturday and said that the “stakes could not be higher to protect and expand” his father’s legacy of activism and racial justice.

Speaking on the public holiday MLK day yesterday, this was Yolanda Renee King's message to lawmakers: ""Do not celebrate. Legislate.""

So why exactly are US voting rights under threat - and how is the filibuster related? Click the link in bio to read more.

"It has been termed “the Great Resignation” and a “turnover tsunami”. But whether it is because of a shift in priorities during the pandemic or simply a desire for a change, many people have left their jobs, or are thinking of leaving.

In the US, the department of labour reported a record 4m resignations in April. A Microsoft survey of more than 30,000 workers worldwide revealed that 41% were considering quitting or changing professions this year. In the UK and Ireland, research by the HR software company Personio found 38% of respondents were planning to quit in the next six to 12 months.

But how do you know if you are in desperate need of change or just in a pandemic funk. Here are 17 questions to ask yourself to help you clarify your thinking – and your future.

"The actor Angela Lansbury, best known as Jessica Fletcher in the TV series Murder, She Wrote and for numerous film and theatre roles, has died aged 96. She died in her sleep on Tuesday, just five days before her 97th birthday, her family has announced.

Lansbury was born in London in 1925, to Irish actor Moyna Macgill and Edgar Lansbury, a politician and timber merchant who died when she was nine. Following the Blitz, Lansbury, two of her siblings and her mother relocated to the US, where she trained at New York’s Feagin School of Drama and Radio. She went on to receive an Oscar nomination for her first film role, aged 19, in the 1944 film Gaslight, and starred in the hit film National Velvet, as well as a steady stream of other MGM productions during the 1940s.

After more minor roles, Lansbury came to prominence once again in the 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate, however it wasn’t until 1966, when she took the lead title in the musical Mame, that she reached widespread prominence. 

However, she will be best known to many for playing the role of Jessica Fletcher in the US crime drama Murder, She Wrote. An international success, the whodunit drama ran from 1984 and 1996 and made a global star of the actor who played its lead, a crime writer and would-be detective. She also exec produced the show, via Corymore Productions, a production company she started with her late husband Peter Shaw, who died in 2003. Lansbury also notably voiced Mrs Potts in the 1991 Disney film Beauty and the Beast.

Lansbury received five Tony Awards, six Golden Globes and an Olivier Award as well as an Honorary Oscar and a Lifetime Achievement Award from BAFTA over the course of her career.

"How do you feel about the government targeting you with adverts or campaigns to try and change how you act?

A new form of “influence government”, which uses sensitive personal data to craft campaigns aimed at altering behaviour has been “supercharged” by the rise of big tech firms, researchers have warned.

A Guardian exclusive by technology editor Alex Hern reveals that a shift to this new brand of governance comes from a marriage between the introduction of psychological 'nudge theory' in policymaking, and an online advertising infrastructure that opens up huge opportunities to run targeted campaigns.

"Did you see the supermoon? 🌝

The first of the year has been spotted in Spain, Russia, Greece and Argentina.

According to the Old Farmer’s Almanac - which is a book containing astronomical data - this supermoon is called the ‘full buck moon’, named after the antlers of male deers which are growing at this time of year.

A supermoon occurs when the full moon takes place at or near the lunar perigee, which means its closest approach to the Earth.

When the full moon occurs at or around this point in its orbit, it appears larger and brighter than other full moons.

"On the first day of the Olympics there was not a single shot of an athlete taking a knee on the official Tokyo 2020 live blog, Facebook and Twitter pages or Instagram. 

But the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have now performed a U-turn over their stance to stop their social media teams from posting pictures of athletes taking the knee at these Games.

The decision comes after the Guardian revealed they had issued a diktat against showing such images just hours before Team GB’s women’s first football match against Chile on Wednesday. United States and Sweden players, as well as those from New Zealand, all also took a knee in protest against racism.

An insider told @guardian_sport they found the IOC’s stance odd given the organisation celebrates iconic pictures of protest – including Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists to protest against the unfair treatment of black people in the United States at the 1968 Olympics.

However on Thursday morning Tokyo time on Twitter the @Olympics account tweeted a picture of Lucy Bronze taking a knee – along with a message: “Sports started yesterday. Just some of the highlights: Japan starting strong in softball. Teams were kneeling before the competition.”

Athletes at these Games are allowed to protest after the IOC relaxed Rule 50, which had previously forbidden athletes to make any kind of “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas”.

Peaceful protest is now allowed on the field of play, provided it is done without disruption and with respect for fellow competitors. However, sanctions are still threatened for any protests made on the medal podium.

"What do you think of this statue?

The sculpture of a woman in a transparent dress from a 19th-century poem has sparked controversy in Italy.

The bronze statue was unveiled on Saturday in the town of Sapri during a ceremony attended by the former prime minister Giuseppe Conte, surrounded by a mostly male entourage.

The work by the sculptor Emanuele Stifano is a tribute to La Spigolatrice di Sapri (The Gleaner of Sapri), written by the poet Luigi Mercantini in 1857. The poem is based on the story of a failed expedition against the Kingdom of Naples by Carlo Pisacane, one of the first Italian socialist thinkers.

But a group of female politicians from the centre-left Democratic party have called for the statue to be knocked down. They argue it reflects nothing of the anti-Bourbon revolution nor the “self-determination of a woman who chooses not to go to work in order to take sides against the oppressor”.

Laura Boldrini, a deputy with the party, said the statue was an “offence to women and the history it should celebrate”.

Meanwhile, Stifano has defended his work in a Facebook post, saying it was “useless” to try to explain artwork to those “who absolutely only want to see depravity”.

"“All we’re talking about is a brick wall, but the symbolism’s a lot more...”

It’s been 25 years since the Good Friday Agreement brought an end to the troubles in Northern Ireland, but 100 “peace” walls still divide Catholic and Protestant communities across the country.

The Guardian met Rachel and Kyra, two peace-builders in Derry, who are trying to build relations with two communities in their city.

It’s a slow, delicate process which they say has been put under strain by the cost of living crisis.

"In two months, Elina Tsybulchenko says she saw the sun twice.

Trapped inside a bunker in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, Ukraine, under constant Russian shelling, the 54-year-old said ""they bombed like every second"".

""Dogs barked and children screamed,” she said. “But the hardest moment was when we were told our bunker would not survive a direct hit.
“We understood that it would just be a mass grave and no one could save us under fire,” she added. “It would be impossible to save us.""

Tsybulchenko, who used to work at the site doing quality control, sought shelter there after shelling destroyed her home. She is one more than 100 civilians who managed to escape during a brief ceasefire over the weekend, in an operation overseen by the UN and the Red Cross.

“You can’t imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking,” she said from Zaporizhzhia, about 230km north-west of Mariupol.

“We were praying to god that missiles fly over our shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all of us would be done.”

"What was your guess?

The oil giant Shell has reported a record quarterly profit of $9.1bn (£7.3bn) for the first three months of 2022.

That's almost three times the $3.2bn it made in the same quarter a year earlier, and 43% higher than in the last quarter of 2021 - and even more than analysts had forecast.

Now, the British government is facing growing pressure to implement a windfall tax on companies benefiting from soaring oil and gas prices – which could in turn be used on initiatives to reduce the burden of rising energy bills and the cost of living crisis.

In the UK, living standards are set to fall at their fastest rate since records began in the mid-1950s, with real household incomes falling by 2.2% this year, and energy and food prices increasing.

“I literally have to choose between food and heat and hot water. I’ve not felt so desperate in my lifetime,"" says Charlotte Littlefield, 47, a mother-of-four who relies on food banks.

So what is a windfall tax?

Governments typically use these one-off levies as a tax on companies receiving outsized profits as a result of factors beyond their control, like high energy prices.

Companies that get oil and gas from the Earth are now getting much more money than they were last year because the demand has increased, partly as society emerges from the pandemic, but also due to supply concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"The actor Hank Azaria has apologised “to every single Indian person” for his portrayal of Apu in The Simpsons.

Azaria, who is white, voiced the role of the Indian American shopkeeper from the show’s inception in 1989 but stood down last year amid criticism of racial stereotyping.

Speaking on the Armchair Expert podcast hosted by the actors Dax Shepard and Monica Padman, Azaria said that though he believed the show was founded on good intentions, it contributed to structural racism in the US.

He added that it had also taken him some time to realize that his portrayal of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon was offensive to the Indian American community.

To Padman, who is Indian American, he said: “I really do apologise. I know you weren’t asking for that but it’s important. I apologise for my part in creating that and participating in that. Part of me feels I need to go round to every single Indian person in this country and personally apologise.”

Earlier this year Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, told the BBC the show was striving for inclusivity. Last year he announced that non-white characters would no longer be voiced by white actors.

"""Heroes come and go, but legends are forever.""

This is the famous Kobe Bryant quote that has been inscribed on a new statue paying tribute to the basketball icon, his daughter Gianna, and the seven others killed in a helicopter crash two years ago.

Sculptor Dan Medina, who created the memorial, said: ""On this day, the second anniversary of the accident, I decided to bring it up from sunrise to sunset and create a bit of a healing process for fans.""

The 160-pound bronze sculpture, which has been placed at site of the crash in Calabasas, California, for one day has the names of all nine victims engraved on the steel pedestal: Kobe Bryant, Gianna 'Gigi' Bryant, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, Alyssa Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, John Altobelli, Christina Mauser and Ara Zobayan.

A five-time NBA champion in his 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant's death at age 41 shocked the world of sports and sent his legions of fans into mourning. Gianna was 13 at the time of the crash, which occurred as they were headed to a youth basketball tournament.

Tributes to Bryant from friends, fans and former teammates have poured in across social media today.

""I know many of you are out there and you miss him and still wish to see his brilliance on the court, and what he was doing as a dad,"" Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said of Bryant, who was the father of four girls and husband to Vanessa.

""It was wonderful the way he was coaching girls and getting them into the game. I hope all of you out there remember him the way you should and give your prayers to his wife and family.""

"This video captured the raw humanity of the moment: a Red Cross volunteer tenderly consoling a Senegalese man moments after he stepped foot in Spain’s north African enclave of Ceuta.

Hours after the footage went viral, however, Luna Reyes set her social media accounts to private when she was targeted by a torrent of abuse from supporters of Spain’s far-right Vox party and others incensed by the unprecedented arrival of 8,000 migrants in Ceuta.

“They saw that my boyfriend was Black, they wouldn’t stop insulting me and saying horrible, racist things to me,” the 20-year-old, told the Spanish television channel RTVE. 

As news spread of the abuse, the internet began fighting back. Messages hailing the hug soon began pouring in, drowning out the insults and sending the hashtag #GraciasLuna trending in Spain.

“We will not allow hatred to win,” Rita Maestre, a councillor for the city of Madrid, said on Twitter. “Those of us who see this embrace as a symbol of the best of our country outnumber the others.”

"How would you define quiet quitting?

Rather than working late on a Friday evening, or volunteering to supervise the boss’s teenager on work experience, experts say many employees are stepping away from doing work beyond their job remit.

Instead, they are doing just enough in the office to keep up, then leaving work on time and muting Slack.

With more than 8.7m views on TikTok, #QuietQuitting is thought to have been inspired by Chinese social media's #TangPing, or lying flat, which is a now censored hashtag that was apparently prompted by the country's shrinking workforce and long-hours culture.

"""I think Ghoramara will disappear underwater within 10 or 15 years.""

Throughout the 2021 UN climate change conference, Cop26, we will be publishing the stories of the people whose lives have been devastated by the climate breakdown.

This is Sunil Kandar's story:

I live in the Hatkhola locality of Ghoramara [in India]. I remember how on this island, during my childhood, I had a very happy and enjoyable life. We had a big mud-walled house. We also had large farmland of our own where rice and other vegetables grew. We sold a big part of our farm produce in the market. Like some other families in the island we were pretty rich. The farmland owned by our family was our biggest strength.

Our island is located at the mouth of a river coming from the north. The northern edge of the island began sinking bit by bit under the river water when I was a child. Then, 20 or 25 years ago, the sea began eating away land around the southern edge of the island where we lived. Ghoramara began going underwater almost from all sides and the island began shrinking fast. Farmlands and houses of the people are constantly going underwater.

Cyclones are pounding our island more frequently in recent years. The fragile island is too feeble to keep away the tidal waves... Whatever farmlands are left on the island are turning unusable because of inundation by seawater and increasing salinity of the soil.

Once I owned four acres of farmland. In the past 20 years, three-quarters of it has been lost under the sea. This year I have been forced to buy rice for us, for the first time in my life.

I am over 50 now. I cannot go out of the island, learn a new skill and pick up another job. My son knew he cannot earn a living on this island. So, he left the island and has become a migrant day-wage labourer in south India and sends money to support our family.

Oceanographers and other experts came to the island and conducted studies five years ago. They said the water level around the island is rising and it will perhaps completely vanish underwater by 2050. But in the past five years, the island has been shrinking.

"These California twins were born 15 minutes apart but they won't share a birthday - or even the same birth year.

Aylin Yolanda Trujillo was delivered at Natividad medical center in Salinas at exactly midnight on 1 January, becoming the first baby born in Monterey county in 2022, as the US west coast ushered in a new year.

But her brother, Alfredo Antonio Trujillo, had arrived just before her, at 11.45pm on 31 December, as 2021 came to a close.

The chance of twins being born on different days, months and years is relatively low.

While there were about 3.75m births in the US in 2019, only about 120,000 – or about 3% – were twins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Natividad Medical Center tweeted; ""At midnight, Natividad welcomed Aylin Yolanda Trujillo as the area's first baby of 2022!

"Nearly 400 years after the first English ships arrived in Barbados, the sun has set on the British monarchy’s long reign over the Caribbean island.

As the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, the Royal Standard flag representing the Queen was lowered over a crowded Heroes Square in Bridgetown - marking the birth of the world’s newest republic.

Guests applauded as Dame Sandra Mason was sworn in as the country's first ever president. “Republic Barbados has set sail on her maiden voyage,” Mason said in her inauguration speech, recognising the “complex, fractured and turbulent world” it would need to navigate.

Announcing the decision to cut ties with the monarchy in 2020, prime minister Mia Mottley, who led the ceremony last night, said the time had come for Barbados to “fully leave our colonial past behind”. During the ceremony she also declared musician Rihanna a national hero.

According to those that knew him, Floyd wanted to make a mark with his life, especially if it meant using his athletic abilities, through the NFL or NBA. “George turned to me and said, ‘I want to touch the world,’” Jonathan Veal, a teenage friend of Floyd's, told the New York Times.

Before his death Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job. He had moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, said Christopher Harris, his lifelong friend.

“He was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,” Harris said. “He was happy with the change he was making.”

"""I ignored some of the racism. I perpetrated some of it ... how do I go back and forgive myself?""

The Black Cop, a short film commissioned by Guardian Documentaries and supported by the BFI Doc Society Fund, has been nominated for a BAFTA Film Award.

This intimate portrait of Gamal 'G' Turawa, an ex-Metropolitan police officer, explores his memories of racially profiling and harassing black people and homophobia in his early career.

Now an openly gay man, Turawa’s story is a multi-layered one and sits in the centre of three pivotal moments in recent British history, from the black communities’ resistance of oppressive policing, to the push for LGBTQIA equality and the aftermath of the west African 'farming' phenomenon, where white families took care of black children outside the remit of local authorities.

""In one person and one story we present a villain, victim and hero and begin to understand the potential that we all have in being any one of these, even all three,"" says director and producer @cherishoteka.

""It is a huge honour to have this important and nuanced story recognised by BAFTA. My work aims to provide a platform for often-marginalised communities to tell their stories on their terms.""

"Inside St George’s Chapel, King Charles III listened as the dean of Windsor, David Conner, described how “in the midst of our rapidly changing and frequently troubled world, [the Queen’s] calm and dignified presence has given us confidence to face the future”. 

He watched carefully as the crown he will one day wear was removed from the Queen’s coffin and placed on the altar and appeared visibly moved during the singing of the national anthem.

The king also took the Queen’s Company camp colour of the Grenadier Guards and placed it on his mother’s coffin, to be buried with her before the casket was slowly lowered into the Royal Vault.

This was the last time the Queen’s coffin will be seen publicly ahead of a private ceremony later tonight. 

Elizabeth II is the 11th former monarch to be buried in the chapel in Windsor Castle. She will be buried alongside her father King George VI, the Queen Mother and her sister Margaret. Her late husband, Prince Philip, will have his coffin moved to join her, after his death and burial last year.

"Which of these words do you think you'll start using?

The Korean culture wave has swept through the editorial offices of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), which has added more than 20 new words of Korean origin to its latest edition.

The “definitive record of the English language” included words alluding to the global popularity of the country’s music and cuisine, plus one or two whose roots in the Korean language may be less obvious.

The K- prefix is prominently featured, as you might expect given that so many people outside of South Korea now listen to K-pop – which was added to the OED in 2016 – watch K-dramas or use K-beauty products.

"In a post-Roe America, would you trust a period tracker?

Nearly a third of American women use period tracking apps, according to a 2019 survey published by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

They have helped make women’s lives easier in many ways, from family planning and detecting early signs of health issues to choosing their preferred time for a holiday.

However, many women in the US have been deleting their apps amid fears of their data being used against them in criminal cases in states where abortion is illegal.

Period tracking apps tend to collect all of data from their users. Flo, one of the most popular period tracking apps in the US, has come under fire in the past for sharing its users data after a Wall Street Journal investigation found that the app informed Facebook when a user was on their period or if they intended to get pregnant.

That said, privacy experts believe that it's still possible for these apps to change their ways.

""They should never have owned so much data in the first place. If they adopted practices like storing data locally and minimizing the data to what’s strictly necessary we wouldn’t be having this debate now. It’s not too late for them to do the right thing,” said Eva Blum-Dumontet, a tech policy consultant.

Until then, experts believe that the risk in using third-party period tracking apps remain.

According to Jonathan Lord, UK medical director for MSI Reproductive Choices, the danger will persist until “we treat abortion like all other healthcare – regulated like all other medical procedures, but not criminalized”.

"Weaving a 500-year-old bridge back together.

This Peruvian bridge connected communities across the Apurimac river until it fell into disrepair due to the pandemic and collapsed in March. Members of the affected communities decided to take action and did so using traditional Incan weaving techniques. 

These methods allowed them to rebuild the 30-metre long bridge and cross the river once again. The skills associated with the reconstruction are so significant that Unesco recognised them in 2013. 

“This is history. More than 500 years of a paradox in time. The Q’eswachaka, this Incan living bridge, is really an expression and cultural manifestation,” said the regional governor, Jean Paul Benavente.

"How do you move a country?

To relocate a community ideally needs two things: land and resources, says Simione Botu, the headman of the Vunidogoloa village in Fiji.

The Vunidogoloa village is the first community to relocate as a part of the country’s radical plan to escape rising sea levels.

The climate crisis means dozens of villages could soon be underwater and the Fijian government has already marked 42 communities that need urgent relocating. But moving so many people is an epic undertaking.

"A year to the day after it was first plunged into lockdown, Britain has paused to remember more than 126,284 people who have died of Covid, leaving as many as six million bereaved.

The national “day of reflection” saw landmarks including the London Eye, The Kelpies in Falkirk and Belfast City Hall illuminated in yellow.

The words 'Reflect, Support, Hope' were projected across Lichfield Cathedral, while the inscription in front of Cardiff's Millennium Centre - meaning ""Truth is as clear as glass forged in the flames of inspiration"" - was displayed in yellow light. Blackburn cathedral hosted a display of 4,161 candles, representing every death from Covid in Lancashire.

Across the country, medical and social care staff came to a standstill at 12pm and people later stood on their doorsteps at 8pm with phones, candles and torches to create a “beacon of remembrance”.

For millions of others, however, the anniversary was observed in the same way they have spent most of the last year – quietly, at home.

The British adaptive surfing community is a close-knit group, many of whom have learned or relearned surfing following accidents or diagnoses that could have prevented them from heading out on to the water.

The event last week took place at The Wave, an inland surfing lake on the outskirts of Bristol.

"“A new chapter in the history book.”

That’s what Dr Tom Roa, an iwi kaumātua (elder) and academic said about a Māori tribe landmark settlement that just took place in New Zealand’s House of Representatives.

After decades of fighting for reparations, the Ngāti Maniapoto iwi (tribe) has finally secured a long-awaited apology and millions of dollars in redress for atrocities committed by the crown, including for its “indiscriminate” killings and “massive” alienation of tribal land.

As well as an apology, the Waikato-based iwi of nearly 46,000 members received NZ$177m in financial redress – New Zealand’s fifth-largest sum of its kind – and the return of 36 sites of cultural significance.

The public gallery was full of members of the iwi, who had travelled for nine hours to witness the Maniapoto claims settlement bill become law.

"Forget the blond California stereotypes. New book Afrosurf captures Africa’s overlooked surf culture – and celebrates its heroes, who’d ride colossal waves at beaches they were often banned from.

Afrosurf, published by Mami Wata, takes a whirlwind tour of the African coastline, from the empty breaks of the Horn of Africa, to Morocco, to Senegal, a current buzz destination with one of the largest swell windows in the world.

The book upends the narrative that surfing originated solely in Hawaii and was later adopted by white Americans and Europeans - and digs into the culture – music, art, folklore, food, the chances of meeting a hippopotamus where the waves break – that surrounds an activity that’s as much lifestyle as sport.

"Understandably, after two years of the coronavirus pandemic, any mention of a new viral outbreak is going to be quite alarming.

So it’s no surprise that when countries across Europe and North America started detecting cases of monkeypox, a disease usually found in central and western Africa, there was a bit of a panic.

So far, over 100 confirmed cases have been identified in at least 12 countries. It feels eerily similar to reports of a mystery disease found in Wuhan in 2019 – but is it?

"Ships suspended in mid-air isn't something you usually spot during a stroll along the English coastline.

But David Morris recently had to do a double take, when he noticed a giant tanker evidently floating above the water as he looked out to sea from a hamlet near Falmouth in Cornwall.

The extraordinary sight, which he captured on camera, is an example of an optical illusion known as a superior mirage.

Such illusions are reasonably common in the Arctic but can also happen in UK winters when the atmospheric conditions are right, though they are very rare.

The effect is caused by a meteorological phenomenon called a temperature inversion, when warm air sits on top of a band of colder air and plays havoc with our visual perception. The inversion in Cornwall was caused by chilly air lying over the relatively cold sea with warmer air above.

David Braine, a BBC meteorologist, explains; “Since cold air is denser than warm air, it bends light towards the eyes of someone standing on the ground or on the coast, changing how a distant object appears.”",2021-03-05 19:00:59,"Ships suspended in midair isnt something you usually spot during a stroll along the English coastline

"The US has issued its first passport with an “X” gender designation – a milestone in the recognition of the rights of people who don’t identify as male or female - with the state department saying it expects to be able to offer the option more broadly in 2022.

Jessica Stern, the US special diplomatic envoy for LGBTQ rights, called the moves historic and celebratory, adding that they brought the government documents in line with the “lived reality” that there is a wider spectrum of human sex characteristics than is reflected in the previous two designations.

Dana Zzyym, an intersex Colorado resident who has been in a legal battle with the department since 2015, said their passport is the first US passport to be issued with an ""X"" gender designation.

Zzyym (pronounced Zimm) was denied a passport for failing to check male or female on an application. According to court documents, Zzyym wrote “intersex” above the boxes marked “M” and “F” and requested an “X” gender marker instead.

Zzyym served in the navy as a male but later came to identify as intersex while working and studying at Colorado State University.

The department’s initial denial prevented Zzyym from traveling to a meeting of Organization Intersex International in Mexico.

The state department announced in June that it was moving toward adding a third gender marker for non-binary, intersex and gender-nonconforming people but said it would take time.

A department official said the full passport application and system update with the “X” designation option still need to be approved by the Office of Management and Budget.

The department now also allows applicants to self-select their gender, no longer requiring medical certification if their gender did not match that listed on their other identification documents.

The United States joins a handful of countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Nepal and Canada, in allowing its citizens to designate a gender other than male or female on their passports.

"Nestled away in a leafy London suburb, with residents aged from 58 to 94, New Ground may seem like an unlikely feminist utopia.

But is the UK’s first co-housing community exclusively for older women, who manage the purpose-built development as an alternative to living alone.

At New Ground there are 25 flats with 26 residents. Homes overlook a garden blooming with wildflowers, berries and an orchard. The common meeting room is used for weekly dinners, film nights and yoga classes.

The women manage everything themselves and tasks are divided up among teams of volunteers responsible for maintenance, gardening, communications, cleaning and legal issues.

“The women who started this were adamant that they didn’t want to sit in a day-room singing Daisy Daisy and Pack Up Your Troubles for the rest of their lives,” says Maria Brenton, UK Cohousing Network’s senior ambassador. “We were fiercely opposed to the ageism and paternalism, the infantilisation of older people by social care services.”

"The Queen is under medical supervision at Balmoral after doctors became worried about her health, Buckingham Palace has said.

Prince Charles is at her side, and Prince William was travelling to be with her.

In a statement, the palace said: “Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen’s doctors are concerned for Her Majesty’s health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision.

""The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral Castle.""

Concerns over the health of the 96-year-old head of state escalated when she pulled out of a virtual privy council meeting on Wednesday after doctors ordered her to rest.

Although she met Liz Truss and Boris Johnson on Tuesday, in contrast with tradition, they were required to travel to Balmoral for the change of leadership rather than Buckingham Palace.

"So, these are some of the contenders in an annual competition to find China's ugliest buildings.

The “hall of shame” listing of China’s top 10 “ugliest” buildings has kicked off with 87 bizarre designs in the running, including a violin-shaped church and an Inner Mongolia hotel in the form of a monstrous babushka doll.

Over the past 11 years a Chinese architecture website, archcy.com, has been inviting people to vote in the lighthearted annual contest that it hopes will encourage people to ponder the flexible notion of beauty.

For years, China has been an experimental ground for ambitious domestic and international architects, with mixed results.

There is a national broadcaster building in Beijing, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, that is called “big pants” by Chinese social media users as it looks like a pair of legs (image three).

This year’s competition comes as the central government becomes more prescriptive about architecture. In April the national development and reform commission (NDRC) banned the construction of “ugly buildings”.

The official intervention triggered further curiosity among China’s internet users. On Weibo, the hashtag #BanningUglyArchitecture has been viewed 170m times. Users have also been sharing photos of what they consider “unattractive buildings” across the country.

"The lunar south pole, hidden from Earth’s view, has been described as an area of “mystery, science and intrigue”.

And, until now, no spacecraft has managed to land there.

However, India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft’s Vikram lander touched down on the surface this week in a world first for any space programme — and the historic mission also makes India only the fourth nation to have achieved a controlled landing on the moon.

Now their solar-powered rover will spend two weeks roaming the rocks and boulders and will run a series of experiments to help scientists understand the geology of the moon - and hunt for what could be the moon’s most valuable resource.

And, depending on what it finds, this could be a game-changing moment for space exploration, lunar industry and even establishing possible bases on the moon.

But why? Watch this video for a short explainer from our science reporter Madeleine Finlay – and tap the link in bio to read more about why India’s historic mission is big business for the global space race.

But, she says, the summit ""can only live up to that name if world leaders are prepared to actually deal with the needs of people suffering from a crisis they have played little role in creating.”

As 37 million people are facing starvation in the Horn of Africa, and while negotiators in Sharm el-Sheikh hash out plans for how to help those most vulnerable to climate breakdown, Nakate explains why she thinks it's time for wealthier countries to adopt ‘loss and damage finance’ - and what exactly that means.

“Without the money to recover from extreme weather events there is little hope for countries like mine to survive the next decade,"" says the 25-year-old. Swipe to read more.

"Draped in an Aboriginal flag, independent Australian senator Lidia Thorpe was pulled to the ground while attempting to storm the podium of controversial UK anti-trans activist Kellie-Jay Keen.

The Canberra Times’ Sarah Basford Canales recorded the moment before Thorpe was physically stopped by police from taking the stage at a rally held by Keen in the capital.

Thorpe told @guardianaustralia that transphobia is not welcome on Aboriginal land. “As a sovereign black woman I’ve come to let these people know that they are not welcome on this country.

""We do not tolerate this … on Ngunnawal and Ngambri country.”

Australian Federal Police said the incident involving Thorpe had been referred to the AFP's professional standards command after the senator complained about the actions of officers.

Thorpe was part of a counter-protest to the event of more than 100 people, which outnumbered the crowd of around 30 supporters who had come to see Keen speak as part of a national tour of Australia.

"The California condor is the largest flying bird in North America: it has a wingspan that enables it to soar up to 15,000ft – nearly half the height of a commercial airplane.

Now the birds can claim another remarkable feat: scientists have discovered that females can reproduce without a male partner, in a rare phenomenon known as parthenogenesis.

Oliver Ryder, the director of conservation genetics for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, has called the recent findings a “eureka moment”.

Condors have been imperilled for a century. As Europeans settled the west, they often shot, poisoned and captured the condors, collected their eggs, and reduced their food supply of antelope, elk, and other large wild animals. Their population declined steadily until only 22 remained in 1982, but a state-led recovery program has since successfully bred the animals back from the brink.

The journey that led to discovering the condor’s asexual reproduction also began in the 1980s, when the San Diego Zoo was tasked with developing a test to determine the sex of the few remaining wild condors. Ryder remembers the conversation with his colleague about the strange cases. He got goosebumps as he realized that the condors had reproduced through parthenogenesis – a form of reproduction in which an egg can develop into an embryo without being fertilized by a sperm. 

Condors can live into their 50s, but both of the male chicks born of asexual reproduction were relatively small and died before becoming sexually mature, at 1.9 and 7.9 years old.

Parthenogenesis is derived from the Greek words for “virgin birth” and several insect species including aphids, bees and ants are known to reproduce through the process, although the phenomenon is rare in birds.

The condor is still considered a threatened species, and it remains unclear what solo reproduction will mean in terms of helping with conservation efforts. 

But Ryder says he is delighted that the bird is rewriting scientific understanding; “This is really wondrous and amazing - in the midst of an extinction crisis, scientists are still making big discoveries.”

"From a gummy squirrel to soft coral ...

Scientists have discovered more than 30 potentially new species living at the bottom of the sea.

Researchers from the UK’s Natural History Museum used a remotely operated vehicle to collect specimens from the abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that extends between Hawaii and Mexico. Previously, creatures from this area had been studied only from photographs.

The animals found include segmented worms, invertebrates from the same family as centipedes, marine animals from the same family as jellyfish, and different types of coral.

The findings have potentially important implications for deep-sea mining, as humans become more interested in exploiting minerals from the seabed, because it seems the activity has the potential to disturb many creatures.

The study’s lead author, Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras, of the Natural History Museum, said: “This research is important not only due to the number of potentially new species discovered, but because these megafauna specimens have previously only been studied from seabed images. Without the specimens and the DNA data they hold, we cannot properly identify the animals and understand how many different species there are.”

In a surprise motion just last week, Canada voted to ban LGBTQ ‘conversion therapy’, but the practice is still legal in most parts of the world. In the UK there are proposals to restrict it but not ban it and in the US it's legal in most states.

"“We’ve been excluded”

When 24-year-old Ugandan activist @mnyomb1 arrived in Egypt for the Cop27 climate summit today he was turned away from the high level talks because he did not have the right accreditation.

Only country delegates and some members of the press were allowed in the event for heads of states and government officials.

“Why are we here”, asks Nyombi - adding that the world leaders and negotiators who are currently deciding how far to push climate action need to quickly change the way they work and who they listen to, saying right now he doesn’t think it is right to truly call this an African Cop.

“You have to frontline the voices of African youth activists, because these are the innovators. These are the ones implementing actions, not our leaders, our leaders are just always in the office, but you are excluding us. So it is time to understand that this event is in Africa. We need to give African voices a chance ... We cannot lead without knowledge.”

"What do you think is behind this disparity?

Australian women have poorer health, lower incomes and less engagement in the labour force than men, a new report has found.

A health and wellbeing scorecard, published earlier this month, has found that women’s economic equity and health have deteriorated in the past decade.

Led by researchers at the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, the scorecard will annually document progress in health and wellbeing outcomes in Australia over time.

Prof Helena Teede, the MCHRI’s director and a co-author of the report, said the scorecard highlighted the need for urgent structural change.

“Our workforce productivity is so profoundly affected by the very dramatic impact that childcare has in Australia, because we have one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world,” she said. “At the moment in Australia, having a family has pretty much no impact on a man’s income or their career trajectory; it has a very profound impact for women.”

The MCHRI is calling for the establishment of a national institute that focuses on women’s health, wellbeing and equity.

Jay-Z loves to rap about his roots in Brooklyn’s Marcy housing projects. But while hip-hop’s first confirmed billionaire, whose real name is Shawn Carter, remains intent on not abandoning his roots, residents of the Marcy Houses have expressed annoyance and skepticism at his latest venture, the Bitcoin Academy.

The project is a series of free “financial literacy” courses being offered exclusively to Marcy tenants this summer.

“The simple goal is to provide people tools to build independence for themselves and then the communities around them,” Carter tweeted, calling the course at Marcy “hopefully the first of many”.

But not everyone is sold on the classes. “It’s kind of late to be doing that when people are trying to hold on to their dollars and everything is so expensive,” said 58-year-old retiree Myra Raspberry. “Every dime I get got to go to rent, phone, TV and internet.

Rev Dr William J Barber II sang 'Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around' with the last three survivors of the Tulsa race massacre, centenarians Viola “Mother” Fletcher, Hughes “Uncle Red” Van Ellis and Lessie “Mother Randle” Benningfield Randle in Oklahoma last night.

They were all at the Greenwood Cultural Center in Tulsa where Joe Biden gave a speech - and became the first sitting US president to visit the site where, on 31 May and 1 June 1921, a white mob murdered up to 300 African Americans and burned and looted homes and businesses, razing a prosperous community known as “Black Wall Street”.

"How's this for an archaeological find?

A pre-Incan mummy found in Peru and thought to be between 800 and 1,200 years old has gone on display at the San Marcos University in Lima.

Archaeologists reported finding the pre-Inca Mummy of Cajamarquilla in an underground tomb in November.

The remains, which were discovered with ropes around its hands, were found alongside offerings including ceramics, vegetable remains and stone tools.

It is the latest of many stunning archaeological discoveries in Peru. The South American country, which is home to the iconic Machu Picchu, has hundreds of sites from cultures that developed before and after the Inca Empire, which dominated the southern part of South America 500 years ago.

"A controversial report has been published by the UK government which suggests that Britain is no longer a country where the “system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities”.

The report has been widely condemned by MPs, unions, and equality campaigners as “divisive” and a missed opportunity for systematic change.

One section of the report – on teaching about Britain’s colonial past – says this should include material about the Caribbean experience “which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering, but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a remodelled African/Britain”.

The Labour party said the government “must urgently explain how they came to publish content that glorifies the slave trade”.

Simon Woolley, the director of Operation Black Vote and former chair of the No 10 race disparity unit, gives his thoughts on the report.

"By the time you are reading this, the bosses of Britain’s biggest companies have made more money than the average UK worker will in the entire year, according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else in the country.

The High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, said that by 9am on Friday, the fourth working day of 2022, a FTSE 100 chief executive will have been paid more on an hourly basis than the UK worker’s annual salary, based on median average remuneration figures for both groups.

FTSE 100 chief executives were paid £2.7m on average in 2020, which are the latest full-year figures available. This works out at 86 times the £31,285 average salary for full-time UK workers, according to Office for National Statistics figures.

Most FTSE 100 companies have not yet announced CEO pay for their financial year ending in 2021, but 57% of those that have done so have recorded an increase on 2020 levels, the High Pay Centre report said.

Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which represents 600,000 workers, said the figures showed that bosses were paid 173 times the amount collected by carers who risked their lives on the frontline of the pandemic.

"‘It’s too much, too fast’

Over the past decade, a once bucolic California town has become one of the biggest US hubs for the e-commerce industry.

A 45-minute drive east of Los Angeles, Ontario now has the highest amount of warehouse space in the Inland Empire region, and one of the highest in the US. Within just a few years, the e-commerce and logistics industries have reshaped not only the town’s landscape, but also its air, its job market, its politics and its way of life.

In addition to the 4.1m-square-foot Amazon facility under construction, three other Amazon facilities as well as a sprawl of warehouses for FedEx, Nike, and other companies dot the landscape.

The changes have come quickly, but also quietly. While neighboring communities have been publicly fighting warehouse projects abutting schools and boxing in homes, in Ontario, many residents said they hadn’t noticed just how many new warehouses had cropped up on fallowed fields and along old country roads – until they were surrounded.

“I’ve seen two warehouses go up along my drive to work just since September,” said Andrea Galván, who lives in an older residential neighborhood in northern Ontario.

“It’s too much, too fast,” she said.

As the G7 summit starts up in Cornwall tomorrow, an artist has created a local Mount Rushmore-styled artwork of the leaders of the world’s seven leading industrialised nations - made entirely out of electronic waste.

From left to right, 'Mount Recyclemore' features UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Joe Biden.

The sculpture's creator, Joe Rush, says he wanted to highlight the damage caused by the disposal of electronic devices.

A recent United Nations report suggests more than 53 million tonnes of electronic waste was generated worldwide in 2019 - a rise of over 9 million tonnes since 2014.

"“Because of you, 222 children have gone missing from government facilities.”

This is what activist Alaska Harrison said when immigration minister Robert Jenrick tried to speak at a Conservative party fundraiser in London.

The 10 social justice activists from Green New Deal Rising, an organisation that campaigns for climate and social justice, posed as Tory loyalists and demanded to know what happened to asylum-seeking children who have gone missing from hotels.

More activists popped up from the audience variously accusing the government of acting inhumanely and also failing victims of the Windrush scandal. One activist called on both the home secretary, Suella Braverman, and Jenrick to resign immediately.

Fatima Ibrahim, co-director of Green New Deal Rising, said: ‘Those who stand for justice stand against this government and the rhetoric and actions they use to demonise people who are simply seeking safety. We believe it is the responsibility of our government to provide safety for people facing impossible situations.”

A source close to Jenrick said: “Last night the minister spoke about and fielded questions on a wide range of issues including the contribution of the Windrush generation and asylum-seeking children. It is a shame that these individuals refused to engage in a grown up conversation.”

"""It wasn’t her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself.""

After spending six years as a silent figure detained in Iran, we finally heard Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe speak publicly yesterday at a press conference in London.

Nazanin – dressed in the yellow and blue of Ukraine – began by thanking her family, both in the UK and Iran, before going on to say that her freedom would never be total until other detainees – such as Morad Tahbaz, whose eldest daughter, Roxanne, was also at the presser – were also released.

""Then she let rip,"" writes Guardian political sketch writer John Crace. ""A very controlled fury. Icy, almost steely. We had been warned Nazanin wouldn’t be making any overtly political remarks and that any such statements would be left to Richard and Siddiq. Only no one appeared to have told Nazanin. She wasn’t going to settle for anything cosy and heart-warming. It wasn’t her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself,"" he continues.

At several points during the conference, Zaghari-Ratcliffe differed from her husband when he thanked the British government for bringing her home.

She said she had seen five foreign secretaries over the course of six years, adding: “That is unprecedented given the politics of the UK. I love you Richard, respect whatever you believe, but I was told many, many times: ‘Oh we’re going to get you home.’ That never happened.”

She said this resulted in her finding it difficult to place trust in the words of successive foreign secretaries, adding: “I mean, how many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home? Five?”

“We all know … how I came home. It should have happened exactly six years ago. I should not have been in prison for six years.”

After hearing Zaghari-Ratcliffe speak, some people accused her of being 'ungrateful' – a judgement that was met with a great backlash of people pointing out that she does not owe gratitude, but is instead owed an explanation. Swipe to read more.

"From @guardian_us: Gavin Grimm filed a federal lawsuit in 2015 after he was denied entry to the men's bathrooms at his school. And now, six years later, he has finally been able to declare victory.

This is because the US supreme court has rejected a Virginia school board’s attempt to reinstate a transgender bathroom ban. The justices left in place lower-court rulings that found the policy unconstitutional.

""I am glad that my years-long fight to have my school see me for who I am is over. Being forced to use the nurse's room, a private bathroom, and the girl's room was humiliating for me, and having to go to out-of-the-way bathrooms severely interfered with my education,"" Grimm said in a statement.

""Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials,"" he added.

Last August, the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the board had practiced sex-based discrimination and violated Grimm’s 14th amendment rights by prohibiting him from using the boys’ restroom.

Judge Henry Floyd wrote: “The proudest moments of the federal judiciary have been when we affirm the burgeoning values of our bright youth, rather than preserve the prejudices of the past.”

Upholding the decision of the appeals court sets a strong legal precedent. But because the supreme court has chosen not to hear the case itself, there is still no nationwide ruling on the issue.",2021-06-29 15:00:29,"From guardianus Gavin Grimm filed a federal lawsuit in 2015 after he was denied entry to the mens bathrooms at his school And now six years later he has finally been able to declare victory

Those are the words of @ninagualinga from the Kichwa peoples in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

"Migration is not the biggest challenge facing the world.

It's global inequality.

That's according to research from the development agency @MIDEQHub and their partners in 11 countries in the Global South: Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, Côte d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Malaysia, Nepal and South Africa.

They've produced a new animation - illustrated by @karriefransman and in partnership with @posnegorg - challenging many of the ideas that currently dominate media representations of migration.

Professor Heaven Crawley, Chair in International Migration and Director of MIDEQ said: “For too long the story of migration has been dominated by the views and interests of the Global North. This story has focused on issues of security and border controls, ignoring the complex factors that drive people to move in different parts of the world.

""Migration is a part of our history and will inevitably be part of our future. If we want migration to work for everyone then we need to better understand and address the structural inequalities – poverty, gender inequalities, racism – that drive migration and limit its potential to contribute to development.”

"Today is Earth Day.

It is a global event devoted to recognising the importance of climate action and protecting the environment that has been held since 1970.

This year's theme is 'Invest in Our Planet'. “This is the moment to change it all – the business climate, the political climate, and how we take action on climate. Now is the time for the unstoppable courage to preserve and protect our health, our families, our livelihoods,"" the Earth Day website says.

The above images show how the same spot in Santiago, Chile changed dramatically in just six years. As a punishing, record-breaking drought enters its 13th year, the country has taken the unprecedented decision to ration water for the capital - a city of nearly six million.

“A city can’t live without water,” Claudio Orrego, the governor of the Santiago metropolitan region, said in a press conference last week.

“This is the first time Santiago [in its 491-year history] has a water rationing plan due to the severity of climate change,” Orrego added. “It’s important for citizens to understand that climate change is here to stay. It’s not just global, it’s local.”

The Aculeo Lake, which was for decades one of the main tourist attractions of Santiago's surroundings, has disappeared due to a drought and overconsumption of water.

The government estimates that the country’s water availability has dropped 10% to 37% over the last 30 years and could drop another 50% in northern and central Chile by 2060.

This comes as climate scientists gave what is in effect their final warning for governments on the climate before it is too late. This year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states the world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a “now or never” dash to a low-carbon economy and society.

"What do you think of the Glastonbury line-up? 🏕️

Co-organiser Emily Eavis is facing criticism after the festival confirmed a lineup of all-male headliners for this year’s event.

She said festivals are struggling with a dearth of viable female headliners owing to an industry “pipeline” problem - adding that there needs to be more investment in female musicians to create future headliners.

52% of the 54 names on this week’s partial lineup announcement – with many more acts still to come – are male. Eavis said she remained “entirely focused on balancing our bill. It’s not just about gender, it’s about every aspect of diversity.” 46% of those 54 names are non-white, or feature non-white members.

"This is the first time a member of Europe's most expensive royal family has said, 'no, thank you' to their tax-free salary.

The heir to the Dutch throne, has written to the country's prime minister to waive her right to €1.6m (£1.4m) a year in income and personal and household expenses because accepting it would make her feel “uncomfortable”.

Amalia, the eldest daughter of King Willem-Alexander, who on Thursday passed her school-leaving exams with distinction, said in a handwritten letter to Mark Rutte that she did not want to take up her allowance until she had proper royal duties.

She intended to take a gap year and then begin her undergraduate studies, and aims to repay the €300,000 a year income she was entitled as long as she was still a student, and would not claim €1.3m in expenses “until I incur high costs in my role as Princess of Orange”.",2021-06-14 19:15:10,"This is the first time a member of Europes most expensive royal family has said no thank you to their taxfree salary

Mahabad, people could be seen dancing on the streets. Iran's western, Kurdish-majority areas have seen waves of unrest in recent months amid nationwide protests against the government.

It would be another massive blow to the prime minister’s authority after she was forced to sack Kwasi Kwarteng and rip up her economic strategy to avoid a markets meltdown.

"This is how Olivia Rodrigo described her feelings towards the expectations and double standards that she feels bound by.

In an interview with our deputy music editor Laura Snapes, @oliviarodrigo said she was proud that when her album Sour was released it contained the kind of messy emotions that young women aren’t meant to exhibit.

“I’ve experienced a lot of emotional turmoil over having all these feelings … that I felt like I couldn’t express, especially in my job,” Rodrigo said.

“I’ve always felt like: you can never admit it, be so grateful all the time, so many people want this position. And that causes a lot of repressed feelings.”

Now on her second album, Rodrigo is trying to make sense of her extraordinary young life but when asked about the highlights, she says that moment at Glastonbury 2022 with Lily Allen still stands out.

When the two stars dedicated Allen’s 2009 hit ‘Fuck You’ to “the five members of the supreme court” the day after Roe v Wade was overturned, removing the federal right to abortion in the US.

That’s what music’s for, says Rodrigo, “expressing your rage and dissatisfaction”.

"From Adidas to Zara: new research into the fashion industry’s complex global supply chains shows that a number of large fashion brands are at risk of contributing to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, based on their connections to tanneries and other companies involved in the production of leather and leather goods.

The report, released by Stand.earth on Monday, analysed nearly 500,000 rows of customs data and found that brands such as Coach, LVMH, Prada, H&M, Zara, Adidas, Nike, New Balance, Teva, UGG and Fendi have multiple connections to an industry that props up Amazon deforestation.

Angeline Robertson, an investigative researcher who worked on the study, told us she hopes the fashion industry will take cues from their analysis and “work in their own self-interest”. Adding: “In this time of climate emergency, if the fashion industry wants to be relevant, this is the opportunity.""

This analysis does not prove a direct link between each fashion brand and Amazon deforestation; instead, researchers found connections that increase the probability of any individual garment coming from cattle ranching in the Amazon, an industry described as the No 1 culprit of deforestation in the area.

"‘My life has stood still.'

Until last year, Robin Kyle Reeves lived an active life in Laurel Hill, Florida. But after undergoing laser eye surgery at the recommendation of a doctor, she finds it impossible to stare at screens for an extended period of time and can no longer work or enjoy her hobbies.

“It was supposed to be zip, zap, and within a couple of weeks you’re healed and life goes on,” Reeves said. “But my life has stood still since July 12 of last year.”

Robin’s experience is supposed to be rare. The American Refractive Surgery Council says the procedure’s complication rate is less than 1%. But patient advocates and some experts say that is not the full picture, and that the true complication rate is much higher.

One such expert is Dr Morris Waxler, a retired FDA adviser who voted to approve Lasik in the 1990s. He is now one of its biggest critics, and says he regrets his decision.

"Over 50 years, Dr Jim Taggart created one of Scotland's most magical gardens on the Rosneath peninsula in Argyll and Bute.

This portrait of him in his greenhouse was taken by photographer Robbie Lawrence not long before he died in 2019, aged 84.

The renowned botanist and climate activist welcomed many visitors to his garden - where he and his late son, Jamie, collected around 4,000 plant species from across the world, including rare magnolias and acers, 40 kinds of bamboo, and 300 different rhododendrons.

Taggart's portrait is now just one of a series of stunning images of rural Scotland that Lawrence has included in his first UK solo exhibition, Northern Diary.

It brings together a selection of work he has produced over the past seven years, documenting his relationship with his homeland during a time of political upheaval.

"Growing frustration with Beijing’s strict zero-Covid policy has sparked a wave of unprecedented protests across China.

Groups of people numbering from single digits to about 1,000 have gathered for candlelit vigils and peaceful street protests. In some places, like Wuhan, they have pushed over pandemic barriers, and in Shanghai, clashed with police.

Holding candles, phone lights, and blank pieces of paper, demonstrators have called for the end of lockdowns and frequent mass testing.

Other protests have heard demands for democracy and press freedom, and an end to online censorship.

""For groups of protesters, apparently without central coordination, to take to the streets across China and to social media, and for some then explicitly to call for Xi and the Communist party to stand aside, is a seismic shock,"" writes our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour, adding that: ""Xi is unlikely to tolerate dissent for long.""

"Scientists have found what they called environmentally damaging levels of illegal drugs - including MDMA and cocaine - in the river running through Glastonbury festival owing to people peeing on the land instead of using the toilets and urinals on the site.

Researchers measured levels of illegal drugs in the river before, during and after the last Glastonbury festival, in 2019, comparing levels upstream and downstream of the event.

After the festival three years ago, drug levels in River Whitelake were high enough to harm aquatic wildlife, including a rare eel population, according to the report.

It found that the amount of MDMA was 104 times greater downstream than upstream in the weeks after the festival, rising to levels that could harm the life cycle of European eels, a protected species.

Cocaine concentration was 40 times higher downstream, although the levels of cocaine were not considered harmful to aquatic life.

Ahead of the 2019 festival, Glastonbury’s organisers launched a campaign, Don’t Pee on the Land, to raise awareness of the environmental damage caused by public urination on Worthy farm.

“Peeing on the land at Glastonbury causes pollution of the water table, which can affect local wildlife and fish,” they tweeted in June 2019. “The Environment Agency have the power to close the site if there is too much pollution. Please only pee in the hundreds of toilets and urinals on site.”

In response to the new research, Glastonbury’s spokesperson described public urination as “the biggest threat to our waterways and the wildlife for which they provide a habitat”.

"What time do you go to bed?

A new study suggests there may also be an optimal time to nod off – at least when it comes to heart health. Not too early and not too late, with the sweet spot being between 10pm and 11pm.

The research, published in the journal European Heart Journal – Digital Health, collected data from more than 88,000 participants who wore wrist-based devices for seven days to explore whether there was an association with the time that participants fell asleep at night.

It concluded that going to sleep at 10pm or shortly after is associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with falling asleep earlier or later at night.

The study cannot prove that early or late bedtimes contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease though – not least since when people fall asleep may be linked to other health conditions or behaviours, such as staying out late and drinking, that may be linked to cardiovascular disease risk. Moreover, the research did not look closely at the quality of the participants’ sleep, only length and timing.

However, Dr David Plans, the head of research at Huma Therapeutics and senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, who co-authored the study, said one possibility was that early or late bedtimes might result in individuals missing important cues such as morning daylight, which help to reset the body’s internal clock each day.

If the body clock is not reset properly over a long period of time, “that misalignment of behaviours and the circadian clock increases inflammation and can impair glucose regulation, both of which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease”, Plans said.

The study has further limitations, including that it is based only on data from adults aged 43 to 79, and participants of the UK Biobank – a database of genetic and lifestyle information that researchers are using to investigate myriad health issues – are predominantly white.

Plans said further research, with more participants, is needed to examine the findings, adding there was not enough evidence at present to prescribe a particular bedtime to the public.

"$1.3bn a day.

That's how much Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, and the world's other nine richest billionaires have collectively grown wealthier by since the start of the pandemic while the incomes of 99% of the global population reduced.

That's according to a new report from Oxfam, which suggests that the 10 richest men on the planet have seen their net worth more than double to $1.5tn (£1.01tn) from March 2020 to October 2021.

The study found that a surge in share and property prices has widened the gap between rich and poor, estimating that 3.3 billion people will be living on less than $5.50 per day by 2030.

The charity said World Bank figures showed 163 million more people had been driven below the poverty line while the super-rich were benefiting from the stimulus provided by governments around the world to mitigate the impact of the virus.

They have urged governments to impose a one-off windfall tax of 99% on the value of the increase in the wealth of these top 10 individuals, which Oxfam say could pay for enough jabs to vaccinate the entire world and provide the resources to tackle the climate crisis, provide universal healthcare and social protection, and address gender-based violence in 80 countries.

Even after this 99% levy, the top 10 billionaires would be $8bn better off between them than they were before the pandemic, the charity added.

Musk, according to figures taken from Forbes magazine’s billionaires list, saw his wealth increase 10-fold to $294bn in the first 20 months of the pandemic, catapulting him above Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, to be the world’s richest person.

Danny Sriskandarajah, the Oxfam GB chief executive said: “Even during a global crisis our unfair economic systems manage to deliver eye-watering windfalls for the wealthiest but fail to protect the poorest. It is an avoidable tragedy that every day people die because they lack essentials such as food and healthcare.

“Today’s generation of leaders can start to right these wrongs by implementing progressive taxes on capital and wealth and deploying that revenue to save lives and invest in our future.""

"“However good Healy’s intentions were, his apparent white saviour complex and performative activism mirror the post-colonial guilt that many white westerners seem to have when visiting countries once ruled by the British empire.”

Queer artist bones tan jones has criticised the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy for kissing his male bandmate on stage at Good Vibes festival in Malaysia.

Authorities cancelled the remainder of the three-day festival, with many people fearing a festival of this size won’t be allowed in the country for a while.

“Queer people in Malaysia can’t kiss someone of the same sex without risking being fined or flogged, so why can Matty Healy?” says jones.

The musicians and workers involved in the festival are now preparing a lawsuit against Matty Healy and the 1975 to seek damages from the cancellation.

And @yaya.bones believes that Matty Healy’s actions has made the situation worse for the Malaysian LGBTQ+ community rather than better.

In Malaysia, there are no LGBTQ+ rights, with a penalty of up to 20 years in prison for sodomy and Global Trans Rights Index ranks Malaysia as the second worst country in the world for transgender rights.

jones says they wish Healy had donated to the grassroots organisations that fight for LGBTQ+ rights in Malaysia, like Justice for Sisters who raise awareness about violence and persecution towards Mak Nyah (transgender women) in Malaysia.

“To Healy and his fans: if you want to actually help LGBTQ+ people in Malaysia, please consider funding the aforementioned organisations.”

"Does this term resonate with you?

For the first time ever, the 2022 Oxford word of the year has been decided by a public vote, and the winner is 'goblin mode'.

More than 340,000 English speakers, decided between a choice of three words (or phrases/hashtags given that 'word' is defined fairly loosely) narrowed down by lexicographers from Oxford University Press.

“Metaverse” was the second choice, followed by “#IStandWith”. Goblin mode was a landslide victory: it was selected by 318,956 people, making up 93% of the overall vote.

“Given the year we’ve just experienced, ‘goblin mode’ resonates with all of us who are feeling a little overwhelmed at this point”, the president of Oxford Languages, Casper Grathwohl said. “It’s a relief to acknowledge that we’re not always the idealised, curated selves that we’re encouraged to present on our Instagram and TikTok feeds.""

The hashtag #goblinmode on TikTok is often used as a rebuff of the “that girl” trend, which is all about being the “best version of yourself”, ie getting up early to exercise, performing elaborate skincare routines and drinking organic smoothies – and, of course, posting about all of this on social media.

The winning term was first seen on Twitter in 2009, but went viral in February 2022 after being tweeted in a mocked-up headline.

Goblin mode “embraces the comforts of depravity”, wrote our technology reporter @karipaul__ in March, who attributed the rise in the phrase’s usage to “the pandemic’s third year and the feared launch of World War Three”.

"This skull just forced scientists to rewrite the history of human evolution. 

Analysis of the remains has revealed a new branch of the human family tree that points to a previously unknown sister group more closely related to modern humans than the Neanderthals.

The extraordinary fossil has been named a new human species, Homo longi or “Dragon man”, by Chinese researchers, although other experts are more cautious about the designation.

“I think this is one of the most important finds of the past 50 years,” said Prof Chris Stringer, research leader at the Natural History Museum in London, who worked on the project. “It’s a wonderfully preserved fossil.”

The skull appears to have a remarkable backstory. According to the researchers, it was originally found in 1933 by Chinese labourers building a bridge over the Songhua River in Harbin, in China’s northernmost province, Heilongjiang, during the Japanese occupation. To keep the skull from falling into Japanese hands it was wrapped and hidden in an abandoned well, resurfacing only in 2018 after the man who hid it told his grandson about it shortly before he died.

"Giant pandas are no longer endangered in the wild, but they are still vulnerable with a population outside captivity of 1,800, Chinese officials have said after years of conservation efforts.

The head of the environment ministry’s department of nature and ecology conservation, Cui Shuhong, said the reclassification was the result of “improved living conditions and China’s efforts in keeping their habitats integrated”.

He said the announcement reflected China’s national efforts to preserve biodiversity in recent years. The authorities have worked to expand giant pandas’ habitats and replanted bamboo forests to feed them.

The number of Siberian tigers, amur leopards, Asian elephants and crested ibis have also “visibly increased” as a result of continuing conservation efforts in recent years, Cui told a press conference this week.

The decision by China’s own conservation authority comes five years after the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) removed giant pandas from its endangered species list and classified them as vulnerable.

This week’s announcement was met with delight on social media. Related hashtags on Weibo have been read nearly 10m times.

Pandas, however, still face long-term threats. IUCN has said climate change could destroy more than 35% of their bamboo habitat in the next 80 years.

"“Everything here was once beautiful.”

One year since Putin’s forces invaded Ukraine, local resident Vanya Firsov took our reporter through the ruins of a medical clinic in a small village outside Zaporizhzia.

“It had just been renovated,” he told our reporter, Luke Harding, as they picked their way through the rubble.

Once home to 1,000 people, Huliaipilske is now a ghostly wreck of wasted houses and destroyed agricultural land.

Now, only around 20 civilians remain in the village which hasn’t had electricity since last March. They are feeding the abandoned pets that were left behind, eyeing the Russian forces less than two miles away and keeping hope in the eventual victory of Ukraine.

“They’re hiding. Bastards. But our men will get them”, says Firsov.

"Climate activist Greta Thunberg has used an interview with a top style and culture magazine to call out fast fashion companies for “greenwashing”.

In an Instagram post to accompany her appearance on the cover of the first issue of Vogue Scandinavia, the 18-year-old spoke out about the contradiction between mass produced fashion and sustainability.

“Many are making it look as if the fashion industry are starting to take responsibility, by spending fantasy amounts on campaigns where they portray themselves as ‘sustainable’, ‘ethical’, ‘green’, ‘climate neutral’ and ‘fair’,” Thunberg wrote. “But let’s be clear: This is almost never anything but pure greenwashing.""

She also called out the fast fashion industry for being a huge contributor to the climate emergency as well as its impact on exploited workers and communities around the world.

Her interview with Vogue Scandinavia was published after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's damning report on Monday, which showed a critical global heating threshold of 1.5C may be breached far earlier than previously expected, potentially within a decade.

"How would you react to getting fired like this?

The chief executive of a US mortgage company has drawn criticism after he reportedly fired 900 employees on a Zoom call.

“I come to you with not great news,” Vishal Garg, CEO of Better.com, was heard saying at the beginning of the video call made on Wednesday last week. Footage of the call was widely circulated on social media.

“If you’re on this call, you are part of the unlucky group being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately,” Garg continued, citing changes in the market, “efficiency” and “productivity” as the reasons behind the mass termination.

“The market has changed … we have to move with it in order to survive,” the 43-year-old offered as explanation. “Ultimately it was my decision and I wanted you to hear it from me.”

He then reportedly said the employees could expect an email from HR with details of severance and benefits.

Garg, a self-described “serial entrepreneur”, said the decision was “really, really challenging” and noted it was the second time in his career he had made such job cuts.

One now-former employee described the call as “three minutes tops,” in an interview with The Daily Beast.

“They dumped us like trash. We were there since the beginning and worked hard for the company and for our roles,” another said.

The mortgage lender startup reportedly received a $750m (£564m) cash infusion from investors last week and was recently valued at around $7bn, according to Forbes.

Kevin Ryan, Better.com’s chief financial officer, was quoted as saying the company had laid off 9% of its employees after the call.

"""Nurses are fighting for my life, and for your life, like they have always done. So I will join them on the picket line as they demand the pay rise they deserve.""

Melanie Duddridge has Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia and chronic asthma. She relies on the NHS every day – that’s why she says she is supporting striking nurses across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Today marks the second day of strikes in December, after an initial strike last week, the biggest in the Royal College of Nursing's history.

It meant the cancellation of thousands of outpatient appointments and non-urgent operations.

The RNC has said that low pay is the cause of chronic understaffing that is putting patients at risk and leaves NHS staff overworked.

Ahead of the first strike, Duddridge wrote: ""I know the strikes might affect my care in the weeks to come, but this action is needed to keep patients like me safe. Nurses aren’t just going on strike for themselves, they are striking to preserve the NHS for all of us.""

"Australia's government has been on a global lobbying campaign to prevent the UN from listing the Great Barrier Reef as ""in danger"".

It comes as the 21-country world heritage committee is meeting in China to decide whether to change the reef’s world heritage status after global heating caused mass coral bleaching in 2016, 2017 and 2020.

Their decision that is expected tomorrow - though Australia's Paris-based ambassador to @unesco, Megan Anderson, has said she believed Scott Morrison's government had won enough support to delay the decision until at least 2023.

An international line-up of actors, conservationists and scientists, including Joanna Lumley (@joannalumleyuk) and Jason Momoa (@Jprideofgypsies) have all backed calls for the planet's largest coral reef system to be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger.

"Magic mushrooms show promise in treatment for depression, according to new trials.

The results from a small, phase two clinical trial have revealed that two doses of their active ingredient, psilocybin, appears to be as effective as the common antidepressant escitalopram in treating moderate to severe major depressive disorder, at least when combined with psychological therapy.

“I think it is fair to say that the results signal hope that we may be looking at a promising alternative treatment for depression,” said Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, head of the centre for psychedelic research at Imperial College London and a co-author of the study.

Carhart-Harris said psilocybin was thought to work in a fundamentally different way to escitalopram. While both act on the brain’s serotonin system, he said escitalopram seemed to work by helping people tolerate stress more easily.

However, Carhart-Harris cautioned against seeking out magic mushrooms – a class A drug in the UK – for DIY treatment.

"The House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack has played video of Donald Trump saying, ‘I don’t want to say the election is over’ in an outtake for a pre-recorded address the day after the insurrection. 

The video showed Trump recording a speech and arguing with aides, including his daughter Ivanka, over lines he was reading from the teleprompter. 'But this election is now over. Congress has certified the results,' Trump read, before saying: 'I don’t want to say the election’s over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results, without saying the election’s over, OK?'

It was a big night for revelations by the January 6 committee, which described in more detail than has been known in the past what Donald Trump was doing as the Capitol was attacked.

The committee will have its next public hearings in September, and appears particularly interested in what the Secret Service knows about that day.

"When the Canadian comedian Norm Macdonald, who has passed away aged 61, wasn't spinning out hilarious yarns, he was often delighting crowds with his incisive observations, dad jokes, and one-liners.

If you haven't watched some of the long, side-splitting stories he told on talk shows, or seen the glint in his eye as he prepared to make a hilariously awkward remark, then you may want to head to YouTube when you can.

It was always hard to tell when Macdonald was being serious and when he was joking, even when talking about illness and death. But often the line between sincerity and humour were naturally blurred, with Macdonald's candid perspective on the world and gift for comedy two inseparable parts of his personality and appeal.

""I am absolutely devastated about Norm Macdonald,"" tweeted Conan O'Brien, whose talk show Macdonald regularly appeared on. ""Norm had the most unique comedic voice I have ever encountered and he was so relentlessly and uncompromisingly funny. I will never laugh that hard again. I'm so sad for all of us today.""

"How would you feel if you were suddenly a year younger?

South Korea has passed laws to scrap its traditional method of counting ages – a shift that will make its citizens either one or two years younger on official documents.

South Koreans are deemed to be a year old when they are born, and a year is added every 1 January. The unusual – and increasingly unpopular – custom means a baby born on New Year’s Eve becomes two years old as soon as the clock strikes midnight.

However, a separate system also exists for conscription purposes or calculating the legal age to drink alcohol and smoke, in which a person’s age is calculated from zero at birth and a year is added on 1 January.

On top of this, for medical and legal documents South Korea uses the international standard of measuring age, where someone is zero at their birth and turns a year older on their birthday.

The confusing array of systems will disappear from June 2023 – at least on official documents.

“The revision is aimed at reducing unnecessary socio-economic costs because legal and social disputes as well as confusion persist due to the different ways of calculating age,” Yoo Sang-bum of the ruling People Power party told parliament.

Jeong Da-eun, a 29-year-old office worker, is happy about the change, and says she has always had to think twice when asked overseas about her age.

“Who wouldn’t welcome getting a year or two younger?” she added.

"""For a long time I felt I deserved my lot, until I discovered that so many of my fellow care leavers suffered similar outcomes.”

The Guardian's Daniel Lavelle grew up in care, and spent some time homeless. Now a journalist and an author, he says he's somewhat of an anomaly - statistics show one in four people who leave the care system in the UK end up homeless, and are also likely to end up in prison.

Lavelle has now been on a journey to reconnect with those who were in the system with him 20 years ago and to speak to those who have just left to learn about their experiences - and to see if after a decade of austerity what has changed for some of the country’s most vulnerable children.

"“What we have here is just a crazy system"" 💧

England is one of the few countries in the world where water is fully owned by private companies. These companies answer to investors based thousands of miles away from their customers.

“We are managing our water in the interests of offshore investors,"" said Kate Bayliss, from the department of economics at SOAS University of London and author of several papers on England’s privatised water.

These offshore investors include private and state-owned international funds, banks, multinationals and billionaires headquartered outside the UK, and they control at least 72% of English water, new Guardian research has found.

"Who's Colin you ask? He's a British cult classic chocolate cake from the supermarket Marks and Spencer - and a caterpillar who has found himself at the centre of a court case.

It's being billed as the ultimate food fight: Colin the Caterpillar is going to war with lookalike Cuthbert from Aldi supermarket.

With their hard chocolate shells decorated with sweeties and white chocolate grinning faces, it is difficult to tell Colin and Cuthbert apart ... but it's Colin (on the right of the picture above) who's the OG caterpillar cake.

M&S argues the similarities mean consumers think they are of the same standard, enabling its cheaper rival – Cuthbert costs £5 while Colin is £7 – to “ride on the coat-tails” of the company’s reputation for high-quality food.

Colin the Caterpillar made his debut in 1990 and, with more than 15m cake sales under his belt has, much like Rihanna, has become known to fans by just his first name.

M&S wants Aldi to remove Cuthbert from its shelves and agree not to sell anything similar in the future.

"What responsibility do you think the producers of takeaway packaging have?

The most comprehensive study ever done has found plastic items from our takeaway food and drink are the most widespread items polluting the seas.

Single-use bags, plastic bottles, food containers and food wrappers are the four most predominant items contaminating the ocean, making up almost half of the human-made waste, the researchers found.

Just 10 plastic products make up 75% of all ocean litter. This includes fishing gear, synthetic rope, industrial packaging, plastic lids, drinks cans, and glass bottles.

The scientists said identifying the key sources of ocean plastic made it clear where action was needed. They called for bans on some common throwaway items and for producers to be made to take more responsibility.

Action on plastic straws and cotton buds in Europe was welcome, the researchers said, but risked being a distraction from tackling far more common types of litter.

""We were not surprised about plastic being 80% of the litter, but the high proportion of takeaway items did surprise us, which will not just be McDonald’s litter, but water bottles, beverage bottles like Coca-Cola, and cans,” said Carmen Morales-Caselles, at the University of Cádiz, Spain, who led the new research.

"Kiyan Prince was once the most promising talent in the Queens Park Rangers’ football academy.

He would have been 30 this year, but in 2006 he died at the gates of his school in north London. In a notorious incident Prince was stabbed in the heart with a penknife as he tried to break up a fight.

The killer, who called the knife a “little toy”, was 16.

Now, 15 years later, the life and legacy of Kiyan Prince is to be commemorated with his addition to EA Sports’ blockbuster video game, Fifa 21.

He is also being given his own squad number by QPR, 30, a move that follows a decision by the club’s supporters two years ago to rename their stadium after the foundation that bears Prince’s name, a charity dedicated to persuading young, disenfranchised people to stay away from knives.

Since his son was murdered, Dr Mark Prince has dedicated his life to @thekpf. He says that while Kiyan's death has never got less painful, the inspiration that comes from his son's life is what keeps him going.

“Even when he dies he can’t be forgotten,” he says, “because he lived for something and he cared about people. He’s a living example for all young people, he’s the model for them to follow.”

"Before you swipe across ... how much do you think the price of gas has risen by? And how about bread and butter? 🍞🧈

Last month, inflation returned again to double digits, hitting 10.1%. Soaring prices for food and drink were the biggest driver behind the increase, with an annual rise of almost 15%, the fastest annual jump for more than 42 years, the latest figures show.

The Office for National Statistics compiled the overall figure using the consumer prices index but also logs the increasing prices of individual goods and services. Here we break down how those everyday items have shot up over the past year.

In each case, the figure is the percentage change in the average price over the 12 months to September 2022, and on many occasions the rate has risen to an even higher level than in August.

"“These objects are not just a record of colonial oppression and historic crimes but, to many, the thing itself perpetuated”

As many as 2,000 historic items are thought to have gone missing from the British Museum’s collection, it emerged last month.

The museum houses some of the most important historical objects – not just from the UK, but from communities around the world. Its exhibits include contested treasures, sacred artefacts and even human remains. 

Now that hundreds of items have been found to be missing, serious damage has been done to the museum’s reputation, giving fresh momentum to arguments for the return of objects – such as the Parthenon marbles, Benin bronzes and Ethiopian tabots – to their original homes.

The cancellation was announced by the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, on Monday and followed a decision by Endemol Shine Australia to cancel her contract to appear on Seven Network’s Big Brother VIP.

New South Wales police in a statement said Hopkins had been fined $1,000 for allegedly failing to wear a mask. The force said it had assisted immigration authorities to deport her on Monday afternoon to the United Kingdom.

"""I always think about the young boy who wanted nothing more than to understand he had a place in this world, that he was OK.""

The US politician Rufus Gifford has posted a moving Twitter thread explaining his disappointment after the Florida governor signed the controversial “Don’t say gay” bill into law yesterday.

The policy has drawn intense national scrutiny from critics who argue it risks marginalising LGBTQ+ people.

The bill forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through to third grade.

After that, these topics must be “age-appropriate”. However, the law does not define this term and there are fears it is so vaguely worded that speech could be muzzled in public schools.

Parents will be able to sue school districts over any violations.

Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, and Republicans say the bill is reasonable. They argue that parents, not teachers, should broach subjects of sexual orientation and gender identity with children.

President Joe Biden hit back: “Our LGBTQI+ youth deserve to be affirmed and accepted just as they are.”

Florida is the first US state to pass the bill but others are considering similar laws, including Georgia, Tennessee, Indiana, Oklahoma and Kansas.

These tweets share a personal account by @rufusgifford , the chief of protocol of the US and an openly gay politician. The former US ambassador has explained how life-changing positive LGBTQ+ representation would have been when he was younger.

"Which alt-milk do you think is the most popular?

New research suggests that one in three people in Britain are now choosing plant-based milk alternatives - with analysts saying the uptake is being driven by environmental and health considerations.

Shoppers spent £100m more in 2020 on alt-milks, made from oats, almonds or soya, turning it into a near £400m-a-year market.

The findings, from Mintel, said 32% of those polled drank plant-based milk, which was up from 25% in 2020 - and it is even higher among 25- to 44-year-olds at 44%.

A quarter of the 2,000 people who took part in the research also said the pandemic had made eating vegan or plant-based food and drink more appealing to them. For the under-35s that figure rose to 38%.

The report also revealed that oat milk had become the plant-based milk of choice, overtaking almond to become the biggest seller in 2020.

The average person’s milk consumption in the UK has fallen 50% since the 1950s, however it soared on the back of pandemic lifestyle changes, with sales up by £100m to £3.2bn.

According to a 2018 study, a glass of dairy milk produces almost three times more greenhouse gas than any plant-based milk. But vegan options have drawbacks of their own ... so what milk should we drink?

New research suggests that one in three people in Britain are now choosing plantbased milk alternatives  with analysts saying the uptake is being driven by environmental and health considerations

Shoppers spent 100m more in 2020 on altmilks made from oats almonds or soya turning it into a near 400mayear market

The findings from Mintel said 32 of those polled drank plantbased milk which was up from 25 in 2020  and it is even higher among 25 to 44yearolds at 44

A quarter of the 2000 people who took part in the research also said the pandemic had made eating vegan or plantbased food and drink more appealing to them For the under35s that figure rose to 38

The report also revealed that oat milk had become the plantbased milk of choice overtaking almond to become the biggest seller in 2020

"When life gives you memes ...

Zoë Roth, the woman whose picture was central to the 2005 Disaster Girl meme, has sold the original photo for $473,000 – the latest addition to the cryptocurrency-linked, digital image NFT craze that is sweeping through the art market.

The image was taken of Roth, then aged four, by her father in front of a burning house in Mebane, North Carolina. Firefighters had intentionally set the blaze as a controlled fire.

Roth, now aged 21 and a university student, sold the image through Ben Lashes, an NFT, or non-fungible token, entrepreneur who has racked up about $2m in sales for sales including Nyan Cat, Grumpy Cat, Keyboard Cat, Doge, Success Kid and David After Dentist.

Roth, who says she plans to use the proceeds to pay off her student loans and donate additional money to charity, told the New York Times: “The internet is big. Whether you’re having a good experience or a bad experience, you kind of just have to make the most of it.”

She told the Raleigh News & Observer: “Nobody who is a meme tried to do that, it just ended up that way. Is it luck? Is it fate? I have no idea. But I will take it.”

"Who would be your choice for person of the year?

Times magazine have gone for a highly controversial choice and given the accolade to Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, describing him as a “clown, genius, edgelord, visionary, industrialist and showman.""

But the decision has drawn sharp criticism because of Musk's attitude to tax, opposition to unions and playing down the dangers of Covid-19.

Musk, who is also the founder and chief executive of space exploration company SpaceX, recently passed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the world’s wealthiest person after his net worth rose to around $300bn.

Time has defended its choice, explaining that its annual acknowledgment was not an award, but rather, “recognition of the person who had the most influence on the events of the year, for good or for ill”.

The title has previously been bestowed to popes, Ebola healthcare workers and Greta Thunberg but also Hitler and Stalin, who received it twice. In 1982, it went to “The Computer”. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were Time magazine’s person – or persons – of the year for 2020.

"This is the elephant in the room ... literally.

Ratchadawan Puengprasoppon was awoken in the early hours of Saturday morning by crashing and banging in her house in Thailand.

She discovered an elephant’s head poking through her kitchen wall beside the drying rack.

The male elephant, named Boonchuay, was rummaging through the kitchen drawers, knocking pans to the floor.

This isn't uncommon. “They come to visit quite often. They always come when there is the local market because they can smell food,” said Itthipon Thaimonkol, the park’s superintendent.

Dr Joshua Plotnik, an assistant professor of psychology at Hunter College, City University of New York, who studies the elephant population in the Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand, said: “In the villages in which I work in Thailand, elephants enter farmers’ cropfields almost nightly. This is a really difficult issue for both the farmers and the elephants.""

In China recently there was the story of a herd of elephants that travelled for 15 months far away from their natural habitat, eating entire fields of corn and destroying barns along the way.

“These incidences are increasing in Asia, and it is likely due to a decrease in available resources and an increase in human disturbances in the elephants’ habitat,” said Plotnik.

“If you don’t fulfil the elephants’ need for food, water and other resources in their natural habitat (or ensure they have them somewhere else), they will find ways around deterrents and access villages or cropfields in search of these resources.”

"New Zealand’s rare, highly endangered alpine parrots may have headed for the mountains to avoid people.

The kea - an alpine parrot - is thought to be the only parrot to live in the mountains, but scientists analysing DNA sequencing and fossil records have found the species were once present in other parts of the country.

The news is something of a knock to the kea’s internationally unique “alpine parrot” status. But it may also be a saving grace for the endangered bird, making it more capable of surviving habitat loss or increased competition.

Being an alpine specialist can make species like kea particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis. Research from Europe has found up to 22% of species studied on glaciers in the Italian Alps would disappear from the area once the glaciers had gone.

Associate professor Michael Knapp, one of the paper’s lead authors, said the idea that kea had moved specifically to avoid people was still speculative. But given kea were physically able to survive in a variety of habitats, it made sense to examine what the primary differences were.

"This brings new meaning to the phrase 'neighbourhood, watch ...'

This tree - which was cleaved in half - has become an attraction in a residential part of South Yorkshire after a dispute between neighbours.

Bharat Mistry, 56, said he had been embroiled in a year-long dispute with the family next door over birds roosting in the tree, which they said generated too much noise and mess in the drive of their bungalow.

Their next-door neighbours then asked tree surgeons to cut down half the branches of the 5 metre conifer tree that had stood in his garden in the Sheffield suburb of Waterthorpe for 25 years.

Without Mistry’s knowledge, an image of the tree was posted on Reddit with the title: “Some traditional British pettiness on display.” The image and account have since been deleted, but not before going viral. One user on Twitter wrote: ""This is the pettiest thing I have ever seen and I love it.""

Mistry said he had trimmed the tree into a ball shape, which his neighbour had agreed with until birds began roosting in the tree. He said their relations had previously been amicable and he had trimmed the branches lower down the tree to make space for the neighbours’ car.

Mistry, who lives in a three-bedroom property with his wife and two daughters, asked the neighbours not to have the branches removed, but acknowledged they were entitled to do so as the tree protruded by a metre on to their property.

The neighbours have refused requests to comment.

One woman who wished to remain anonymous said: “When I saw it, I just thought: ‘Oh my God, what a shame.’ It’s a lovely tree and adds to the feature of the house and the street.” Another neighbour who did not want to be named said: “It ruins the visual aspect for everyone.”

"Caster Semenya should be angry, but she isn’t. As the clock ticks down towards the Tokyo Olympics, the South African should, like her rivals, be training for the push to land a third consecutive gold medal.

Instead, the 30-year-old, who has fought a wave of prejudice and stigma throughout her life, is forlornly waiting on news from the European court of human rights (ECHR), which, in turn, could convince World Athletics that being asked to take medication is perhaps not the most humane way of dealing with a woman who has a congenital condition some believe hands her an unfair advantage.

@castersemenya800m's “crime” – apart from dominating on the track – is that she is an athlete with differences in sex development, a condition that leads to elevated levels of testosterone in the body.

"“It’s been a really terrible night for us”.

This is what Conservative minister Johnny Mercer said to the BBC while Plymouth Council was called for Labour in the background live on air.

“I think, locally, it has been very difficult … and we have seen that reflected in the results tonight but you know, we take it on the chin,” said the MP.

The local elections have seen a ‘disappointing’ night for Tories as Labour, which is course to take the lead in the total number of councillors for the first time in 20 years, make big gains in key England councils – though the Liberal Democrats are also playing a key role in the Conservative decline.

“These results have been a disaster for Rishi Sunak as voters punish him for the Tories’ failure”, said Shabana Mahmood, Labour’s campaign chief.

Greg Hands, the Conservative party chair, told GB News that it has been a ‘disappointing’ night for his party.

Labour claims its English local election gains put it ‘on course’ for winning the next general election although the party is currently projected to fall short of the 10-point lead experts said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, would need to feel confident of becoming the next prime minister.
