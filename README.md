# NLP Final Project

This repository contains the final project for the NLP course. The project explores various Natural Language Processing techniques, including tokenization, lemmatization, Tf-IDF, Word2Vec, and autoencoders.

## Project Structure

- **Installation of Packages:** The project begins with the installation of the necessary Python packages for NLP.
- **Part 2 - Tokenization, Lemmatization & Stop Words Removal:** 
  - This section covers the process of tokenizing and lemmatizing the text data. 
  - Stop words are removed to focus on the most significant words in the dataset.
  - The processed text is saved into a new file.
- **Part 3 - Tf-IDF:** 
  - Implementation of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-IDF) to convert the text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
- **Word2Vec:** 
  - Utilizes the Word2Vec model to create word embeddings from the text data, capturing the semantic meaning of words.
- **Part 5 - Autoencoder:** 
  - This section involves the use of an autoencoder, a type of neural network, for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction from the text data.
