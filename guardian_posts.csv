"At Kamala Harris’s first rally since announcing Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate, the room at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was ebullient, filled with thousands of voters cheering and waving Harris-Walz signs.

Voters at the Tuesday rally were split in their opinions about Harris’s decision to pass over Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor who was on the shortlist of vice-presidential candidates. Still, they reaffirmed their vow to support Harris and to ensure that Trump isn’t elected again.

Comparing Walz’s resume to that of JD Vance, Harris said, “Well some might say it’s like, a match-up between the varsity team and the JV squad.”

"Presumptive Democratic nominee Kamala Harris has chosen the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, as her running mate in the presidential race, elevating a popular although relatively unknown leader who has attracted the support of progressive voters in recent days.

Walz recently captured the internet’s attention and swayed Democrats’ messaging by succinctly summing up how he views Republicans: they’re weird.

But it’s not just the “weird” of it all: he’s been able to run through a list of what Democrats want, and what he’s done as governor during a banner time for Democrats in his state, that articulates to voters what they would be voting for – not just the danger of what they’re voting against. He speaks plainly and pragmatically, showing the commonsense policies his party stands for.

“Tim’s just a freaking down-home guy,” said Tim Ryan, a former Democratic US representative from Ohio who worked with Walz.

Ryan called to mind a recent clip in which Walz mentioned that Minnesota ranked in the top three for happiest states in the nation. “Isn’t that really the goal here? For some joy? When he mentioned that, I was like, dang man, that’s really good. That’s really good, because it gets us out of the political space and into the human being space.”

"‘It can destroy people,’ says Imane Khelif, an Algerian boxer in the centre of an Olympics gender eligibility row has called for an end to “bullying” as she continues to face hostility over her participation in the Games.

Khelif and the Chinese Taipei fighter Lin Yu-ting have come under intense scrutiny in Paris 2024. Both fighters competed without incident at Tokyo 2020, but were disqualified from last year’s world championships at a late stage by the International Boxing Association (IBA) for failing to meet its gender eligibility criteria.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has cast doubts on the tests taken, calling the disqualifications “arbitrary”, while the IOC president Thomas Bach said the boxers had been subjected to “hate speech”.

The two athletes’ presence became headline news after the Italian boxer Angela Carini abandoned her bout against Khelif after 46 seconds of the fight, claiming she had never been hit harder.

Imane Khelif, who is assured of at least a bronze medal ahead of her next bout on Tuesday, said she hoped that a gold medal would come out of the pain she had endured over the past week.

"Kamala Harris has named Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, as her running mate ahead of the November election.

The decision ends intense speculation over which candidate Harris would pick to go up against Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and former president, and his choice for vice-president, Ohio senator JD Vance.

The Minnesota governor captured the internet’s attention and swayed Democrats’ messaging by succinctly summing up how he views Republicans: they’re weird.

Some political commentators had suggested that, as the first woman of color nominated by a major party, Harris was mostly likely to pick a white man to balance the ticket.

Walz, 60, was born and raised in small-town Nebraska. He became a teacher, first in China, then in Nebraska and finally in Mankato, Minnesota, where he taught geography and coached the high school football team. He was the faculty adviser for the school’s first gay-straight alliance chapter in 1999, long before Democrats nationally stood for gay rights.

Kamala Harris will formally introduce Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate at a rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, later today.

"The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has warned “far-right thugs” that they will regret any role in rioting, after violent anti-immigration protests spread through multiple cities in England and in Belfast at the weekend.

These clashes were met by even larger counter-protests in many areas, with residents in Middlesbrough, Sunderland and other locations uniting to help clean up after a trail of destruction.

At least 247 related arrests were made at the weekend in England and Northern Ireland. The violence is the worst mass disorder since the 2011 riots across England.

The far-right marches took place after a knife attack in Southport, where three girls were killed and 10 people injured after a 17-year-old boy attacked a Taylor Swift-themed dance class.

A flood of disinformation about the Southport stabbings has been spread on social media by sources ranging from far-right activists to fake news websites and conspiracy theorists, leading to a far-right attack on a mosque in the town shortly after.

Starmer has said a “standing army” of specialist police officers would be set up to quell the rioting and unrest, according to the PA news agency.

A senior adviser on extremism to Conservative prime ministers has suggested the Tory government left the UK wide open to far-right violence erupting across parts of the country by ignoring red flags and stoking a culture war agenda.

The Police Federation of England and Wales said the clashes were 'flooding across major cities and towns' and warned that further violence was likely in the coming days.

"The prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, has resigned and left the country, the head of the army has confirmed, amid some of the worst violence since the birth of the south Asian country more than 50 years ago.

In a briefing to reporters, Army Chief Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman announced he was assuming control at “a critical time for our country” and would establish an interim government.

“I am taking responsibility now and we will go to the president and ask to form an interim government to lead the country in the meantime.”

Hasina, 76, who has ruled Bangladesh since 2009, left by helicopter, a source close to the leader told Agence France-Presse news agency shortly after protesters had stormed her palace in the capital, Dhaka.

"Before the war, 32-year-old Hamada Shaqoura was a food blogger covering the best of Gaza’s vibrant food scene.

Now, forced to flee his home to southern Gaza, and as the hunger and displacement crisis in the territory increases, he makes meals out of aid rations to feed and bring joy to people living in refugee camps – especially children.

Since Israel’s invasion of Gaza after Hamas’s 7 October attack, and the intensification of its 17-year-blockade of the strip, nearly half a million people in Gaza are facing starvation, according to a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.

A group of independent UN human rights experts have also warned “there is no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza”, after the recent deaths of several children due to malnutrition.

“No matter how much I cook, people need more,” says @hamadashoo who currently lives in Khan Younis, having fled Rafah after Israel began its ground invasion in May. His first child was born there shortly after.

“I use food to portray the suffering of our people,” says Shaqoura, who says he uses his Instagram account, where he posts videos of himself cooking and handing out food, to encourage people to raise awareness of the hunger in Gaza.

“I want my son to have a better life and not see such days again,” he says.

"PFAS are a class of about 15,000 compounds typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate, and are linked to cancer, immune disorders, and other serious health problems.

In recent years, research has found or pointed to the presence of toxic PFAS in a range of staples, products and beverages across the food system that makes it difficult to know what is safe to eat and what is not.

So, how can you avoid PFAS in your diet? The simple answer is: you can’t, not completely.

That’s because the contamination happens before you ever step foot in a grocery store. The FDA does not have limits in place on PFAS in food.

Among the most serious concerns of contamination is sewage sludge, which is used as a cheap alternative to fertilizer on cropland as well as the water used on crops or for livestock, all things that are out of the consumer’s control.

However, there are some steps you can take to reduce your exposure and protect your health.

"“Justice has finally arrived,” says Pjotr Sauer, the Guardian’s Russian affairs correspondent, after his good friend Evan Gershkovich was released after more than 16 months in Russian prison.

Gershkovich was on a reporting trip deep in the Russian regions when the FSB came for him. The Wall Street Journal reporter was in Yekaterinburg, more than 850 miles from the Russian capital, when agents approached his table at a local bistro. As they frog-marched him out of the restaurant, the officers pulled Gershkovich’s shirt over his head to obscure his identity, witnesses said. The signal was clear: this was no ordinary arrest.

Gershkovich was the first reporter to be charged with espionage since the cold war, and Putin barely hid his aim to use the journalist in a prisoner swap with the west.

After 500 days in jail, on Thursday evening Gershkovich was finally released. We spoke to @pjotrsauer about his reaction to his friend’s release.

"Simone Biles has won her sixth Olympic gold medal, and her second of the Paris Games, capturing the women’s all-around final for a second time.

The 27-year-old returned to the summit of world gymnastics eight years after winning her first Olympic all-around title in Rio, becoming only the third woman in history to earn the sport’s most prestigious title more than once, after Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union (1956 and 1960) and Vera Caslavska of Czechoslovakia (1964 and 1968).

Biles also became the oldest women’s all-around Olympic champion since the Soviet Union’s Maria Gorokhovskaya, who won the gold in 1952 when she was 30. She also becomes the sixth straight American woman to win the title.

The historic gold marked her 39th career medal between the Olympics and world championships, extending her record as the most decorated gymnast in history. Since winning her first national title in 2013, she has won every all-around competition in every meet she has entered.

"“It’s not the first time we are doing this [reporting the deaths of colleagues] but every time it feels as if it’s the first time.”

This is what Hind Khoudary, a Palestinian journalist in Gaza working for Al Jazeera said after learning of the death of her colleagues Ismail al-Ghoul andcamera operator Rami al-Rifi after an Israeli strike hit their car in northern Gaza.

Al Jazeera said Ghoul and Rifi were in the al-Shati refugee camp reporting from near the house of the Hamas political chief, Ismail Haniyeh, who had been killed in an Israeli strike hours earlier.

The journalists were wearing press vests and Al Jazeera says their car was clearly marked as a press vehicle. Footage from the ground shows a white car completely destroyed.

Khoudary described how “heartbreaking” it was to have to report on the deaths of her Al-Jazeera colleagues, which include the camera operator Samer Abu Daqqa and journalist Hamza Wael Dahdouh, who were killed in separate Israeli airstrikes in December and January.

Authorities in Gaza say 165 Palestinian journalists have been killed since 7 October.

Khoudary also referenced the killing of Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in the West Bank in 2022. A joint investigation by Forensic Architecture and Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq found evidence that an Israeli sniper repeatedly shot at Akleh and that her killing was deliberate.

Israel initially blamed the Al Jazeera reporter’s death on Palestinian militants, but after widespread international outrage later said there was a “high possibility” she was killed by an Israeli soldier. 

The IDF maintains the shooting was accidental, and therefore a criminal investigation is not warranted.

"During a contentious panel hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ), Donald Trump repeated misinformation and questioned Kamala Harris’s race.

He also accused a panel moderator, Rachel Scott – the senior congressional correspondent for ABC News – of being “rude” and posing a “nasty question” when she asked him: “Why should Black voters trust you?”

There was a mixed reaction among journalists in the room.

At least two Black attenders sporting Trump hats frequently cheered for the former president, especially when he claimed that he had faced “political persecution” after facing 34 felon charges.

Others were critical. “Ultimately, the conversation was a non-starter,” said Michael Liptrot, South Side Weekly reporter. “The moderators did their best to lead a productive conversation and dive deeper and, ultimately, attempts to flip the question led to a stalemate in many ways.”

"Almost half of dementia cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed, a study has found, with leading experts naming 14 risk factors.

The number of people living with dementia globally is forecast to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050, and researchers warn this presents a rapidly growing threat to health and social care systems.

However, in a seismic report published by the Lancet, 27 of the world’s leading dementia experts concluded that far more cases could be avoided or delayed than previously thought.

Addressing 14 modifiable risk factors, starting in childhood and continuing throughout life, could prevent or delay 45% of dementia cases, even as people live longer, the Lancet commission on dementia said.

“Many people around the world believe dementia is inevitable but it’s not,” said lead author of the research, Prof Gill Livingston. “It’s never too early or too late to take action.”

The report adds two risk factors that are associated with 9% of dementia cases. About 7% of cases are linked to “bad” cholesterol in midlife from about the age of 40, while 2% of cases are attributable to untreated vision loss in later life.

These new risk factors are in addition to 12 identified by the Lancet commission in 2020: lower levels of education, hearing impairment, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, depression, physical inactivity, diabetes, excessive alcohol consumption; traumatic brain injury, air pollution and social isolation.

"Southport rioters will feel “full force of the law”, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has said.

It came after far-right protesters pelted police with glass bottles and bricks and attacked a mosque following a knife attack that killed three children.

Starmer said the rioters had “hijacked the vigil for the victims with violence and thuggery” and “insulted the community as it grieves”.

Thirty-nine police officers sustained injuries, North West ambulance service said, with 27 of them taken to hospital. Merseyside police said eight officers suffered serious injuries including fractures, lacerations, a suspected broken nose and a concussion. Other officers suffered head injuries and serious facial injuries, and one was knocked unconscious.

This came after misinformation about the Southport knife attack suspect spread on social media as far-right activists and conspiracy theorists shared content.

The only details released about the suspect by police are that he is a 17-year-old from the village of Banks in Lancashire, who was born in the UK.

The UK’s home secretary, Yvette Cooper, urged the public to avoid “unhelpful” speculation about the attack, saying social media companies “need to take some responsibility” for the content being shared on their sites.

"“We are tired,“ said 23-year-old protester Hemgerly Serrano, as thousands took to the streets in Venezuela to demonstrate against the result of the country’s presidential election in which Nicolás Maduro was declared the winner, despite exit polls pointing to an opposition win.

After a six-hour delay in releasing the results of Sunday’s poll prompted international concern, Venezuela’s electoral council claimed Maduro had won with 51.21% of votes compared with 44.2% for his rival, Edmundo González Urrutia, a former diplomat.

Independent observers had described the election as the most arbitrary in recent years, even by the standards of an authoritarian regime that started with Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chávez.

Reuters reported that Edison Research published an exit poll showing González Urrutia had won 65% of the vote, while Maduro won 31%.

Maduro, a 61-year-old former union leader and foreign minister, was narrowly elected in 2013, after the death of Chávez; his 2018 re-election was widely dismissed as a sham. At a rally in this year’s election, he warned of a “bloodbath” if he lost to González Urrutia.

He has presided over an economic collapse, mass migration, and deteriorating relations with the west, including US and EU sanctions that have crippled an already struggling oil industry.

International leaders expressed concern about the results.

“Maduro's regime must understand that the results are hard to believe,” said Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric.

“The international community and especially the Venezuelan people, including the millions of Venezuelans in exile, demand total transparency ... we will not recognise any result that is not verifiable.”

"On a distant reef 16,000km from Paris, surfer Gabriel Medina has given Olympic viewers one of the most memorable images of the Games yet, with an airborne celebration so well poised it looked too good to be true.

The Brazilian took off a thundering wave at Teahupo’o in Tahiti on Monday, emerging from a barrelling section before soaring into the air and appearing to settle on a Pacific cloud, pointing to the sky with biblical serenity, his movements mirrored precisely by his surfboard.

The shot was taken by Agence France-Presse photographer @jeromebrouilletphotography, who said ‘the conditions were perfect, the waves were taller than we expected’. He took the photo while aboard a boat nearby, capturing the surreal image with such accuracy that at first some suspected Photoshop or AI.

‘So he [Medina] is at the back of the wave and I can’t see him and then he pops up and I took four pictures and one of them was this one,’ said Brouillet. ‘It was not hard to take the picture. It was more about anticipating the moment and where Gabriel will kick off the wave.‘

But Brouillet had knowledge and experience on his side – he could see one of the best waves of the day was approaching and knew that Medina often does this kind of celebration at the end of the wave.

‘It’s very cool, it’s a nice shot and lots of people love it. It’s not really a surf photograph so it captures the attention of more people.’

"Israeli drones struck a remote road in southern Lebanon, as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, promised a “harsh” response to the rocket strike on the occupied Golan Heights that killed 12 children.

Two Israeli drone strikes killed two people, according to Lebanon’s state news agency, as well as wounding three others on the roads between the towns of Chaqra and Meiss El Jabal, close to the frontier between Israel and Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it shot down a drone sent from Lebanese territory in the early hours of the morning, intercepting the aircraft after it crossed into Israeli territory.

Tensions between Israel and Lebanon have risen in recent days after the rocket strike on the town of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, annexed by Israel in 1981, which killed 12 children as they played football on Saturday.

Israeli and US officials blamed Hezbollah for the missile strike, which the Lebanese militant group has denied.

Netanyahu flew back early from a trip to the US and spent Sunday in discussion with military security officials. He later convened his security cabinet for several hours to discuss how to respond to the strike on Majdal Shams, amid pressure from the US and France to avoid a large-scale attack that risks sparking a regional war.

"Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit and address to a joint session of the US Congress on Wednesday was met with a personal protest in the chamber by the sole Palestinian American member of Congress.

The Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib, a leading progressive Democrat and fiercely outspoken opponent of Israel’s war in Gaza, held up a sign that said “war criminal” as Netanyahu was speaking. She also wore a Palestinian flag pin and a keffiyeh, the black and white scarf that has been linked with the Palestinian struggle for over half a century.

While some lawmakers gave the Israeli prime minister a standing ovation, others stayed away, and demonstrations by thousands of protesters took place outside.

After Netanyahu’s speech Tlaib posted on X: ‘I will never back down in speaking truth to power.’

Dozens of Democratic members of Congress – including the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi – said they would boycott the speech over humanitarian concerns about how Israel has prosecuted the war in Gaza, which has left an estimated 39,000 Palestinian civilians dead.

"“I want justice for my baby,” said James Wilburn, the father of Sonya Massey, a 36-year-old Black woman who was shot in the face and killed by a white sheriff’s deputy in Illinois.

Sonya Massey was killed early on the morning of 6 July by Sean Grayson, an Illinois sheriff’s deputy, in her home in Springfield, the Illinois state capitol.

Newly released body-cam footage shows a police officer shooting Massey – who called police in fear of a home intruder – in the face, killing her.

The family of Massey have said police initially tried to cover up her killing.

At a press conference on Tuesday, the family said police initially told Massey’s loved ones she had either killed herself or was killed by an intruder.

“They tried to make me believe that a neighbor had did it,” said Jimmie Crawford Jr, Massey’s former partner and the father of one of her children, who added that law enforcement told nurses at the hospital that Massey had “killed herself”. “How do you get that confused?” said Crawford Jr.

Only after a doctor said Massey’s death was a homicide did law enforcement begin classifying it as a police killing, the family said. 

Some of Massey’s family did not learn who had actually killed her until they read news reports about the 6 July killing, her father, James Wilburn, said on Tuesday.

Massey’s killing has drawn condemnation from Democratic politicians across Illinois and throughout the country, including from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.",2024-07-24 20:12:29

"US president Joe Biden made the decision to end his re-election campaign today and offered his “full support and endorsement” to Harris to be the Democratic nominee.

The announcement came weeks before the Democrats are set to formally choose their nominee at the convention in Chicago, plunging an already tumultuous contest deeper into unchartered waters – while thrusting his potential successor into the spotlight.

"Vice-president Kamala Harris has said she will seek the Democratic presidential nomination after Joe Biden endorsed her as his successor following his decision to suspend his re-election campaign.

“Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election,” she said in a statement. “And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead.”

The almost unprecedented shake up comes after a dramatic three weeks, in which pressure and speculation reached a fever pitch over Biden’s future, following a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump in his late June.

Biden is the first president in 56 years to call off his campaign for re-election.

In a statement, Barack Obama called Biden “one of America’s most consequential presidents”, but did not endorse Harris and seemed to indicate he wanted an open nomination process at the Democratic national convention next month, in Chicago.

Meanwhile, Democratic chair Jaime Harrison said “the party will undertake a transparent and orderly process” to find a new candidate.

"Why has Biden ultimately decided to step aside? 

Watch Guardian US's politics correspondent Lauren Gambino’s analysis. 

Joe Biden was quick to endorse his vice-president, Kamala Harris, for the US Democratic party’s 2024 presidential nomination in the wake of his stunning decision not to seek re-election to the White House.

In a tweet posted minutes after the publication of his letter announcing his decision to withdraw from the race, the president said choosing Harris to be his second-in-command for the duration of his term of office was “the best decision I’ve made”.

The message also said he was committed to focusing on the rest of his time in the White House while his party made a decision on his successor at the top of the ticket for the November election.",2024-07-21 22:16:34
"Joe Biden has withdrawn from the race for the US presidency, an extraordinary decision that plunges the Democratic nomination into uncertainty just months before the November election against Donald Trump.

The president made the shocking announcement after a weeks-long pressure campaign by Democratic leaders, organizers and donors who increasingly saw no path to victory so long as the embattled incumbent remained on the ticket. 

More than 30 Democratic members of Congress had called on Biden to step aside. As recently as Friday, his campaign had insisted he was staying in the race. An ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday found that 60% of Democrats believed he should end his bid.

A disastrous debate performance last month, and his uneven public appearances since, have only exacerbated longstanding voter concerns that the 81-year-old president was simply too old to serve another four years.

Biden’s decision to step aside from the race, though remain as president, caps a singular few weeks in American politics, the latest stunning episode in an unusually tumultuous election season.

"A global IT failure has caused chaos at airports, banks, healthcare services and businesses around the world after a faulty software update triggered “the largest IT outage in history”.

Microsoft’s Windows system was at the center of the outage, after it was hit by a faulty software update from the US cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike that left large numbers of workers facing an error screen labeled the “blue screen of death” as their computers failed to start.

Experts said the recovery could take days because every affected PC may have to be fixed manually.

CrowdStrike confirmed the outage was due to a software update from one of its products and was not caused by a cyber-attack.

In the US, flights were grounded owing to communications problems that appear to be linked to the outage. American Airlines, Delta and United Airlines were among the carriers affected.

There has been more than 1,000 flight cancellations worldwide so far due to the IT failure, according to the aviation analysis firm Cirium.

"JD Vance, Donald Trump’s vice-presidential pick, rocketed into the public eye with his 2016 memoir turned Netflix movie Hillbilly Elegy.

But the book “perpetuates a stereotyped representation of Appalachia, one in which people like me don’t exist,” writes Neema Avashia, who is the daughter of Indian immigrants and was born and raised in southern West Virginia.

“Back in 2016, I was an Appalachian expat living in Boston, feeling homesick and displaced like I do most of the time up here,” she writes. “I saw a book in the Harvard Coop with the word Hillbilly on the cover and jumped at it.”

“I barely read 30 pages before I saw the book Hillbilly Elegy for what it was: a political platform masquerading as memoir. Before I saw JD Vance for what he was: an opportunist. One willing to double down on stereotypes, to paint the people of Appalachia with a culture of poverty brush, rather than be honest about the ways in which both electoral politics and industry have failed our region.”

"“The actual topography has changed. There are hills where there were none,” a UN official based in Gaza told the Guardian last week.

Months of a grinding Israeli offensive have led to massive destruction of homes and infrastructure that will cost $500m-$600m to clear, an assessment published last month by the UN environment programme has found.

Schools, health facilities, roads, sewers and other critical infrastructure have suffered massive damage, while the mountains of rubble are full of unexploded ordnance that leads to “more than 10 explosions every week”, causing more deaths and loss of limbs, Gaza’s civil defence agency has said.

The conflict could also reduce levels of health, education and wealth in the territory to those of 1980, wiping out 44 years of development, according to a report published in May by the UN development programme as part of a push to raise funds for early planning for the rehabilitation of Gaza.

Now the two men are running mates -  here’s what to you need to know. 📸AP/Getty/Reuters #2024vote #2024election #trump #biden #vance #jdvance #uspolitics #appalachia #ohio",2024-07-16 11:52:58
"Donald Trump has named JD Vance, the Ohio senator and bestselling author of the 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, as his running mate for the 2024 election.

When Trump first ran for office, Vance’s eventual nomination to run alongside him would have seemed implausible. Vance was once among Trump’s conservative critics, saying during an October 2016 interview that he was a “terrible candidate”.

He even wondered aloud, in texts to a former roommate, whether Trump was more of “a cynical asshole like Nixon”, or worse, “America’s Hitler”.

Since then, Vance has made a dramatic transformation into a Maga power figure and close ally of the former president who has supported some of Trump’s more authoritarian impulses, like questioning the results of the 2020 election and, in a 2021 podcast interview, suggesting Trump should purge civil servants from the federal government if re-elected.

Vance has already vied for Trump’s blessing once before, while campaigning for a seat representing Ohio in the US Senate. During the primary, Vance pitched himself as a Trump-style rightwing populist.

In office, Vance has consistently aligned with the populist right, calling into question the US’s role in foreign conflicts and backing rightwing domestic legislation. In 2023, for example, he introduced a bill that would make English the official language of the US.

"The latest Israeli airstrikes add to one of deadliest weeks in the Gaza war, and come amid uncertainty over whether Hamas has withdrawn from ceasefire talks.

Four attacks in various parts of Gaza City in the early hours of Sunday took place less than 24 hours after Israeli forces said they had targeted Mohammed Deif, the alleged mastermind behind the 7 October attack, in a strike in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza that reportedly killed more than 90 people and injured 300 others.

Another 14 people were killed in a strike on Sunday morning near a UN-run school being used as a shelter for displaced people in Nuseirat, central Gaza, journalists at the scene said. Israel said Hamas militants were present in the area.

Sunday’s bombings add to what was already one of the deadliest weeks of Israeli aerial attacks on Gaza since the war broke out nine months ago.

More than 38,400 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory operation in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-administered territory, and the population of 2.3 million people is in the grips of a devastating humanitarian crisis.

"“There has long been violence in American politics.” writes Guardian US columnist Moira Donegan.

Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords was injured in a mass shooting at a constituent event in Arizona in 2011; President Reagan survived an assassination attempt in 1981, and black Americans have faced violent oppression when attempting to exercise their right to vote.

But the assassination attempt of Donald Trump on Saturday at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, which left a spectator and the gunman dead, two other critically injured and the former president with a wound to the ear, “was a grim reminder of the new era of intensified political violence in which we are living”.

As an increasingly polarised nation reeled from the attack, with disinformation and conspiracy theories from left and right alike about the shooting – the motives for which currently remain unknown – sweeping social media, Joe Biden on Sunday forcefully condemned political violence and appealed for people to reject “extremism and fury”.

“There is no place in America for this kind of violence – for any violence. Ever. Period. No exception,” the president said. “We can’t allow this violence to be normalised.”

"Law enforcement agents were investigating what they suspected was an attempt to assassinate Donald Trump after a man with a rifle fired shots at him during a campaign rally on Saturday in Butler county, Pennsylvania.

The Secret Service spokesperson, Anthony Gugliemi, said on X that “the former president [was] safe” following several shots, which prompted agents protecting Trump to leap on him amid the ensuing panic. 

Gugliemi said Secret Service agents then fatally shot the suspected attacker – who had fired toward Trump “from an elevated position outside of the rally venue”, Gugliemi said.

One spectator was killed and two others were critically wounded. The shooter was not immediately identified.

In a pair of statements, Trump said he was “fine” after a bullet struck “the upper part of [his] right ear”.

The former president also issued thanks to the Secret Service agents as well as other law enforcement officers for “their rapid response” in a Truth Social post in the shooting’s aftermath.

“Mostly importantly, I want to extend my condolences to the family of the person at the rally who was killed and also to the family of [those] badly injured,” said Trump, who was taken to a hospital for evaluation and then reportedly released about 10.20pm local time.

“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our country.”

"Every day, nearly 2,000 children under five are dying from air pollution - meaning it has overtaken poor sanitation and a lack of clean water to become the second biggest health risk factor for youngsters around the world.

More than 8 million deaths, of children and adults, were caused by air pollution in 2021, according to a new study from the Health Effects Institute (HEI), as both outdoor and indoor pollution continue to take an increasing toll on health.

Dirty air is now the second biggest killer globally, overtaking tobacco use, and second only to high blood pressure, as a risk factor for death among the general population. Among children under five, air pollution is second only to malnutrition as a risk factor in mortality.

This year’s State of Global Air report, published in June, and produced this year in partnership with Unicef, also shows that children in poor countries are suffering some of the worst impacts, with the death rate linked to air pollution in children under five 100 times higher in most of Africa than it is in high income countries.

"At the beginning of a new parliament, all MPs are required to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch before taking their seats in the House of Commons. If they do not, they cannot sit or vote in the chamber or receive their salary.

On Wednesday, as the process of swearing in all 650 MPs began, the Labour MP Clive Lewis said he was declaring his allegiance to the king “under protest”, adding: “I take this oath under protest and in the hope that one day my fellow citizens will democratically decide to live in a republic.”

The Scottish National party MP Seamus Logan, who is the new representative for Aberdeenshire North and Moray East, said he was reading the oath “under protest”.

The Social Democratic and Labour party leader, Colum Eastwood, who is the returning MP for Foyle in Northern Ireland, said: “I read out this empty formula in order to represent my constituents, but it’s under protest … My true allegiance is to the people of Derry and to the people of Ireland.”

Eastwood is one of two SDLP MPs in parliament. His colleague Claire Hanna also protested, saying first in Gaelic then in English: “In friendship and hope of a reconciled new Ireland, I affirm my allegiance to the people of South Belfast & Mid Down and read the words required to serve them.”

"Do you think the UK needs to change its voting system?

After a historic set of results in last week’s election, this is the new landscape of British politics.

Smaller parties achieved record vote shares, while independent candidates broke through in many places and the Liberal Democrats regained their status as the third largest party.

But while the colours look definitive, the unbalanced relationship between the number of seats won by the parties versus their share of the total vote paints a different picture – and has led some to call for a change to the way the voting system works.

The 2024 election was “one of the most disproportionate results in recent history”, according to Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society.

The UK uses a first-past-the-post system, which tends to exaggerate the representation of larger parties in parliament in order to create majorities, and often leaves smaller parties clutching on to a handful of seats relative to their vote share.

While Labour won 63% of seats from only 33.8% of the vote, Reform took 14.3% of the popular vote – making it the third biggest party by vote share – but won only five seats.

In contrast the Lib Dems won a record 72 seats despite a vote share of about 12%. The Green party received 6.8% of the vote for its four seats.

“We have already had a growing chorus of calls for PR [proportional representation] in the aftermath,” said Hughes, which allows voters to vote for candidates in order of preference.

Some experts argue that PR has produced more social democratic politics in Wales and Scotland. However, others say it could be a pathway for extremist politics, as has happened in some places in Europe.

And it’s only just started,” said France’s Green leader Marine Tondelier, as thousands took to the streets of Paris to celebrate a surprise left-wing surge that blocked the far-right National Rally (RN) and its allies from their anticipated success in the French elections.

In contrast, there was stunned silence at the far-right National Rally (RN) party headquarters as the results of France’s legislative elections came in.

The leftist alliance unexpectedly took the top spot in the elections, ahead of the far-right in a major upset that bars Marine Le Pen's National Rally from getting enough seats to form a government.

The New Popular Front alliance – which includes the former ruling Socialist party (PS), France Unbowed, Greens and Communists – secured 182 seats in the 577-seat parliament. President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance also performed better than expected with 163 seats, while the RN and their allies came short of their poll leads, with only 143 seats, to come in third.

Leftist party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has called on Macron to step down or choose a new prime minister from the winning leftwing alliance.

Macron’s protege Gabriel Attal announced that he would offer his resignation as prime minister this morning.

"Google’s goal of reducing its climate footprint is in jeopardy as it relies on more and more energy-hungry data centers to power its new artificial intelligence products.

The tech giant revealed Tuesday that its greenhouse gas emissions have climbed 48% over the past five years.

Google said electricity consumption by data centers and supply chain emissions were the primary cause of the increase. It also revealed in its annual environmental report that its emissions in 2023 had risen 13% compared with the previous year.

Data centers play a crucial role in training and operating the models that underpin AI models like Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4, which powers the ChatGPT chatbot.

Pledges to reduce CO2 emissions are now coming up against pledges to invest heavily in AI products that require considerable amounts of energy for training and deployment.

"“Behind these numbers, there are people … people who in the last nine months have been moved around like pawns in a board game,” said Andrea De Domenico, head of the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the Palestinian territories.

He said on Wednesday that about 1.9 million people are thought to be displaced in Gaza.

“We estimate that nine in every 10 people in the Gaza Strip have been internally displaced at least once, if not up to 10 times, unfortunately, since October,” Domenico told reporters.

He said that the strip had been cut in two by Israel’s military operations, with the UN agency estimating that there were between 300,000 and 350,000 people living in the north of the besieged territory who were unable to go to the south.

The bloodiest Gaza war to date broke out after Hamas’s 7 October attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people last year, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.

The militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 whom the army say are dead.

Israel’s retaliatory offensive since then has killed at least 37,953 people, also mostly civilians, according to data from the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

Fresh strikes carried out by Israel on Khan Younis on Tuesday, after it ordered a mass evacuation of much of the city, spurred the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to say “no place is safe in Gaza” for Palestinian civilians.

“It’s another stop in this deadly circular movement that the population in Gaza has to undergo on a regular basis,” Guterres said in a statement calling for a ceasefire.

"“While our carbon emissions are minuscule, our region bears the brunt of the impacts of climate,” said Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, as Hurricane Beryl made landfall, wreaking havoc across the Caribbean.

Beryl, the 2024 Atlantic season’s first hurricane and the earliest storm on record to reach the highest category, left what the prime minister of Grenada, Dickon Mitchell, called a trail of “almost complete destruction” in the country, as well as St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG).

Record-breaking sea temperatures – about 2F to 3.6F (1C to 2C ) above normal – driven by the human-caused climate crisis, have facilitated Beryl’s explosive growth and may be a “harbinger” of even more potential threats to come, according to experts.

“It’s a terrible time for small-island developing states and vulnerable countries.” said the prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalve, on Monday, with wind howling in the background.

He called out rich countries for climate failures, saying that “for the major emitters of greenhouse gases, those who contribute most to global warming, you are getting a lot of talking, but you are not seeing a lot of action”.

“I am hopeful that what is happening –and we are quite early in the hurricane season – will alert them to our vulnerabilities, our weaknesses and encourage them to honour the commitments they have made.”

"The US supreme court has ruled that former presidents are entitled to some degree of immunity from criminal prosecution, dramatically reducing the likelihood that the federal criminal case against Donald Trump on charges he plotted to stop the transfer of power will proceed before the 2024 election.

The court’s conservative majority – which Trump helped create – found that presidents were protected from prosecution for official actions that extended to the “outer perimeter” of his office, but could face charges for conduct undertaken in a personal or private manner.

Trump is accused of overseeing a sprawling effort to subvert the 2020 election, including two counts of conspiring to obstruct the certification of the election results, conspiring to defraud the government, and conspiring to disenfranchise voters.

Among the accusations: Trump spread false claims of election fraud, plotted to recruit fake slates of electors, pressured US justice department officials to open sham investigations into election fraud, and pressured his vice-president, Mike Pence, to obstruct Congress’s certification of Joe Biden’s win.

The ruling in Trump’s election subversion case was one of the last handed down by the supreme court this term. In waiting until the end, the conservative majority played into Trump’s benefit and legal strategy of trying to delay any trial as much as possible.

"You approach a desk and are met by two stern immigration officials. A stream of instructions and questions are barked at you: “Stand shoulder to shoulder”; “Look me in the eyes”; “Are you British?”

This is the welcome visitors receive at Terminal 1, a new area at this year’s Glastonbury festival run by artists who are all migrants and which gives attendees a taste of what it feels like to sample British border “hospitality”.

Emblazoned with the old sign from Heathrow’s Terminal 1, the new area attracted a long queue on Saturday morning as dozens of festival-goers waited their turn to be grilled.

“Terminal 1’s message is: ‘No one is illegal”. That is our message – to remind us that we are all humans, we are all migrants, one way or another,” says Miguel Hernando Torres Umba, the performance director. He said he wanted people to come away with an experience of what immigration was like for “the majority of people around the globe”.

“I think we’re in a very privileged place,” said Hernando Torres Umba. “I think sometimes what’s important is to understand, though, is that some people don’t have those privileges”.

“And I think it’s very important to look at [immigration] directly as it is a shared responsibility with the world”.

The theme of immigration can be found across Glastonbury this year.

Banksy’s latest Glastonbury stunt – sending out an inflatable dinghy with dummies representing child migrants during Idles’ headlining set – ensured the issue of immigration was beamed out live on the BBC.

The topic has been one of the overarching themes of the upcoming general election, whether through Rishi Sunak’s pledge to “stop the boats”, Keir Starmer and Labour’s plan to establish a “command centre” to deter those trying to enter across the Channel or Reform’s promise of “net zero migration”.

Glastonbury’s notably leftwing political undercurrent has been much in evidence this year, with references to next week’s general election – and calls to vote – ­dotted throughout the festival.

Dialled-In’s co-founder, @dhruvacurly says: “I think there’s been an attitude shift over the last five to six years, but this signifies that it has culminated to a point where South Asian people are not only just given a space, but an opportunity to showcase the breadth of what South Asia means to us. 

“It’s not just having an artist from one region of South Asia, it’s having Nepalese, Bengali, Afghani, Mauritian, Indian, Pakistani, Tamil artists all together on one line up on one space building together.”

@shankho_c,  who designed Arrivals alongside @__4resh and @shir.in___ added: “What’s amazing about particularly the British South Asian Diaspora experience is that we have built our identity often in the absence of sort of role models in the arts, because we’ve been kind of systematically kept outside of those spaces.

"After Biden’s calamitous showing in Thursday’s presidential debate with Donald Trump, Democrats are panicking and openly talking about who could possibly replace him as the party’s nominee.

Anything can happen, but replacing a candidate at this stage also presents a long and unprecedented road. There is no formal mechanism that could replace Biden as the presumptive nominee, and such a move would be the first time a US political party has attempted to do so in modern times.

In effect, the only option would be for Biden to agree to step aside and allow the delegates he won in the primaries – who vote to nominate a candidate at August’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago – to choose someone else.

There is no legal requirement for delegates to vote for the person who won in the primaries, but they are asked to vote in a way that “in all good conscience reflects the sentiments of those who elected them”.

So far Biden has also resisted calls to abandon his re-election effort and step aside for a younger candidate.

“Trump is only three years younger, but is a creature of television. When Biden spoke, the former president, hair hovering above his head like a shiny cloud, could be seen frowning, pursing his lips or revving up for a reply.

"It had survived conflict before: Press House, in the upscale neighbourhood of Rimal, Gaza, was founded in 2013 with the vision of being a politically independent incubator for Palestinian journalism.

A year after its creation, in the back garden, their team planted 17 olive trees in memory of reporters killed during an escalation of violence.

But now, those trees are buried under rubble and the building, like much of northern Gaza, is destroyed.

As for their network of journalists who were trained and supported by the non-profit, founded by journalist Bilal Jadallah, nearly a dozen are amongst the 108 media workers who have lost their lives since Israel’s invasion of Gaza – recorded by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which describes this war as the deadliest period for media workers since it began collating its figures three decades ago.

Eight months on from Hama’s deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 Oct, in which 1,200 Israelis died, a reported 37,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive. Foreign media is banned by Israel and Egypt from entering Gaza to cover the war.

Instead Palestinian reporters such as those trained by Press House – including journalists like Plestia Alaqad – have been the only journalists reporting from the ground.

A spokesperson for the IDF claims that “the narrative that the IDF is intentionally targeting journalists is utterly unfounded and fundamentally false,” and that “civilians who are harmed, including journalists harmed during the conflict, are a terrible tragedy”.

"For more than a decade Julian Assange has been hidden away – for seven years he was confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London, refusing to come out in case he was arrested – until he was finally removed and detained in Belmarsh prison. In a small cell for 23 hours a day he faced charges that, had he been extradited and convicted, would carry a sentence of up to 170 years in a US prison. But now finally, and suddenly, he is being freed.

A plea deal with the US Justice department has reduced his 18 charges to one – carrying a sentence of five years. And the time he has spent in jail allows him to be freed by the court immediately. Finally, he can see his family in his home country of Australia.

But many see the deal as a dangerous one for journalists. 

Assange is being prosecuted under the US Espionage Act – a law that goes back more than 100 years. Using it against someone who has disseminated classified information could make it easier to use such a law against investigative journalists in the future. Will this set a worrying precedent?

"WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been released from a British prison and is expected to plead guilty to violating US espionage law, in a deal with US authorities that would allow him to return home to his native Australia.

Assange,52, who has spent the last five years in prison fighting extradition to the US, is expected to plead guilty to a single US felony charge, according to filings in the US district court for the Northern Mariana Islands.

WikiLeaks posted on social media a video of its founder boarding a flight at London’s Stansted airport on Monday evening. He is expected to be on his way to Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands.

Assange was set to be reunited with his wife, Stella, who confirmed on X that he was free. She thanked Assange’s supporters, saying “words cannot express our immense gratitude”.

Some experts warned that a conviction for Assange, even on a single count, could have a devastating and prolonged impact on investigative and national security journalism.

Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University warned that the outcome could “cast a long shadow over the most important kinds of journalism, not just in this country but around the world”.

This deal “could spell the end to a years-long saga that has spanned continents and seen him hailed as both a champion of press freedom and a threat to national security,” writes @guardianaustralia Jonathan Yerushalmy.

"“This is now an all-out scandal at the heart of Rishi Sunak’s Conservative party”.

This is how Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper described the recent revelations that five people with links to Rishi Sunak or the Conservative party are being investigated by the gambling watchdog for bets placed on the date of the general election before the date was announced.

“If you’re in a privileged position [close] to the prime minister at the heart of a political operation and you use inside information to make additional money for yourself, that’s just not acceptable …” the levelling up, housing and communities secretary Michael Gove told the Sunday Times.

A Guardian analysis shows that a sudden flood of bets on a July election was placed on Tuesday 21 May on the Betfair Exchange, before Sunak had even told his own cabinet of senior politicians that the early election was going ahead.

Between January and May, an average of £27 a day was gambled on Sunak calling a general election in July, and most people bet just a few pounds on what was seen as an unlikely outcome.

Then, the day before Sunak’s announcement, a total of £3,285 was gambled on Betfair in dozens of bets. Some punters stuck on hundreds of pounds, suggesting serious confidence and driving the odds down.

Although the data came from only one specialist online bookmaker, it immediately suggested the scale of bets across the whole industry may have been more substantial – as the Gambling Commission’s own inquiries appear to be bearing out.

"Gunmen opened fire in two cities in Russia’s north Caucasus region of Dagestan, targeting a synagogue, two Orthodox churches and a police post and killing at least 19 police officers and a priest, officials said.

“This is a day of tragedy for Dagestan and the whole country,” Sergei Melikov, governor of the Dagestan region, said in a video published early on Monday on the Telegram messaging app.

In the city of Derbent, gunmen attacked a synagogue, home to a Jewish community in the predominantly Muslim region. Russia’s state media Tass said the attackers also shot at two nearby Orthodox churches, killing a police officer and a priest.

Melikov said that among the dead, in addition to the police officers, were several civilians, including a priest who worked in Derbent for more than 40 years.

In a separate shooting which occurred simultaneously, a group opened fire on police in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, located about 75 miles north along the Caspian Sea coast. According to local authorities, at least one police officer was killed and six others injured.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks in the volatile region. But, Russia’s investigative committee classified the shooting as a terrorist attack and has opened an investigation.

“We understand who is behind the organisation of the terrorist attacks and what goal they pursued,” Melikov said, without disclosing further details.

"In 2019, Akua Page was invited to a juvenile incarceration facility in South Carolina, to give a presentation about the Gullah Geechee language, an English-based creole created by enslaved Africans.

When the teens walked into the room, Page recalled, they seemed hardened, angry and annoyed. Undeterred, she began her lesson.

“I told them: ‘Hey, I understand y’all are Gullah Geechee,’” the 30-year-old educator said. “I validated them first, and said: ‘Y’all are bilingual. You’re not dumb, you don’t have a learning disability – you’re just bilingual, and here’s what you can do to navigate the system you’re in.’”

Gullah is still spoken today by some people in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, the states that make up the Gullah Geechee region, though it’s much rarer than it once was.

But getting people – even Gullah Geechee folks themselves – to fully appreciate and understand the importance of perpetuating Gullah Geechee culture is not always easy for teachers.

But a growing contingent of Gullah Geechee people, like Page, are working to revive the language. Through their promotion of the dialect, they are shepherding it into the future, ensuring that the first documented language created by people who would go on to become Black Americans is maintained.

"“We need the world to wake up to the catastrophe happening before our very eyes,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, has said.

The war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has pushed the levels of displacement and hunger to such an extreme that the country faces a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

14,000 people have been killed in the violence in Sudan so far, according to the UN. The World Food Programme reports that nearly 18 million people are facing acute hunger – 5 million at emergency levels – with food prices 350% above the five-year average.

Sudan is also facing the world’s largest child displacement crisis, as millions flee the ongoing violence, Unicef reports.

“Our situation is bad, we don't have any money for food,” seven-year-old Retaj told Unicef, whose family fled their home in El Fasher, amid horrific reports of violence, to Zamzam camp near the city. Thirty percent of children at the camp have been found to be suffering from acute malnutrition, according to MSF.

“I just want the war to stop. And for us to find food and water,” said Retaj.

Despite aid agencies attempting to mitigate the damage of a famine, the ongoing violence and restrictions on movement have prevented supplies getting to parts of the country.

"At least 550 pilgrims have died during the hajj, underscoring the gruelling nature of the pilgrimage which again unfolded in scorching temperatures this year.

At least 323 of those who died were Egyptians, most of them succumbing to heat-related illnesses, the two Arab diplomats coordinating their countries’ responses told AFP. The diplomats said the total at the morgue in Al-Muaisem, one of the biggest in Mecca, was 550.

The hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam and all Muslims with the means to must complete it at least once.

The pilgrimage is increasingly affected by climate breakdown, according to a Saudi study published last month that said temperatures in the area where rituals are performed were rising 0.4C (0.72F) each decade.

Temperatures hit 51.8C at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Monday, the Saudi national meteorology centre said.

Saudi officials had advised pilgrims to use umbrellas, drink plenty of water and avoid exposure to the sun during the hottest hours of the day.

But many of the hajj rituals, including the prayers on Mount Arafat which took place on Saturday, involve being outdoors for hours in the daytime.

About 1.8 million pilgrims took part in the hajj this year, 1.6 million of them from abroad, according to Saudi authorities.

A schoolboy at fee-charging Eton has access to 140 times more green space than the average English state school pupil, our analysis found. Experts have condemned the “staggering” and “gross” inequalities.

We mapped the land owned and used by the top private schools in the country – an area never previously established. Using publicly available information alongside satellite tools to map school buildings and green space, the analysis established that:

• The average student at one of England’s top private schools has access to approximately 322 sq metres of green space, whereas the average state school student has access to about 32 sq metres of green space: a ratio of 10:1.
• In total the private schools own 38,086 acres of land. (154.1m sq metres), of which 19,430 (78.6m sq metres), according to the Guardian’s analysis, is accessible to the students.
• In contrast, some state schools have little or no green space at all for their students.

“I want to be proud to represent France,” said Mbappé. “This is a never-seen-before event and that is why I want to talk to the whole of the French people, but also the youth. We are a generation that can make a difference. 

“We see the extremes are knocking on the door of power and we have the opportunity to shape our country’s future. This is why I call on all young people to go vote and to become aware of the importance of the situation.

“People say don’t mix football and politics but we are talking about a situation that is really important, more important than the game. The situation in our country is dire and we need to act.”

"“If the chinampas disappear, it is just a reflection of this general mindset in societies, this western belief that nature or spaces are at the service of human beings and nothing more. I can’t imagine a world where there aren’t chinampas, but that’s why I’m here – to ensure that doesn’t happen,” says Mixtli Barrera Fernández whose family has a farm in the chinampas, Mexico’s ‘floating gardens’.

Springs once filled the chinampas with water that was clean enough for people to drink straight from the canals. The community still holds rituals and celebrations in these sacred lagoons, which at one time were accessible only on special occasions, to preserve the water quality and protect wildlife. They are now visited by increasing numbers of tourist boats and kayakers on sunrise tours.

Mixtli hopes to combine her degree in biology with the traditional skills passed down from her father to work on conservation and restoration projects.

Others in Mixtli’s community have opened the first chinampa school, offering courses in agroecology, culture and history, cuisine and science-backed traditional medicine. It is hoped that students will learn not just to be farmers, but to become chinamperos and future guardians of La Chinampería.

"Argentina’s Senate narrowly approved controversial austerity measures proposed by the president, Javier Milei, amid violent protests.

Thousands of demonstrators, including bankers, teachers and truckers, had peacefully converged around Congress throughout the day, banging drums and chanting: “Our country is not for sale!” 

Police in Buenos Aires later used water cannon and teargas as some protesters hurled sticks, stones and molotov cocktails at officers, and overturned cars.

After 11 hours of heated debate, senators voted 37 to 36 in favour of the bill late on Wednesday. Lawmakers must now hold an article-by-article vote set to last through the night. If the Senate approves the bills with modifications, the lower house still has to approve them before Milei can officially pass his first law since taking office in December.

The fiery rightwing economist was elected on promises he would resolve Argentina’s worst economic crisis in two decades.

But his political party holds just a tiny minority of seats in Congress and he has struggled to strike deals with the opposition.

"In a shock move, the French president has called a snap parliamentary election that will take place on 30 June.

Emmanuel Macron said he would dissolve France’s parliament and call new legislative elections after his centrist alliance was beaten in EU elections by Marine Le Pen’s far-right party.

“I cannot pretend as if nothing happened,” said the president, acknowledging the results were a disaster for his government.

Macron has been accused of gambling with French democracy as his party could suffer yet more losses, in effect hobbling the rest of his presidential term and potentially handing Le Pen even more power.

"“I don't want to completely say drinking is terrible,” says Annie Davies, 25, who shares her alcohol-free life on TikTok. “But personally, I think everyone would benefit from just assessing their relationship with alcohol.”

@annievdavies says she started drinking when 13 – the reality for many people in England, which has some of the highest rates of alcohol consumption among school children, according to a recent study of over 40 countries by the World Health Organization.

The survey found more than half of 13-year-olds have drunk alcohol in England as have a third of all 11-year-olds.

Davies says that, as she got older, drinking became a massive part of her identity, and how she had fun. But she also started to realise the impact it was having on her mental and physical health.

“It got to the point that when I was hungover, I was anxious for days,” Davies says. “I would get shortness of breath, chest pains, and I just thought that was normal. It sounds so weird now to think that was normal”.

In the beginning, she says she blocked out her fears “with UK drinking culture and how immersed we all are in it, I was kind of like – what do I do without drinking?”

"“Children, women are terrified, but unfortunately they don’t have anywhere to go,” said journalist Hind Khoudary, after an Israeli strike hit a UN school in central Gaza.

Israel bombed a UN school which was sheltering displaced Palestinians in the early hours of Thursday morning, killing at least 30 people including five children, hospital authorities said.

The Israeli military said the airstrike targeted terrorists who took part in the 7 October attacks and were planning imminent attacks on troops in the area.

The airstrike came as Israel escalated its military operations in central Gaza, and soon after another strike on a home in Deir al-Balah killed at least six people.

Israel’s military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble. The war was sparked by an attack by Hamas in southern Israel in October last year, killing about 1,200 people.

Israel has blocked the entry of much aid and fuel to Gaza, and cut off most of the water supply.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has meanwhile threatened an “extremely powerful” response to attacks by Hezbollah from Lebanon, which have escalated in recent days and set off huge fires in northern Israel.

"The first TV debate of the UK election campaign turned out to be a fiery matchup. Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer tore into each other’s election promises on tax, healthcare and immigration.

The pair exchanged barbs in an ill-tempered session in front of an ITV studio audience in Salford.
As the party leaders tried to draw dividing lines between the parties, Starmer hammered the Conservative record after 14 years in government and accused Sunak of failing to take personal responsibility for his failures, including the cost of living and NHS waiting times.
[When asked if they would use private healthcare if a loved one was on a long waiting list for an operation, Sunak said yes, while Starmer said he would not and would rely on the national health service alone.]

During the hour of intense debate, Sunak sought to present Starmer as an unreliable politician who was pursuing power for power’s sake. 

He claimed repeatedly that Labour’s policies would lead to a £2,000 tax rise for families, an attack the Tories are planning to deploy repeatedly over this campaign, but has come under heavy scrutiny and “is very unproven and most likely incorrect”, according to our political correspondents.

"Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party has lost its parliamentary majority, dealing an unexpected blow to the Indian prime minister.

With all votes counted early on Wednesday morning, it was clear that the landslide for the BJP predicted in polls had not materialised and instead there had been a pushback against the strongman PM, who has now had to negotiate with coalition partners in order to return to power.

The party lost 62 seats, bringing its total down to 240, below the 272 required for a parliamentary majority.

It is the first time since Modi was elected in 2014 that the BJP has not won a clear majority on its own. Nonetheless, together with its political allies, known as the national democratic alliance (NDA), its win amounts to about 292 seats, which is enough to form a majority government to rule for the next five years and return Modi to office for a third term.

Despite the tight race, Modi insisted he had been given a mandate to lead again in a victory speech. Addressing voters at the BJP headquarters in Delhi, Modi said he was “very, very happy today”.

“Our opponents, despite being united, could not even win as many seats as BJP won,” he added.

Meanwhile, the opposition alliance, which goes by the acronym INDIA, far outperformed expectations, collectively winning more than 230 seats. The alliance, formed of more than 20 national and regional opposition parties, had come together for the first time in this election with the aim of defeating Modi.

Analysts said results indicated that the “Modi wave” had been dented by problems such as high unemployment and inflation. In the aftermath of the election, Modi will probably have to grapple with a more powerful and more animated opposition than at any point over the past decade.

"“The world will never forget Rob Burrow. He is a hero to so many people and an inspiration to all who were lucky enough to meet him or came across his story on and off the pitch,” said former Rhinos teammate, Barrie McDermott, as he paid tribute to the rugby league legend Rob Burrow, who has died at the age of 41 following a short illness.

Burrow, one of the modern era’s great players who won every domestic honour available throughout a stellar playing career with Leeds as well as being capped by both England and Great Britain, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019 and helped inspire almost £20m in fundraising to support people living with the condition. Alongside former teammate and close friend Kevin Sinfield, the pair brought MND into the national consciousness. 

In a statement the Burrow family said: “The outpouring of love and support that Rob and the whole Burrow family have received over the last four and a half years meant so much to Rob. In particular, the rugby league family and the MND community have rallied around Rob to inspire him, thank you for your support.

“For those who knew Rob throughout his life, his determination and spirit in the face of MND over the last four and a half years came as no surprise. Rob never accepted that he couldn’t do something, he just found his own way of doing it better than anyone else. He will continue to inspire us all every day. In a world full of adversity, we must dare to dream.”

Burrow made 492 appearances for Leeds, placing him fifth in the club’s all-time appearance list. He was capped five times by Great ­Britain, 15 by England and won the ­Challenge Cup in 2014 and 2015, as well as the World Club Challenge on three ­occasions. He remains one of the modern era’s most decorated players.

That was Barry Glendenning’s verdict on the Champions League final on Saturday night as Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 at Wembley stadium to secure a historic 15th Champions League title for the Spanish champions.

Goals from Dani Carvajal and Vinicius Junior in the second half sealed the win but it was a very different story in the first half. 

Real Madrid didn’t register a single shot on target and Borussia Dortmund missed clear cut chance after clear cut chance which culminated with Karim Adeyemi rounding Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois but unable to put the ball in the back of the net.

"In an exclusive interview, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has revealed the tactics and traits that help him face the daily frustrations of leading a country that has been at war for more than two years.

Inside Kyiv’s presidential compound, Zelenskiy sat down to speak for nearly an hour with a Guardian team, including the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner.

The interview came at perhaps the toughest moment for Ukraine since the early days of the war. Zelenskiy insisted, however, that it was too early to write off the country, and that he remained positive. “I’m not in despair at all … I don’t feel like we are on a sinking ship which is going to the bottom.

"Twelve jurors in New York have presented their fellow Americans with a simple question: are you willing to elect a convicted criminal to the White House?

Donald Trump has just been found guilty of all 34 counts of falsifying business records in a criminal hush-money scheme to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. The verdict makes him the first president, current or former, to be found guilty of felony crimes in the US’s near 250-year history. Regardless, the conviction does not disqualify Trump as a presidential candidate or bar him from again sitting in the Oval Office.

Trump, who opted not to take the stand during the trial, has denied wrongdoing, railed against the proceedings and ahead of the verdict compared himself to a saint: “Mother Teresa could not beat these charges. The charges are rigged,” he said on Wednesday. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, is expected to appeal the verdict.

"Donald Trump has been found guilty of using a criminal hush-money scheme to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. He was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records.

The verdict came after a jury deliberated for less than twelve hours in the unprecedented first criminal trial against a US president. 

It marks a perilous political moment for Trump, the presumptive nominee for the Republican nomination, whose poll numbers have remained unchanged throughout the trial but could tank at any moment.

Trump was convicted by a jury of 12 New Yorkers of felony falsification of business records, which makes it a crime for a person to make or cause false entries in records with the intent to commit a second crime.

In Trump’s case, the Manhattan district attorney’s office alleged Trump falsely recorded the reimbursements he made to his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who paid the adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her silence about her affair with Trump, as “legal expenses”.

The prosecution alleged the falsifications were made to conceal Trump’s violation of New York state election law, which makes it a crime to promote the election of any person to office through unlawful means.

A Human Rights Watch (HRW) report has detailed gruesome testimony from witnesses who describe children being “piled up and shot” by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Darfur’s regional capital of El Geneina last summer during a bout of ethnic violence in which thousands of civilians were killed.

Together the 221 witness statements, collated by HRW in a report published earlier this month, offer further evidence that the Arab-led RSF has orchestrated a concerted 12-month campaign of ethnic cleansing against Sudan’s non-Arab Masalit tribe in West Darfur.

"Israeli tanks conducted a second day of probing attacks across Rafah on Wednesday after Washington said an assault on Sunday did not amount to a major ground incursion of the city in the south of Gaza, which US officials had told Israel to avoid.

According to the news agency, Israeli tanks advanced to the heart of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday after a night of heavy bombardment, defying an appeal from the international court of justice to end its attack on the city, one of the last places of refuge in Gaza.

Growing international outrage over the Israeli push into Rafah and Sunday’s attack, in which at least 45 people were killed by an airstrike and huge fire in an area crowded with refugee tents, have not had any apparent impact on Israel’s military plans.

The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described the civilian deaths as a “tragic mistake” but vowed to continue the operation. Later a spokesperson for the IDF said its airstrike had not caused the fire.

About 1 million Palestinians have fled Rafah since early May, but hundreds of thousands are still sheltering there, Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said yesterday.

“[They left] with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions,” Unrwa said in a post on X. “Day after day, providing assistance and protection becomes nearly impossible.”

"The former head of the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, allegedly threatened a chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) to abandon a war crimes investigation, the Guardian can reveal.

Yossi Cohen’s covert contacts with the ICC’s then prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, took place in the years leading up to her decision to open a formal investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in occupied Palestinian territories.

That investigation, launched in 2021, culminated last week when Bensouda’s successor, Karim Khan, announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over the country’s conduct in its war in Gaza.

Cohen was one of Netanyahu’s closest allies at the time and personally led the Mossad’s involvement in an almost decade-long campaign by the country to undermine the court.

An Israeli source briefed on the operation against Bensouda said the Mossad’s objective was to compromise the prosecutor or enlist her as someone who would cooperate with Israel’s demands.

Four sources confirmed that Bensouda had briefed a small group of senior ICC officials about Cohen’s attempts to sway her, amid concerns about the increasingly persistent and threatening nature of his behaviour.

According to accounts shared with ICC officials, he is alleged to have told her: “You should help us and let us take care of you. You don’t want to be getting into things that could compromise your security or that of your family.”

"“We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,” said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene after an Israeli airstrike on Rafah in southern Gaza hit tents housing displaced people on Sunday.

“We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” Abuassa told the Associated Press.

At least 45 people were killed in the attack, Palestinian medics said, with images of charred and dismembered children prompting an outcry from world leaders.

The strike on the north-western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan occurred days after the international court of justice (ICJ) ordered Israel to cease its operations in Rafah immediately.

More than 85% of the Palestinian territory’s population had sought shelter in Rafah, having fled fighting elsewhere, and a million people have been forced to move again since Israel’s ground operation there began on 6 May.

Israel has been continuing to pound the city with airstrikes and tank fire, pressing its offensive despite international condemnation. Airstrikes on Rafah overnight killed at least 16 Palestinians, first responders said on Tuesday as several Israeli tanks reached the centre of Rafah, witnesses told Reuters.

Addressing parliament, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accepted that “something unfortunately went tragically wrong” despite what he claimed were “our best efforts not to hurt them”. He added: “I will keep fighting until the flag of victory is raised. I don’t intend to end the war before every goal has been achieved.”

These satellite images reveal mountains of debris covering buildings and blocking roads, which officials have said is hampering relief efforts, while rescue teams have been attempting to access the region since Friday, though officials said the odds of finding survivors were slim.

A state of emergency has been declared across the disaster zone and a neighbouring area, which has a combined population of between 4,500 and 8,000, although not all have been ordered to evacuate yet, Sandis Tsaka, the Enga province disaster committee chairperson, told Reuters.

"Are you chronically late?

Maybe you’re a “very late” kind of person, writes Guardian reporter Madeleine Aggeler, the kind that “almost demands a begrudging respect”. Or maybe you’re like her, who suffers from the “more tedious” kind of lateness – the kind where you’re consistently “running 10-15 minutes behind”.

There haven’t been any major surveys looking at this issue recently, but in 2006, 15-20% of Americans said they were “consistently late”, according to ABC News. And a 2017 survey found that nearly 30% of Americans arrive late to work each day.

Either way, she writes, “it occurred to me that I didn’t have to live this way.”

His father Jonathan had wanted to seek advice on potential compensation after he had been infected with HIV and hepatitis C when he was given the contaminated imported factor VIII blood products.

Jonathan died when his son was only four.

Now, aged 34, Jason has spent his life campaigning for justice for his dad, as well as the some 30,000 people who needed the help of the NHS to stay alive and well, but were given treatment that wrecked their health.

The scandal, which has claimed the lives of at least 3,000 people – and will be responsible for more deaths to come – was inflamed by a “chilling” NHS and government cover-up, the prime minister said this week.

"“It’s time for change,” said Keir Starmer, the leader of Britain’s opposition Labour Party, as a surprise early general election was announced for July by prime minister Rishi Sunak.

Starmer goes into the contest widely expected to emerge as PM, despite being roughly as personally popular as Ed Miliband was at the time of the 2015 election, when the Conservatives won a majority.

Headline polls suggest Labour will win a convincing majority in July, with the party 20 points ahead, potentially enough for a landslide victory.

Sunak finally decided to name the date after claiming inflation was back under control and the economy was improving, saying it was “the moment for Britain to choose its future”.

“I hope that my work since I became prime minister shows that we have a plan and are prepared to take bold action necessary for our country to flourish,” he said while speaking from outside No 10 Downing Street during heavy rain.

Starmer subsequently held a press conference, saying that: “A vote for Labour is a vote for stability - economic and political, a politics that treads more lightly on all our lives; a vote to stop the chaos. It’s time for change.”

Rishi Sunak announced the vote for 4 July – a Thursday as is traditional – just inside the second half of the year, as he promised, in a high-risk move for the Tory party as it trails 20 points behind Labour in the polls.

Sunak was previously thought likely to wait until the autumn and a further tax-cutting budget before holding a contest when so far behind, but government insiders suggested he had been convinced that with the economic backdrop unlikely to improve significantly before then, and questions over the delivery of his Rwanda deportation scheme, he would be better off going now.

"A British man has died and dozens more have been injured after a flight from London to Singapore was hit by severe turbulence.

Passengers onboard the Singapore Airlines plane told of a “dramatic drop” that launched those not wearing a seatbelt into the cabin ceiling.

“During the few seconds of the plane dropping there was an awful screaming and what sounded like a thud,” said Andrew, a passenger onboard the Singapore Airlines flight to BBC 5 Live.

Andrew, who said passengers were being kept in a special part of the Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok where the plane was diverted, added that once the turbulence had settled he helped a woman “screaming in agony” who had a “gash on her head”.

The deceased passenger was a 73-year-old British man who had a heart condition, the general manager of Airports of Thailand Kittipong Kittikachorn has confirmed. He was travelling with his wife, who has been taken to hospital.

"The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court has said he is seeking arrest warrants for senior Hamas and Israeli officials for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his defence minister, Yoav Gallant.

The ICC prosecutor's office also said on Monday it had requested arrest warrants for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas chief in the Gaza Strip, Mohammed Deif, the commander of its military wing, considered to be the masterminds of the 7 October assault, and Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the group’s political bureau who is based in Qatar.

""Those who do not comply with the law should not complain later when my office takes action based on solid evidence,” said prosecutor Karim Khan.

“Today, we underline in the clearest possible fashion that international law and the laws of armed conflict apply to everyone. No foot soldier, no commander, no civilian leader - no one - can act with impunity,” he added.

Senior figures in the Israeli government have reacted angrily to the announcement. Israel’s foreign minister Israel Katz said the move was “scandalous” and tantamount to attacking the victims of 7 October.

Israel is also facing a South African case in the international court of justice accusing Israel of genocide. The ICJ only hears cases between states, so it has no jurisdiction over Hamas.

Khan, the British ICC prosecutor, must request the warrants for the Hamas and Israeli suspects from a pre-trial panel of three judges, who take on average two months to consider the evidence and determine if the proceedings can move forward.

"The hardline Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, has died in a helicopter crash in foggy weather in the mountains near the border with Azerbaijan.

The charred wreckage of the helicopter, which crashed on Sunday carrying Raisi, as well as the foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and six other passengers and crew, was found early on Monday after an overnight search in blizzard conditions.

Fears had been growing for Raisi, a 63-year-old ultraconservative, after contact was lost with the aircraft on Sunday as it navigated fog-covered mountains in north-west Iran. Iranian state media blamed bad weather for the crash and said it was complicating rescue efforts.

The country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme – said the country’s first vice-president, Mohammad Mokhber, would take over as interim president. Under Iran’s constitution, a new presidential election must be held within 50 days.

Raisi was a hardliner who formerly led the country’s judiciary. He was viewed as a protege of Khamenei, and some analysts had suggested that he could replace the 85-year-old leader.

He won Iran’s 2021 presidential election, for which the turnout was the lowest in the Islamic Republic’s history. Raisi was under sanctions by the US in part over his involvement in the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 at the end of the bloody Iran-Iraq war.

"The first thing Marc Conway did after being one of the people who chased and held down the London Bridge terrorist attacker in 2019 wasn’t to call his mum or his girlfriend to let them know he was safe – it was to call his probation officer.

He says this was because he was terrified that his actions to protect the public could land him back in prison.

Conway, an ex-offender who now campaigns for fairness and justice in prison, is one of a few thousand people in the UK who live under an IPP – imprisonment for public protection, otherwise known as an indeterminate sentence.

IPPs were introduced in 2005 and last year a UN torture expert expressed concerns that the sentences had the potential to be “inhuman and degrading”. 90 out of the 8,000 people initially sentenced to IPPs have taken their own lives.

Although IPPs were abolished in 2012 – after the European court of human rights ruled they were ""arbitrary and unlawful"" – they were not abolished retrospectively, meaning thousands are still serving these sentences.

And while IPP prisoners are automatically referred to the Parole Board to have their licences considered for termination after 10 years of being released – with a bill being debated in the House of Lords to reduce this to three – they can remain on licence for 99 years.

More than half of the 2,796 people on IPP sentences have been recalled, many over minor breaches of their licences rather than for committing new crimes.

“My anxiety is through the roof,” says Conway, who says his health has suffered from being under an IPP sentence. “I have seriously high blood pressure. I’m on the strongest medication you can get for that. And I’ve been on tablets for depression since I’ve been out, which I’d never been before”.

What will it mean to him to have his licence terminated? “I think my blood pressure will instantly drop.”

"“It’s our escape”

Mohammad Khader, 25, is the founder of @free.gaza.circus, which was founded in 2018.

The non-profit organisation says its mission is to spread happiness and laughter despite the grim circumstances faced by the people of Gaza.

“When we present circus acts we feel free … The aim is to alleviate post-traumatic symptoms among children and the community,” says Khader.

More than 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli offensive that began in response to the 7 October attacks by Hamas on southern Israel, which killed about 1,200 people.

Before the war, Free Gaza Circus provided training workshops aimed at spreading the art and culture of the circus, but the Free Gaza Circus’s centre has now been destroyed in Israeli airstrikes and most of its staff have been displaced.

Despite this, they continue to perform and hold activities in refugee camps in Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by war have been sheltering.

The conversation about the social impact of female-sounding voice assistants isn’t new.

It is an attack on the state itself,” said Slovakia’s interior minister, Matúš Šutaj-Eštok after the country’s prime minister was put in a “life-threatening” and “serious” condition after being shot multiple times.

Robert Fico underwent hours of surgery after being shot five times on Wednesday in the town of Handlová, about 90 miles (150km) north-east of the capital, Bratislava. Fico was conscious while being transported to the hospital, a hospital spokesperson said. A suspect was arrested at the scene and taken into custody.

Late on Wednesday the deputy prime minister, Tomáš Taraba, told the BBC he believed the operation had gone well. “I guess in the end he will survive,” Taraba said, adding: “He’s not in a life-threatening situation at this moment.”

Šutaj-Eštok said initial information “clearly points to a political motivation”. On Thursday morning, local media reported the suspect has been charged with attempted murder.

The attack, which came as Europe prepares for elections in June and amid a rise in attacks on politicians, was widely condemned by European leaders.

More than half of the allegations are from women who said they were under 18 at the time of the incidents. Some said they were as young as 15, although he may not have known their ages.

The allegations against him include claims that he drugged three women before he had sexual relations with them, which they felt they were unable to consent to.

The claims against the 67-year-old illusionist – which he has denied – span from the late 1980s to 2014.

The Guardian US is examining these allegations as part of a series of stories that has drawn on interviews with more than 100 people and court and police records.

Asked about the claims, Copperfield denied wrongdoing of any kind.

His lawyers told the Guardian that he has “never acted inappropriately with anyone, let alone anyone underage”. They said a “truthful” depiction of Copperfield would describe his “kindness, shyness and treatment of men and women with respect”.

They said Copperfield is a champion of the #MeToo movement, which has encouraged women to come forward and tell their stories of alleged abuse.

"‘We are seeing patients who have been burned from the skin right down to the bone,’ says Dr Omar El-Taji, a British surgeon in one of Gaza’s largest remaining hospitals as Israel’s invasion of Rafah deepens.

Officials estimate that as many as 500,000 people have fled Rafah since being told to evacuate by the IDF before their first attacks in and around the city a week ago, while continuing airstrikes and hospitals being forced to evacuate have already strained medical facilities in the south of the Gaza Strip.

El-Taji, a urology specialist at Health Education North West, has been in Gaza for more than a week with medical nonprofit @fajrscientificus working out of the European Hospital in Rafah, which was founded by UNRWA with a grant from the EU. Tens of thousands of refugees are sheltering at the hospital, as well as El-Taji, after Rafah was evacuated. He and his team were due to fly out on Monday, but have been unable to leave since the border closed.

There, with dwindling resources and fewer local staff, remaining medical staff have been working day and night to support patients – from babies to the elderly – who have been rushed to the hospital with devastating injuries.

‘These people have gone through this for six to seven months now, They cannot go through this any more’, says El-Taji. ‘Please let this war stop.’

Only a third of Gaza’s 36 hospitals and primary health care centres are working and all face acute shortages of basic medical supplies, fuel and manpower. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that southern Gaza’s medical operations could soon run out of fuel.

Israel’s military offensive in the Gaza Strip, triggered by surprise attacks launched by Hamas on 7 October in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and about 250 hostages were taken, has killed at least 35,173 Palestinians and wounded 79,061.

The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has so far rejected US pressure to hold off on a full-scale attack of Rafah, and claimed the area is the last stronghold of Hamas, and that Israel can only achieve its war aims by killing militants and leaders in the city.

"In September 2022, Kharkiv province was the site of the greatest Ukrainian victory of the war so far: the lightning counteroffensive that liberated at least 12,000 square kilometres from Russian control, pushed Moscow’s artillery out of range of Kharkiv city and provided real hope that Vladimir Putin could not just be slowed down, but defeated.

Over the past few days, however, Kharkiv has been the location of a very different shift. This time, it is the Russians who have made larger daily advances than at almost any other point in the war, and are now moving further forwards.

Civilians who had come home are fleeing once more in their thousands, and even Kyiv admits that the situation is ‘difficult’.

The students say they are voicing their opposition to what they describe as their university’s “complicity” in Israel’s assault on Gaza that has so far killed more than 34,900 people.

Many want universities to sell off shares, assets or other investments in companies linked to Israel and its war in Gaza, a move known as divestment.

The protesters are also calling for a ceasefire, for universities to class the conflict in the besieged Palestinian territory as a “genocide” and for them to “condemn the destruction of all of Gaza’s universities”.

Thousands of protesters gathered in Malmö's central square Stortorget, about 7km (4.3 miles) from the competition venue, to protest against Israel's participation in the competition.

Pro-Palestinian protesters have accused the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) of double standards. It disqualified Russia from Eurovision in 2022, saying the country’s inclusion would “bring the competition into disrepute”.

The EBU has defended its decision to allow Israel to compete, saying Eurovision is “a non-political music event” and “not a contest between governments”.

Israel was allowed to compete this year after it agreed to modify the lyrics of its entry, a ballad widely understood to be a reference to the Hamas massacre on 7 October, which was was barred by the EBU for breaking rules on political neutrality.

Protests also continued inside the contest this week, as the Israeli singer Eden Golan was booed by members of the audience during dress rehearsals on Wednesday. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, later released a statement praising the singer for “successfully facing a wave of antisemitism while standing and representing the state of Israel with respect”.

The Swedish semi-final performer Eric Saade, whose father is a Palestinian from Lebanon, wore a keffiyeh around his wrist while performing his 2011 Eurovision entry Popular on Tuesday. The EBU later said he had compromised “the non-political nature of the event”.

"“I’m relieved that I do not have children, knowing what the future holds.""

Climate researchers have for decades dedicated themselves to painting a picture of the possible worlds ahead. Even in 1988, the United Nations was concerned that global heating could “be disastrous for mankind if timely steps are not taken at all levels”, so it convened thousands of experts in all fields to sit on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Their task was to produce comprehensive reports, reviews and recommendations, which it has now done six times over 35 years. In terms of scale and significance, it may be the most important scientific endeavour in human history.

These experts are, in short, the most informed people on the planet on climate.

What they think matters.

So the Guardian contacted every available lead author or review editor of all IPCC reports since 2018. Almost half replied – 380 out of 843, a very high response rate.

The scientists’ responses to the survey provide informed opinions on critical questions for the future of humanity. How hot will the world get, and what will that look like? Why is the world failing to act with anything remotely like the urgency needed? Is it, in fact, game over, or must we fight on? 

They also provide a rare glimpse into what it is like to live with this knowledge every day.

"Drake and Kendrick Lamar’s diss-track feud has brought attention to allegations of domestic violence and sex abuse – but for the wrong reasons, writes @guardian_us columnist Tayo Bero.

“These men are casually rapping about child sex abuse, domestic abuse and harboring secret children that they’ve presumably known about for years, but only chose to reveal when they were fighting,” writes Bero.

“The track records of these men show that they were fine being custodians of silence when speaking out did not serve their agendas.”

Lamar addresses Drake’s alleged history of disturbing and inappropriate behavior with minors on his diss tracks Meet the Grahams and Not Like Us, while Drake has revived years-old domestic violence accusations against Lamar on Family Matters, writes Bero.

Both men have denied any wrongdoing.

“When it comes to victimizing women, men rarely call each other out unless it’s convenient or beneficial to do so,” Bero writes.

"A British toddler has had her hearing restored after becoming the first person in the world to take part in a pioneering gene therapy trial, in a development that doctors say marks a new era in treating deafness.

Opal Sandy was born unable to hear anything due to auditory neuropathy, a condition that disrupts nerve impulses travelling from the inner ear to the brain and can be caused by a faulty gene.

But after receiving an infusion containing a working copy of the gene during groundbreaking surgery that took just 16 minutes, the 18-month-old can hear almost perfectly and enjoys playing with toy drums.

Her parents were left “gobsmacked” when they realised she could hear for the first time after the treatment. “I couldn’t really believe it,” Opal’s mother, Jo Sandy, said. “It was … bonkers.”

More deaf children from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will all be followed up for five years.

Prof Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at Cambridge university hospitals NHS foundation trustand chief investigator for the trial, said the initial results were “better than I hoped or expected” and could cure patients with this type of deafness.

He added: “There’s been so much work, decades of work … to finally see something that actually worked in humans …. It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really. It felt very special.”

"Is Germany really the recycling champion of Europe?

The country is famed as a world leader in recycling, and Kiel – a port city in northern Germany which our Europe environment correspondent, Ajit Niranjan, visited – has some of the most weird and workable plans in the country to deal with its rubbish, including using discarded hair from hairdressers as fabrics to filter oil from water.

"“These sisters knew what their rights were and it enraged the kingdom, which wants women to be quiet, sit in their place and celebrate the crumbs they are given,” says Bissan Fakih, Amnesty International’s campaigner on Saudi Arabia, about the Otaibi sisters.

“Despite the image of progress they are trying to project internationally, their fate is indicative of how Saudi Arabia really treats women who dare to ask for their freedoms,” she continues.

Fakih is referring to the fate of Fawzia, Maryam and Manahel al-Otaibi, popular women’s rights advocates in Saudi Arabia who have been outspoken about ending male guardianship rules and giving women the right to travel and work freely.

Manahel was secretly sentenced to 11 years in prison by an anti-terrorism court after being arrested for “her choice of clothing and support for women’s rights”.

Among other charges, she was accused by Saudi authorities of using a hashtag that translates as #societyisready to call for an end to male guardianship rules.

Fawzia was accused of similar offences but was able to flee Saudi Arabia before she could be arrested.

Saudi officials confirmed in a statement to the UN last week that Manahel had been sentenced for what the Saudi government called “terrorist offences”.

Fawzia has now moved to the UK to live in Edinburgh. It is a city Manahel has always wanted to live in but has never visited, Fawzia says. “She read about it in so many books, about the friendly people, the scenery and the history.”

Fawzia says international pressure could help to get Manahel released, “because Saudi Arabia really cares about what people from outside the country say”. She says the regime is fearful about this and is using her family to put pressure on her not to speak out, saying her sisters would be punished for it.

"Footage shows massive destruction in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul after heavy rains devastated the region.

Storms have affected almost two-thirds of the state’s 497 municipalities, with at least 75 people known to have died, over 100 people still missing and more than 80,000 had been displaced in the flooding, according to the state’s civil defence authority.

This part of South America is no stranger to major rainfall; Rio Grande do Sul has experienced flooding three other times in the past year.

This is because the polar and tropical regions of the atmosphere meet around this latitude, resulting in a zone of high pressure that delivers long periods of dry weather punctuated with heavy bursts of rain.

However, this event has been particularly devastating, with experts attributing the heightened rainfall to the combination of global heating and the recent El Niño phenomenon, during which waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer.

"After having vowed for weeks to push into Gaza’s southern border town of Rafah, Israeli forces say they have taken control of the Palestinian side of Rafah crossing – a key strategic objective and the sole gateway between Egypt and Gaza for humanitarian aid.

“At the moment we have operational control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing,” an Israeli military official said on Tuesday morning.

“The operation is not over … I can’t give a timeline,” he added.

The Israeli military also said late on Monday that it was conducting targeted strikes against Hamas in Rafah. The city’s Kuwaiti hospital said on Tuesday that 11 people had been killed and dozens of others injured in the strikes.

Israel had earlier called for Palestinians in several neighbourhoods in eastern Rafah to evacuate before a ground excursion, triggering an exodus of thousands of people.

The Israeli operation is taking place before a fresh round of indirect negotiations on a ceasefire in Cairo, and after Hamas announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari ceasefire proposal.

Israeli officials said the terms did not meet its “core demands”, but that they would send a delegation for further talks.

"“I’m living in a country where lots of people see me as an enemy of the state,” says Can Dündar – one of six journalists who have been exiled from their countries that we spoke to to mark World Press Freedom day on Friday.

According to an annual index published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) this week, political attacks on press freedom, including the detention of journalists, suppression of independent media outlets and widespread dissemination of misinformation, have significantly intensified in the past year.

The World Press Freedom Index ranks 180 countries on the ability of journalists to work and report freely and independently.

In a year when more than half the world’s population will go to the polls in democratic elections, the RSF’s index shows an overall decline in press freedom globally and a steep rise in the political repression of journalists and independent media outlets.

Threats from the state have led many journalists across the world to flee their home countries to report from elsewhere. But for many the intimidation did not stop when they left.

"“The government has a moral duty to look after these people,” said one protester, as hundreds of demonstrators blocked the road near a hotel in south London in a successful attempt to stop asylum seekers who were staying there from being collected and moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge.

At least eight asylum seekers living at a Best Western in Peckham were told a week ago that they would be collected on Thursday morning and relocated to the Bibby Stockholm, moored at Portland in Dorset.

The coach was expected to collect other passengers along the way, but it was blocked by protesters after pulling in at a bus stop at about 8am.

The people due to be removed were said to include teenagers attending colleges in the area. A number of men staying at the hotel said they feared the conditions that would await them on the Bibby Stockholm, where an Albanian man, Leonard Farruku, died last year in a suspected suicide.

One said: “We are also concerned this is happening at the same time as the government’s Rwanda plans have gone through. But it’s encouraging to see this sort of support.”

Forty-five people were arrested for offences including obstruction of the highway, obstructing police and assault on officers, according to the Met.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “This behaviour is intimidatory and aggressive. As part of our commitment to significantly reduce the use of hotels, asylum seekers are being moved into alternative accommodation to reduce costs on the taxpayer.

“We have returned 150 hotels to local communities and we work closely with accommodation providers to manage the exit process in a way which limits the impact on local authorities and asylum seekers.”

"Blackpool’s verdict looks like an “electoral death sentence for the Conservative government” writes political analyst Lewis Baston, as the Tories are predicted to lose up to half of their seats in the local election - the worst local election results in 40 years.

Labour has won the ‘red wall’ Blackpool South byelection, marking the third biggest swing from the Conservatives to the party in postwar history.

British political scientist Sir John Curtice told the BBC’s Today programme that the Tory party seemed to be on course for “one of the worst, if not the worst Conservative performance in local government elections for the last 40 years”.

Asked if that result would be “catastrophic” for the party, Curtice said: “Not far short of it.”

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, hailed the result as “seismic” on a night of local election results that provided further evidence that his party looks to be heading for a large majority at this year's general election.

"”I’m here because my music, my dancing, my acting, the way my body moves in front of the camera and the way my voice resonates through a microphone is not by chance,” FKA twigs said to a US Senate Judiciary subcommittee.

On Tuesday, the singer told Congress that AI can be used as a creative and commercial tool - but said - that without regulation it could exploit creators, as third parties can take musicians ‘art and identity’ without consent.

The use of AI to impersonate the voices and images of well-known singers and rappers has been growing.

In early April, a group of more than 200 high-profile musicians, including Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder and Nicki Minaj, signed an open letter calling for protections against the predatory use of artificial intelligence that mimics human artists’ likenesses, voices and sound.

FKA twigs also told the senate that she’s using AI to create a deepfake version of herself to interact with fans and journalists so she can focus on her music. Watch the video to hear twigs explanation for why AI use in this way can be ‘a meaningful tool’ for artists.

"While international attention has been turned toward Gaza, violence against Palestinians has increased in the West Bank too. Israeli settler attacks have become more frequent.

Guardian US data editor Mona Chalabi visualized this rising violence.

“For decades, Israeli settlers have violently stolen Palestinian land with impunity but in recent months, their attacks have increased,” Mona said.

“The Israeli military often supports these attacks, the Israeli police rarely prosecute them and the United States rarely condemns them.”

Settlers are Israeli citizens who live on Palestinian land. In most cases, this happens because Palestinians are prevented from accessing their land and are physically attacked by settlers. In a third of cases, Palestinian property is damaged by settlers.

“Settlers attacked us, destroying our homes, water tanks, solar panels and cars,” Abu Khaled, 43, told the UN after being displaced on 28 October.

“I felt the presence of death so tangibly as if I saw it with my own eyes … I made the hardest decision in my life: to leave Zanuta and leave everything behind, as memories. I did this to protect my children.”

The numbers, collected by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), are incomplete. The organization notes that “cases of harassment, trespass, and intimidation are not included in these statistics when they do not result in damage or casualties, although they, too, increase the pressure on Palestinians to leave”.

"A Russian missile hit a gothic-style building, known locally as the ‘Harry Potter castle’, in the Ukrainian southern port city of Odesa.

At least five people were killed and more than 30 injured in the attack.

Footage released by Ukrainian authorities showed emergency services trying to control a blaze as smoke rose from the building that housed a private law academy.

The building is also reportedly the residence of the prominent former MP Serhiy Kivalov, who was among those said to have been injured in the strike.

Odesa is one of Ukraine’s biggest ports and has long been a target of Russian attacks, especially after Moscow quit a UN-brokered deal that had allowed safe passage for Ukrainian grain shipments via the Black Sea.

Ukrainian officials have said Russia is assembling forces for a major summer offensive, despite its troops making only incremental gains in recent months.

The Nato chief, Jens Stoltenberg, has said countries have failed to deliver military aid to Ukraine in time, benefiting Russia on the frontline.

"Warning: this video and caption contain discussions of online image abuse and suicide

“I'm doing this not just for myself, but for the hundreds of millions of people out there. Some of them have already lost their lives because of this. But as long as I breathe and I am still here, I will keep on fighting.”

Four years ago, Breeze Liu, the founder of the facial recognition tool Alecto AI, opened her phone to find out that a nude video of her had been shared without her consent – a video that then spawned hundreds of deepfake pornography links.

“It’s like a part of me has permanently died,” she says. At one point, she considered killing herself.

Last year’s State of Deepfakes report revealed a sixfold increase in deepfake pornography in the year to 2023: 98% of deepfake videos online were found to be pornographic, while women were the victims in 99% of recorded cases.

While countries such as the UK have taken steps towards criminalising the creation of deepfakes, for Liu, this is as much about holding big tech companies accountable as it is about legal change.

For years, Liu felt shamed, silenced and blocked from seeking justice. But now she has built an AI tool to challenge the tech industry to do better – and to try to make sure what happened to her doesn’t happen to anyone else.

That’s if the country’s declining birth rate continues at its current course.

On average, women in South Korea are now having only 0.72 children - according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea, a government-affiliated body. For a country to have a stable population, that number needs to be a little over 2.

It’s been called a ‘national emergency’ and the South Korean government has made it a priority to reverse the falling fertility rate - they have even spent $270bn in incentives to encourage couples to have more children.

"“We as American Jews will not be used, we will not be complicit and we will not be silent. Judaism is a beautiful, thousands-year-old tradition, and Israel is a 76-year-old colonial apartheid state,” Morgan Bassichis, an organizer with Jewish Voice for Peace, told the crowd.

Hundreds of Jewish anti-war demonstrators have been arrested during a Passover seder, a ceremonial meal that takes place at the start of the Jewish holiday, that doubled as a protest in New York.

They shut down a major thoroughfare to pray for a ceasefire and urge th Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, to end US military aid to Israel.

The 300 or so arrests took place on Tuesday night at Grand Army Plaza, on the doorstep of Schumer’s Brooklyn residence, where thousands of mostly Jewish New Yorkers gathered for the seder, a ritual that marked the second night of the holiday celebrated as a festival of freedom by Jews worldwide.

The seder came just before the US Senate resoundingly passed a military package that includes $26bn for Israel.

“This is the Passover that we take our exodus from Zionism. Not in our name. Let Gaza live,” Bassichis said.

Speakers included journalist and author Naomi Klein, Palestinian activist Linda Sarsour, and several Jewish students suspended from Columbia University and Barnard College over the protests that have rocked US campuses in recent days.

Naomi Klein wrote a piece for the Guardian yesterday. “Zionism is a false idol that has taken the idea of the promised land and turned it into a deed of sale for a militaristic ethnostate,” she writes.

“[Zionism] is a false idol that takes our most profound biblical stories of justice and emancipation from slavery – the story of Passover itself – and turns them into brutalist weapons of colonial land theft, roadmaps for ethnic cleansing and genocide.”

"Clouds of dust blown in from the Sahara covered Athens and other Greek cities on Tuesday, one of the worst such episodes to hit the country since 2018, officials said.

A yellow-orange haze smothered several regions after days of strong winds from the south, limiting visibility and prompting warnings from the authorities of breathing risks.

Authorities warned that the dust concentrations can reduce sunlight and visibility while increasing concentrations of fine pollution particles, posing risks for people with underlying health problems.

Greece had already been struck by Sahara dust clouds in late March and early April which also smothered parts of Switzerland and southern France.

The Sahara releases 60 to 200m tonnes of mineral dust a year. While the largest particles come rapidly back down to earth, the smallest can travel thousands of kilometres, potentially reaching all of Europe.

"Five people, including a child, have died in an attempt to cross the Channel, the morning after Rishi Sunak’s government passed legislation to allow it to deport asylum seekers who arrive in the UK on small boats to Rwanda.

“The government wants us to see them all as 'illegal migrants'. To dehumanise them so they are not seen as men, women, children, fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters,” said Enver Solomon, chief executive of Refugee Council, reacting to the news of the vote.

The Rwanda bill passed after the government overrode the supreme court's unanimous judgment that the Rwanda policy is unlawful, and with new legislation making it significantly harder to bring successful individual challenges.

Sunak said the first flights removing asylum seekers to Rwanda were planned to depart in 10 to 12 weeks, and pledged “multiple flights a month, through the summer and beyond”.

But leaked documents suggest that in the first year the government intends to send as few as 500 people to Kigali, and that accommodation that was to be used has now apparently been sold off.

The deal will cost £1.8m for each of the first 300 deportees, the National Audit Office has said.

Solomon said: “The government still expects us to believe that as soon as a flight does take off … a magical deterrent effect will immediately kick in, and the boats will stop coming. Yet the evidence from organisations working with refugees and researchers all points in the opposite direction.""

“They should be treated with dignity, respect and humanity: their asylum claims processed fairly, in a timely fashion on UK soil,” Solomon added.

The baby weighed 1.4kg and was delivered in an emergency caesarean section. The head of the neonatal unit, Dr Mohammad Salama, said she was in a stable condition and gradually improving.

The baby’s grandmother Mirvat al-Sakani told Associated Press that she would take care of her.

“She is a memory of her father,” Sakani said. “My son was also with them. My son became body parts and they have not found him yet. They have nothing to do with anything. Why are they targeting them? We don’t know why, how? We do not know.”

More than half of Gaza's 2.3 million people have crowded into Rafah, seeking shelter from Israeli bombardment. Israel is threatening a ground offensive into the southern part of the strip, where the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said Hamas fighters must be 'eliminated'.

"“Both sides are playing with fire,” Peter Beaumont, a senior Guardian international reporter, writes in a piece on where Iran and Israel’s relationship is heading after the recent attacks.

On Friday, US officials confirmed that Israel had carried out strikes against Iran. Explosions were reported in the sky over the city of Isfahan, and air defence systems were activated elsewhere in the country.

The Iranian government sought to play down the scale of the attack, andan Iranian official indicated that it had no “immediate” plan for retaliation.

The attack came less than a week after Iran fired more than 300 missiles and drones at Israel in response to an Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria that killed seven Iranian officials on 1 April.

Since those Iranian strikes, which were largely intercepted, Israel has been weighing its response amid strong pressure from the US and other western supporters to avoid a further dangerous escalation.

While Friday’s attack is far from the first time that Israel has sought to hit Iran and Iranian interests, this time it has occurred in the midst of a period of intensive scrutiny. Swipe to read Peter‘s analysis on the situation - and for our latest reporting on this story, click the link in bio.

"US officials have confirmed that Israel has carried out airstrikes against Iran, with explosions being reported in the sky over the cities of Isfahan and Tabriz.

Initial reports suggested at least three explosions occurred above the central city of Isfahan, which hosts facilities for the country’s nuclear programme, weapons factories and a large airbase.

The US told the G7 foreign ministers on Friday that it received “last minute” information from Israel about a drone action in Iran.

Iranian officials have referred to the incident as an attack by “infiltrators”, rather than by Israel. The government also sought to play down the scale of the attack, with a senior commander in Iran’s army saying there was no damage in Isfahan, according to state TV.

A senior Iranian official told Reuters that the government has no plans for any immediate retaliation against Israel.

"Imagine if we could replace the plastic packaging we see in shops and that’s delivered to our homes, with a sustainable, compostable alternative?

Couple Julia Marsh and Matt Mayes founded @swaythefuture to try and do just that, using seaweed.

“Plastic comes from petroleum, so everyday when you open up your snack wrapper or you receive your Amazon order, it’s coming packaged in plastic which comes from fossil fuels,” says Marsh.

Using lots of different types of farmed seaweed, Sway have created a plastic pellet which is designed to fit into current manufacturing systems where plastic is used. They have also developed a clear plastic film which can be used to replace very common parts of packaging that are the least likely to be recycled.

“It’s not hard for brands to switch to our material because it works in the systems they already use,” says Marsh.

Marsh, who is a designer by trade, says she spent years designing packaging and making “beautiful trash”, something which didn’t match up with her love of the ocean.

She looked at many of the existing plastic alternatives, and saw shortcomings which hindered them from working in the mainstream.

“I think replacements for plastic should go even further, I think they should do good,” she says.

Here, Marsh explains exactly how they make seaweed plastic, how this plastic replacement can benefit the oceans and environment, and if you can eat it.

"Authorities in Indonesia have issued a tsunami alert after Mount Ruang erupted five times in two days, spewing a column of smoke more than 2km into the sky.

Officials worry that part of the stratovolcano in the province of North Sulawesi could collapse into the sea and cause a tsunami, as happened in 1871. 

Authorities have been rushing to evacuate 11,000 residents from nearby areas, including the remote island of Tagulandang, home to about 20,000 people.

Volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur frequently in Indonesia due to its position on the Pacific’s Ring of Fire – an arc where tectonic plates collide – which stretches from Japan through south-east Asia and across the Pacific basin.

"“I just want to go home,” is what one passenger said whilst stuck in Dubai international airport after deadly storms hit the United Arab Emirates.

Up to 259.5mm (10.2in) of rain fell on the usually arid country of the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, the most since records began 75 years ago, killing at least 19 people.

The rains began on Monday night, and by Tuesday evening the desert city of Dubai had received the average amount of rain it normally gets in a year.

Passengers crowded around airline desks at Dubai international airport on Wednesday after major delays and cancellations caused by heavy rains.

Although the heavy rains had eased by late Tuesday, disruption was continuing on Wednesday, with Emirates airline suspending check-in for passengers departing from Dubai until midnight.

"Global heating has pushed the world’s coral reefs to a fourth planet-wide mass bleaching event that is on track to be the most extensive on record, US government scientists have confirmed.

Some 54% of ocean waters containing coral reefs have experienced heat stress high enough to cause bleaching, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Coral Reef Watch said.

Coral reefs are rich in biodiversity and provide habitat to a quarter of all marine species while covering less than 1% of ocean area. Reefs provide food and tourism income to millions of people and protect coastlines, but are considered to be one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to global heating.

Scientists are trying to save the world’s coral and a recent study found that underwater speakers that broadcast the hustle and bustle of thriving coral could bring life back to more damaged and degraded reefs that are in danger of becoming ocean graveyards.

"“We just found ourselves in the middle of a fire. Everyone ran back, people were screaming and crying.”

This is how Maha Hussaini described her experience trying to return to the north of the Gaza Strip with her family.

Worried about the possible arrival of Israeli forces in the south, and tired of living in overcrowded shelters, many displaced Palestinians have tried to head north in recent days, after rumours of civilians managing to pass through IDF checkpoints.

But witnesses describe coming under strikes and sniper fire as they attempted to make the journey.

“When we reached the north of Nuseirat, the last point before Gaza City, intense Israeli bombardments began,” said Hussaini, a human rights activist with the organisation EuroMed.

The IDF has not commented on these reports, and has warned people against travelling into what they say is ‘an active war zone’.

Despite intense opposition from its closest allies, Israel has said for weeks it will launch a ground operation into the border town of Rafah, the last corner of the territory that has not seen fierce ground fighting, and where nearly 2 million people are sheltering.

"Police have airlifted a person to safety in Oman, where severe flooding has left at least 18 people dead and caused disruptions across other parts of the Gulf region.

Heavy rain also affected the United Arab Emirates, flooding major highways and disrupting flights at Dubai International airport. At least one person was killed after being swept away in his car in Ras Al Khaimah.

The rain began on Monday night, and by Tuesday evening, Dubai had recorded more than 142mm of rain, about as much as it expects in a year and a half.

Ahmed Habib, a specialist meteorologist, has said the heightened rainfall in the UAE may be attributed to the practice of “cloud seeding”, in which government-operated small aircraft release salt flares into clouds to try to enhance precipitation levels.

The UAE started cloud-seeding operations in 2002 to address water security issues, but the lack of drainage in many areas can trigger flooding.

Human-caused climate breakdown is also contributing to extreme weather across the world, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters.

"Australian police conducted investigations outside the Assyrian Christ the Good Shepherd church, a day after an alleged knife attack at the site that has been declared a terrorist act.

At least four people were wounded in the incident, including Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel, who was allegedly stabbed at the altar of his own church.

A live stream of the service on the church’s website showed a person approaching the altar who then appeared to stab toward the bishop's head multiple times.

Crowds gathered outside the church after the incident and were moved on after police officers were attacked.

The circumstances of the incident – the particular church that was targeted, the nature of the service, the bishop in question, the spread of videos of the attack and aftermath and the existing tensions between the Assyrian Christian and Muslim communities in the area – were an almost perfectly combustible combination.

The NSW premier, Chris Minns, gathered leaders of the local Muslim, Assyrian and Melkite communities for an emergency meeting at 10.30pm on Monday, organising for them to put their names to a statement condemning the violence and calling for calm.

"Authorities in Brussels ordered the closure of a radical right conference that was addressed by British politicians including Nigel Farage and Suella Braverman.

Emir Kir, the mayor of the Saint-Josse-ten-Noode district in Brussels, said an order had been issued banning the National Conservatism conference, which started on Tuesday.

Police entered the conference at the Claridge venue, near the European Quarter, two hours into the event to serve the organisers with a request to close the event down. Police told reporters at the scene that they would not be dragging people out of the venue but would not be letting anyone else in.

The conference features hardline rightwingers from around the world committed to the NatCons' 'faith, flag and family' brand of conservatism.

Among others due to speak at the two-day gathering were Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister and a key ally of Vladimir Putin, as well as French far-right candidate Éric Zemmour.

Also on the speakers list were Rod Dreher, an American writer who argued that the Christchurch mosque gunman who killed 51 people in 2019 did have ‘legitimate, realistic concerns’ about ‘declining numbers of ethnic Europeans’; Ryszard Legutko, a Polish politician who has said he does not ‘understand why anyone should want to be proud of being a homosexual’; and Uzay Bulut, a Turkish political analyst who said that London ‘appears to be a striking case of the Islamisation of a major western capital through mass migration’.

The venue was the conference’s third after others had cancelled bookings. An upmarket venue, Concert Noble, near the European Commission and European parliament pulled the plug on Friday after protests from anti-fascist activists.

"‘Stop the world for Gaza,’ read one sign on San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge as thousands of people held demonstrations across the US on Monday calling for a ceasefire in the war.

The protests were among many demonstrations held around the world since Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory began last year.

After the 7 October attacks on Israel, carried out by Hamas fighters who killed more than a thousand people and took hundreds of hostages, the Israeli government has launched an unrelenting attack on the heavily populated Gaza Strip, killing more than 33,000 people, many of them women and children.

Despite worldwide calls for a ceasefire and an order from the UN’s top court, the international court of justice, to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and ‘prevent and punish the direct and public incitement to commit genocide’, Israel has yet to pull back.

The Israel Defense Forces has continued its military operations and humanitarian aid has been prevented from reaching Gaza, where Palestinians remain at risk of famine and an almost totally destroyed healthcare infrastructure.

"It’s now been over a year since Sudan descended into war, as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly.

The conflict has plunged Sudan into “one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”, according to UN officials, who also warn it may trigger the world’s largest hunger crisis.

The conflict in Sudan has also created the world’s worst displacement crisis, scattering more than 8 million people internally and across Sudan’s borders. Nearly 2 million people have fled into neighbouring countries to escape the fighting, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan.

Even before the fighting broke out, the UN estimated more than 3 million women and girls in Sudan were at risk of gender-based violence. Since the conflict, there have been numerous reports of armed forces using rape as a weapon.

Despite that, the war in Sudan has received minimal attention in the world’s media.

Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik writes: “The “forgotten war” is what it’s called now, when it’s referenced in the international media.

“Little is offered by way of explanation for why it is forgotten, despite the sharpness of the humanitarian situation, the security risk of the war spreading, and the fact that it has drawn in self-interested mischievous players such as the United Arab Emirates, which is supporting the RSF, and therefore extending the duration of the war.

“One of the reasons for this is Gaza and the escalating Middle East conflict, and how they have monopolised global attention and diplomatic bandwidth for the past six months. And another is that for those reporting within Sudan and the few who manage to get in, doing so is difficult and fraught with danger, limiting the output of images and details that can be broadcast consistently to galvanise attention.

“But the rest, I suspect, is down to what to most will seem unremarkable: this is just another African country succumbing to intractable conflict.”

"Today marks a first in American history: a former US president is going on trial for criminal charges.

Donald Trump has entered the courtroom as the first president – current or former – to face a criminal trial, with jury selection beginning Monday in the Manhattan supreme court.

The proceedings also play out against a presidential race in which Trump is the almost certain Republican nominee who regularly bests Joe Biden in head-to-head polls.

The criminal case against Trump stems from an alleged scheme to cover up purported liaisons with adult film star Stormy Daniels and the Playboy model Karen McDougal ahead of the 2016 general election.

Prosecutors say that Trump, who was indicted in spring 2023 on 34 counts of falsifying business records, participated in an alleged “catch-and-kill scheme” through his then lawyer, Michael Cohen. They said that he did so out of concern that the alleged extramarital encounters with Daniels and McDougal could harm Trump’s candidacy.

After Trump won the election, he paid Cohen back with a series of monthly checks.

On Monday, Trump walked into the courtroom behind his defense attorney Todd Blanche, licked his lips and continued with a hunched posture and what appeared to be a scowl.

@wellspringhealthaccess is the only abortion clinic in Wyoming, one of more than a dozen US states that tried to abortion as soon as Roe v Wade was overturned in June 2022

Burkhart decided it was more important than ever to provide abortion care in the state. One month before opening in May 2022, the clinic was set on fire by an anti-abortion protester, which set her back by 11 months.

This was not the first backlash Burkhart has experienced for her work. She spent many years working for Dr George Tiller, one of only a few people who provided later termination of pregnancy in the US. His clinic had been blockaded, bombed and flooded before he was killed by an anti-abortion extremist in 2009.

After his death, Burkhart bought the clinic from Tiller’s widow and re-opened it, where it still stands today in Wichita, Kansas.

Her clinic in Wyoming is able to exist because Burkhart and other abortion rights supporters have been fighting through the courts to keep abortion legal, and the ban was blocked by a judge, pending a trial.

Here Burkhart explains why she does the work she does, and what it’s been like opening her clinic in Wyoming.

"Taiwan’s strongest earthquake in 25 years has rocked the island, killing at least seven people and injuring at least 700.

The quake, given a magnitude of 7.2 by Taiwan’s earthquake monitoring agency and 7.4 by the US, struck close to the popular tourist city of Hualien, on Taiwan’s eastern coast.

Local media reported people were trapped in buildings in the lightly populated town amid aftershocks following the quake, which started at 7.58am, while power outages and landslides were also reported.

The earthquake also sparked initial tsunami warnings in southern Japan and the Philippines, but the forecast was later downgraded. Japan’s meteorological agency has warned that aftershocks, with a similar intensity to those felt in Taiwan, may be likely over the next week.

This is Taiwan’s strongest since 1999, when a 7.6-magnitude quake 93 miles (150 km) south of Taipei killed 2,400 and injured 10,000.",2024-04-03 12:16:20
"'This is a tragedy. Humanitarian aid workers and civilians should never be a target', said World Central Kitchen (WCK), after seven of its workers were killed in an Israeli strike in central Gaza according to the food charity.

‘Despite coordinating movements with the [Israeli army], the convoy was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse, where the team had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza on the maritime route,’ WCK said.

The workers were travelling in two vehicles branded with the charity’s logo, according to a statement released early on Tuesday. WCK said those killed were from the UK, Australia, Poland and Palestine, as well as a US-Canada dual citizen.

Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as 'a tragic case of our forces unintentionally hitting innocent people in the Gaza Strip.'

'This happens in wartime. We are thoroughly looking into it, are in contact with the governments, and will do everything to ensure it does not happen again,' said Netanyahu in a video statement.

The incident has thrown humanitarian relief efforts in the Palestinian territory into chaos as the organisation, which is spearheading efforts to alleviate looming famine in Gaza, said it would suspend operations.

"On a scale of one to 10, how scared of rejection are you?

The soul-crushing embarrassment of being rejected by a stranger is something most of us would want to avoid – but our reporter Joe Stone spent a month embracing it as part of ‘rejection therapy'.

Rejection therapy began as a card game challenging players to inoculate themselves against the fear of rejection by placing themselves directly in its path, and has since risen in popularity on social media.

It has some similarities to exposure therapy – the practice of subjecting a patient to increasing quantities of a thing they fear until they become desensitised – but lacks its clinical basis, says Dr Becky Spelman, a counselling psychologist and clinical director of Private Therapy Clinic.

"Israel’s siege of Gaza has created what aid officials are referring to as “man-made starvation”, with the territory facing the threat of mass deaths from famine in the coming weeks.

Gaza has been under military assault by Israel since Hamas’s attack on 7 October, in which the militant group killed 1,200 people and seized over 250 hostages. An estimated 32,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict – but aid agencies fear that thousands more will die in the coming hunger crisis.

The entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity or worse, – with many of those in “catastrophic need” – warned the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a coalition of UN agencies and aid groups, in a recent report.

This is the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger ever recorded by the IPC, said UN secretary general António Guterres last week.

Aid agencies have accused Israel of deliberately blocking food and aid going into the strip, while the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said on Sunday that Israel had definitively barred it from making aid deliveries in northern Gaza, which faces imminent famine.

Israel says that it allows “extensive” aid to enter and blamed the UN for not delivering aid quickly enough, holding up relief efforts, and Hamas for stealing supplies.

“Here from this crossing, we see the heartbreak and heartlessness of it all,"" said Guterres, visiting Rafah earlier this week. “A long line of blocked relief trucks on one side of the gates, the long shadow of starvation on the other. That is more than tragic. It is a moral outrage.”

"A major bridge in Baltimore in the US state of Maryland has snapped and collapsed after a container ship collided with it early on Tuesday, sending a number of vehicles into the water.

The Baltimore fire department said it was searching for at least seven people believed to be in the water, after reports that a large vessel had crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge.

A video posted on X appeared to show the vessel striking one of the bridge’s central supports, causing much of the 2.6km bridge to give way as a number of vehicles fell into the Patapsco River below. The ship appeared to catch fire as part of the bridge appeared to collapse over it, sending plumes of thick, black smoke into the air.

Calls to 911 had come in at about 1.30am, reporting a vessel travelling outbound from Baltimore that had struck a column on the bridge, causing it to collapse, said Kevin Cartwright, the director of communications for the Baltimore fire department. Several vehicles were on the bridge at the time, including one the size of a tractor-trailer.

The Baltimore mayor, Brandon M Scott, and the county executive, Johnny Olszewski Jr, said emergency personnel were at the scene and rescue efforts were under way.

Built in 1977, the bridge spans the Patapsco River, a vital artery that along with the Port of Baltimore is a hub for shipping on the US’s east coast. It is named for the author of the American national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner.

"Only seven countries are meeting an international air quality standard, with deadly air pollution worsening in places due to a rebound in economic activity and the toxic impact of wildfire smoke, a new report has found.

Of 134 countries and regions surveyed in the report, only seven – Australia, Estonia, Finland, Grenada, Iceland, Mauritius and New Zealand – are meeting a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline limit for tiny airborne particles expelled by cars, trucks and industrial processes.

When inhaled, these particles, PM2.5, can cause a myriad of health problems and deaths.

The most polluted country, Pakistan, has PM2.5 levels more than 14 times higher than the WHO standard, the IQAir report found, with India, Tajikistan and Burkina Faso the next most polluted countries.

Canada, long considered as having some of the cleanest air in the western world, became the worst for PM2.5 last year due to record wildfires that ravaged the country, sending toxic spoke spewing across the country and into the US.

“Unfortunately things have gone backwards,” said Glory Dolphin Hammes, North America chief executive of IQAir. “The science is pretty clear about the impacts of air pollution and yet we are so accustomed to having a background level of pollution that’s too high to be healthy.

"The Princess of Wales has disclosed that she has been diagnosed with cancer and is in the early stages of receiving chemotherapy treatment.

In a statement recorded at Windsor by the BBC, Catherine said her condition had been discovered after she had major abdominal surgery in January.

After weeks of speculation about her health, Catherine said she and her husband, Prince William, had needed time to explain the situation to their three children, George, 10, Charlotte, eight, and Louis, five.

“This of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family,” she said. “As you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But, most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I am going to be OK.”

The Princess of Wales, 42, had been admitted to the London Clinic on 16 January for major abdominal surgery. At the time, the palace refused to confirm what Catherine was being treated for, but said the condition was non-cancerous.

Catherine said it was only after the surgery that the cancer had been found. The king is also currently being treated for cancer.

"Have you ever wondered how the internet travels around the world?

You might think it travels above our heads through the ether, but actually 99% of it is carried undersea by fibre optic cables, according to TeleGeography.

The problem is undersea cables are relatively fragile and can be damaged quite easily- especially when there’s a conflict happening above them.

Experts are worried that the conflict in the Red Sea could damage the world’s internet infrastructure - either accidentally or on purpose.

Yemeni Houthi rebels have been attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea since last November, in response to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza – which began after an unprecedented Hamas attack on 7 October.

"When Arizona state senator Eva Burch learned that her pregnancy was not progressing and decided to have an abortion, Burch and her husband quickly made another decision: Burch was going to speak up about it – from the floor of the state senate.

“My medical provider was forced to tell me multiple things that don't apply to my situation, and some that are just transparently, factually false”, said Burch, describing how she was given disinformation about abortion alternatives after seeking an abortion for her pregnancy which is no longer viable.

"Vladimir Putin has claimed a landslide victory in Russia’s presidential vote, as thousands in the country and around the world protested against his deepening dictatorship, the war in Ukraine and a stage-managed election that could have only one winner.

In a vote denounced by the United States as “obviously not free nor fair”, Putin won 87% of the vote, according to exit polling published by the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Center and the Public Opinion Foundation.

Across the weekend, people in Russia used dye, molotov cocktails and fires to protest at polling booths, while Russians abroad also took part in acts of protest to show their opposition to Putin and the war in Ukraine.

Reports from the ground suggested queues suddenly formed at numerous polling stations across Russia’s big cities, as well as in Europe, as the clock struck midday.

The protest action, labelled 'Noon against Putin', was proposed by the St Petersburg politician Maxim Reznik and endorsed by the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny before his death in an Arctic prison. He called it a safe way for Russians inside and outside the country to congregate publicly and show their opposition to the president.

On Friday, Russian prosecutors threatened any voters who took part in the action with five years in prison, while the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said protesters could face treason sentences of 20 years for destroying voting ballots.

Putin’s election victory extends his 24-year rule until at least 2030. By 2029 his tenure will have surpassed that of Joseph Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union for 29 years, making Putin the country’s longest-serving leader since the Russian empire.

"No country in the world affords women the same opportunities as men in the workforce, according to a new report from the World Bank, which found the global gender gap was far wider than previously thought.

For the first time, the bank investigated the impact of childcare and safety policies on women’s participation in the labor market in 190 countries. It found that when these two factors were taken into account, women on average enjoyed just 64% of the legal protections men do, down from the previous estimate of 77%.

Report author Tea Trumbic said childcare and safety issues particularly affected women’s ability to work. Violence could physically prevent them from going to work, and childcare costs could make it prohibitive.

The 10th edition of the women, business and the law report, published on Monday, also for the first time assessed the gap between laws and the policies put in place to implement them. It found countries had, on average, established less than 40% of the systems needed for full implementation.

“All over the world, discriminatory laws and practices prevent women from working or starting businesses on an equal footing with men,” said Indermit Gill, chief economist of the World Bank Group.

“Closing this gap could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20% – essentially doubling the global growth rate over the next decade – but reforms have slowed to a crawl.”

"“Ibrahima’s whole journey has been suffering on top of suffering.”

Since arriving in the UK, Ibrahima Bah has had little opportunity to speak to people because he has been behind bars.

In 2022 while still a teenager, Bah was forced to steer a dangerous and overcrowded dinghy across the Channel from France to the UK. At least four people drowned during the crossing. Bah told the police the boat journey was “terrifying”, and had taken four days and four nights.

He was held responsible for those deaths in a UK court sentenced to nine years and six months in prison. His conviction of multiple counts of manslaughter last month was made possible by recent changes in the UK law – part of the Conservative government’s clampdown on small boats.

But others think he is a victim.

The right to claim asylum was enshrined in the 1951 Geneva conventions after the horrors of the second world war – and has saved many lives. The UK is still signed up to that convention, but UK law now makes it almost impossible to exercise that essential right.

The Humans for Rights Network and Refugee Legal Support, two of the organisations supporting Bah, says his conviction demonstrates a “violent escalation in the prosecution of people for the way in which they arrive in the UK”.

“Ibrahima navigated a horrific journey to the UK in the hope of finding safety here through the only means available to him and yet he has been punished for the deaths of others seeking the same thing, sanctuary.”

Survivors of the boat disaster said if it hadn’t been for Ibrahima, everyone would have drowned. They called him an “angel,” who tried to save lives and put the welfare of others first.

In his sentencing remarks at Canterbury crown court, the judge said to Bah: “This is also a tragedy for you. Your dream of starting a new life in the UK is in tatters.”

It was taken by Palestinian filmmaker @soliman__farra on Monday. “Every family inside a tent made a group Suhoor, and all the families of the camp gathered in it, despite the bombing and their destroyed homes, looking for joy and still standing,” said Al-Farra.

“I was very happy while taking the photo. I saw the displaced people gathered together and they were happy. Since the beginning of the war, I have not seen such joy for the displaced,” he continued.

More than 31,000 people in Gaza have been killed in the Israeli offensive launched after the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel, according to health authorities in Gaza, who say most of those killed have been women and children.

Israel blames Hamas for the high civilian death toll, saying the militant organisation, which has run Gaza since 2007, uses civilians as human shields. Hamas denies the charge.

Looming over all those trying to celebrate Ramadan in Rafah is the prospect of an imminent attack. Israeli officials say Hamas leaders are based in the city along with four battalions of militants – the only major remaining fighting force of the Islamist organisation.

Though Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, pledged last week to continue to seek “total victory”, he is under intense international pressure to halt Israel’s military operations and allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.

The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has called for a truce in the Israel-Gaza war as the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan begins. He also urged the release of hostages held by Hamas and the removal of ‘all obstacles to ensure the delivery of lifesaving aid at the speed and massive scale required’ to Gaza.

"Can you spot a deepfake?

With about a quarter of the world heading to the polls this year, experts fear that we’re only seeing the beginning of the impact AI deepfakes could have on elections – and that we are vastly underprepared to deal with them.

“The ability to deceive from AI has put the problem of mis- and disinformation on steroids,” said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice-president of Public Citizen, a group that’s been pushing for regulation in the US of the use of AI in politics.

Without clear safeguards or regulation, the impact of AI on the election might come down to what voters can discern as real and not real.

However, a recent study by AI Literacy Lab found that about half of Americans surveyed can’t tell the difference between human and AI-generated text or images, while another study by University College London found that voters cannot reliably detect speech deepfakes.

"“He claimed there wasn’t enough time after going through those listed on the order paper [to call on me]. But I’m not convinced – and, the truth is, he can call on whoever he likes.”

This was Diane Abbott’s response after the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, sparked a fresh row by refusing to allow the veteran MP to ask a question during a heated session of prime minister’s questions today, which was dominated by discussions over a major Conservative donor’s comments about her.

Earlier this week, the Guardian revealed that Frank Hester, the Tory party’s biggest donor, said in 2019 that Abbott made him “want to hate all black women” and that she “should be shot”.

At PMQs, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and Stephen Flynn, the Scottish National party leader in Westminster, both used their questions to raise the controversy, but Hoyle provoked groans in the chamber by ending the 35-minute session without having called on Abbott, who sits as an independent after losing the Labour whip last year.

In a comment piece for the Guardian, Abbott, who is the UK’s longest-serving black MP, said Hester’s remarks left her “upset but not surprised”, given the amount of racist abuse she receives. 

Abbott also accused the Conservatives of aiming to “play the race card” in the general election. To read her full op-ed tap the link in bio.",2024-03-14 02:58:05
"“How low would he have to sink?”

The leader of the Labour party, Keir Starmer, began his address to Rishi Sunak at PMQs today by asking if the ‘prime minister is proud to be bankrolled by someone using racist and misogynist language?’

Sunak is facing scathing criticism for refusing to pay back the £10m major donor Frank Hester gave his party after the Guardian reported on Monday that Hester had said at meetings that seeing Diane Abbott on TV made “you just want to hate all black women”, and that Britain’s longest-serving black MP should be “shot”. 

During PMQs, Sunak said: “The alleged comments were wrong. They were racist. He has rightly apologised for them and that remorse should be accepted.”

On Tuesday night, No 10 called the comments “racist and wrong” after mounting pressure. Earlier in the day, government ministers had suggested Hester’s comments were not related to Abbott’s race and gender.

"Hundreds of people had gathered at a public viewing area to watch Space One’s Kairos rocket launch in the Wakayama region of western Japan.

The plan was for Kairos – an ancient Greek word meaning “the right moment” – to put the satellite into orbit about 51 minutes after takeoff.

But seconds into the launch, the rocket exploded into flames, sending smoke billowing into the remote mountainous region. 

The Tokyo-based company had been attempting to becomethe first Japanese private company to put a satellite into orbit. 

Failures on early attempts to launch a new rocket system are common. But the Space One failure still marks a blow to Japan’s efforts to enter the potentially lucrative commercial satellite launch market.

"How does Vladimir Putin keep staying in power?

Over more than two decades in power, Putin's government has crafted its template for winning elections – and quashing any dissent.

Putin became acting president when Boris Yeltsin resigned on 31 December 1999, and won the election the next year. He has already served as the Russian leader for longer than any other ruler but Joseph Stalin – and later in March, he is expected to sweep the vote to claim his fifth presidential term in stage-managed elections no one doubts he will win.

From puppeteering public opinion through state TV and propaganda, to widespread allegations of vote rigging, as well as the elimination of prominent opposition politicians, such as Alexei Navalny, who died suddenly in an Arctic prison, and jailing Ilya Yashin, the Guardian's Russia correspondent Andrew Roth explains the Kremlin science behind Putin's victories – and why, despite his certainty of success, holding elections is still so significant.

"An amazed Cillian Murphy, a nude John Cena, and a golden Godzilla: this year’s Oscars weren’t short on memorable moments.

Host Jimmy Kimmel opened the night with a monologue that included jokes about Robert Downey Jr’s drug use, the disaster that is Marvel’s Madame Web, and Killers of the Flower Moon’s three-and-a-half hour runtime.

A poignant moment punctuated the jokes: Kimmel brought out members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Workers (IATSE), which refused to cross picket lines during the duelling actors’ and writers’ strikes of last year.

“We were able to make deals because of the people who rallied besides us,” Kimmel said, promising that the people in the room would return the favor when IATSE came to the bargaining table.

The first award of the night, best supporting actress, went to a glowing Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who thanked both god and her publicist. Her emotional speech brought her The Holdovers co-star Paul Giamatti to tears.

Another memorable moment came in the form of the hulking – and naked (but covered up) – John Cena. In a comedy routine that called back the infamous Oscars streaking incident of 1974, Cena wore nothing but an awards envelope to present the award for best costume design. “Costumes are so important,” he deadpanned, before announcing the winner (Holly Waddington for Poor Things).

In a performance of ‘I’m Just Ken’ from Barbie, Gosling, clad in glittered suit and pink gloves, rose out of his chair and joined an army of stetson-wearing Kens on stage, including his co-stars Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa and Kingsley Ben-Adir.

There was one notable appearance from a non-Barbie star however: the Guns N’ Roses guitarist Slash. The legendary axe man joined Gosling on stage for a squealing guitar solo.

In the performance, dancers carried Gosling while large Barbie head cutouts ran across the stage.

"“It’s horrifying and extremely sad to see that two to three people are hanged in Iran every single day, without strong international reactions,” says Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO).

The organisation this week jointly published the 16th Annual Report on the Death Penalty in Iran, along with @ecpm_asso .

@amirymoghaddam suggests that the increase in capital punishment in 2023 came as a reaction to nationwide protests prompted by the death of Mahsa Amini in 2022. The killing of the 22-year-old’s, who was detained allegedly for not wearing a headscarf properly, led to the largest wave of popular unrest for years in Iran.

Amiry-Moghaddam believes the data shows the “Iranian authorities are using the death penalty as an instrument to instil fear in society”.

At least 22 women were executed last year, marking the highest number in the past decade, the report added.

But this isn’t the only way that the Iranian regime has been responding to the “woman, life, freedom” protests.

A UN fact-finding mission on Friday said the regime had carried out widespread and sustained human rights violations against its own people during its brutal suppression of protests in 2022.

Their new report also investigated and corroborated accounts published in the Guardian that female protesters had been specifically targeted because of their gender and were shot at close range in the face, breasts and genitals – actions the report cites as evidence of crimes committed by the state against the civilian population.

This is how two women have described their experience struggling to manage their periods amid Israel’s assault on Gaza. 

Five months into the war, almost everyone trapped in the territory is hungry and there is little access to clean drinking water, sanitation or electricity. And for women the conflict has brought an additional monthly horror as they struggle to manage their menstrual cycle.

Sanitary pads are so hard to find that one girl sheltering in an UNWRA school in Maghazi camp said she had been reduced to washing used pads, so she could use them again.

The UN estimates that nearly 700,000 women and girls in Gaza have menstrual cycles, which they are trying to manage with little privacy or access to pads, toilets or clean water.

Over the last seven days gang fighters have released thousands of inmates from prisons and stormed and laid siege to strategic locations in the capital, Port-au-Prince, including two airports, police stations and a port. Nearly all flights in and out of the country’s main international airport have been cancelled, with gangs launching a renewed assault on the compound on Tuesday.

“Either Haiti becomes a paradise or a hell for all of us,” declared Jimmy Chérizier, a police officer turned gang leader whose nom de guerre is Barbecue.

"‘Tumblemageddon’ is how residents described the scenes as towns in Utah were inundated with tumbleweeds as wind gusts of over 100km/h (65mph) hit the state over the weekend.

The weeds formed piles up to three metres high (10 feet), in some places in South Jordan, which lies south of state capital Salt Lake City.

In America, tumbleweeds are formed by invasive weeds called Russian thistle. Each winter after the plants die, the bushy parts snap off at the roots and blow away, tumbling across the landscape to disperse seeds.

Strong winds damaged city infrastructure, according to ABC4, as well as knocking over trees and damaging roads throughout Utah.

“Luckily, it’s something we can handle,” said Rachel Van Cleave, South Jordan communications manager. “This is not our first tumble-mageddon.”

The incident was not without precedent. In Washington state in 2020, unlucky drivers saw in the new year trapped under a glut of 15ft tumbleweeds, after the plants forced authorities to close a highway in both directions. And in California in 2018 tumbleweeds shut down a whole town.

In 2016 a type of tumbleweed known as “hairy panic” inundated an entire Australian town.

"Defying the Kremlin’s warning of arrests, thousands of mourners gathered in Moscow to bid farewell to the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, two weeks after Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critic died in an Arctic prison.

Crowds of people chanted “Putin is a murderer” and “No to war” as they marched under heavy police presence to the Borisovsky cemetery where Navalny was lowered into the ground on Friday to the strains of Frank Sinatra’s My Way.

The public show of support turned Navalny’s last journey into a rare display of dissent in Russia at a time of unprecedented repression.

Accompanied by loud applause and chants of “Navalny”, the hearse carrying his coffin arrived at the Quench My Sorrows church in the Maryino district, where the late politician used to live before he was poisoned with the Novichok nerve agent in 2020.

Video footage showed mourners throwing flowers at the hearse as it drove away from the church towards the cemetery.

Many of the thousands who came to pay their respects said they understood the risks of attending amid warnings of possible arrests but decided to come anyway.

At least 67 people were arrested during tributes to Navalny across Russia, according to the monitoring group OVD-Info. Human rights experts said those who attended the funeral could be added to a database and possibly punished at a later date.

More than 250,000 people were watching the livestream of the funeral on YouTube that Navalny’s team set up, despite reports that the authorities had interrupted internet access around the church.

"More than a hundred Palestinians were killed in the early hours of Thursday morning, Gaza health officials said, when desperate crowds gathered around aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire, in an incident that the US president, Joe Biden, warned was likely to complicate ceasefire talks.

There were different accounts of how the victims died in the chaos that took place near Gaza City in the north of the strip.

Israel’s military denied shooting into large crowds of hungry people and said most were killed in a crush or run over by trucks trying to escape. Soldiers only fired at a small group that moved away from the trucks and threatened a checkpoint, a spokesperson said.

As the UN security council convened an emergency session on Thursday night, the White House called for the deaths to be “thoroughly investigated” and reminded Israel that it needs to provide basic security in areas of Gaza under its control.

"“What happened is unbelievable even in your worst nightmares.”

Dr Simon Fitzgerald and Dr Osaid Alser, two trauma surgeons living in the US, set up a group chat in January to help guide doctors at the Nasser hospital in southern Gaza on the treatment of civilian trauma patients.

Less than a year ago the hospital in Khan Younis was the base of 10 surgeons and 10 surgical trainees. During Israel’s offensive in Gaza the hospital was left with diminishing staff and without enough resources to treat patients.

In February, Israeli forces began targeting the hospital, saying hundreds of militants were hiding in the hospital and some had posed as medical staff. The IDF said it had arrested more than 100 suspected Hamas militants in the hospital compound. Hamas dismissed the allegations, saying they served as a pretext to destroy the healthcare system. 

Gaza’s hospitals have been a focal point of the four-month-old war between Israel and Hamas. Most of the territory’s hospitals have been put out of action by fighting and lack of fuel, leaving a population of 2.3 million without proper healthcare.

"A New York City medical school plans to be tuition-free for students after a $1bn donation from a wealthy donor.

The Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx borough received the sizable donation from Dr Ruth Gottesman, a 93-year-old former professor at the school.

“I’m happy to share with you that starting in August this year, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine will be tuition free,” Gottesman announced to rapturous applause in a video posted to X on Monday.

The donation is among the largest to date for an educational institution in the US, the Times reported.

Gottesman received the money from her late husband, David Gottesman, who went by Sandy. Sandy Gottesman made his fortune from investing in Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational conglomerate that was built by the billionaire Warren Buffett.

When Gottesman’s husband died in 2022 at the age of 96, he left her a sizable stock portfolio with instructions to “do whatever you think is right with it”, she said to the Times.

“I wanted to fund students at Einstein so that they would receive free tuition,” she said.

Half of Einstein’s most recent class of students are New Yorkers, according to the medical school – 59% are women and the majority are people of color. And Einstein’s students graduate with higher amounts of debt than other medical students at New York City schools.

Gottesman told the Times that she hopes her donation will help alleviate the financial burden graduating students face. She said she also hopes that it makes medical school more accessible to those who could not previously afford it.

Twenty-five years after the publication of the damning Macpherson inquiry report into her son’s murder, the social justice campaigner accuses London’s police force of arrogance and resistance to change.

“It’s soul-destroying to know what could have been – that those with the power to do so didn’t make the changes that would have saved families from so much suffering.”

"Have you ever thought about what happens to the skin of smoked salmon that is sold in restaurants and supermarkets?

It is usually disposed of, or used in fertiliser and biofuel. But in recent years, the fashion industry has followed in the footsteps of the Hezhen and Nivkh Indigenous groups in China and Siberia, starting to making leather from salmon skins.

Isabelle Taylor began making salmon leather when she was at university and lived above a fishmonger. Having studied fashion and being in search of a sustainable solution, she began experimenting with the discarded salmon skins and has created her own method for cleaning and tanning.

She explains that the use of “byproducts as a sustainable solution” can be controversial because it could increase the demand for the fish. But she says that in her case, “if the fishing industry stopped disposing of their skins, I wouldn’t go fishing for more skins. I’d find a different industry where other resources are getting wasted.""

In the case of the much more widespread cow hide, the UK Environmental Investigation Agency EIA said that describing cow hide as a ""byproduct"" was misleading.

“I wouldn't call them byproducts. The margins for the meat industry are quite narrow, so all of the saleable parts of the animal are built into the business model,” said Rick Jacobsen, commodity policy manager at the EIA. Non-meat products account for just under a half a slaughtered cow's weight and can generate up to a quarter of meatpackers’ incomes, according to estimates by Bain & Co, a market research group.

"Motaz Azaiza should have been dead by now. Death stalked the streets of Deir al-Balah where he grew up, long before Israel’s assault on Gaza. There had been close encounters in the past; as a teen he was once shot by an Israeli sniper.

When Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the 7 October Hamas attacks, Azaiza picked up his camera and headed to the frontlines. Despite his clearly marked press vest, in December he narrowly avoided being hit again by Israeli forces.

Israel denies targeting journalists but, according to a group of UN experts, more than 122 journalists and media professionals in Gaza have been killed so far: the deadliest conflict for members of the press in recent history.

Two weeks after being evacuated from Gaza, the 25-year-old Palestinian – who has amassed 18.5 million followers on Instagram – sat down with the Guardian to share his experiences of the war.

In the days leading up to his evacuation, @motaz_azaiza says Israeli drones hovered above his home and he began receiving death threats from unknown numbers. The bombs got closer and louder. “I would lie awake in my bed thinking: ‘Any moment now, I will be next,’” he says. He has lost count of the number of friends he has lost.

Although Azaiza has lived through many Israeli offensives, he says this has been by far the worst. “It’s unlike anything we’ve ever experienced,” he says. Through his lens, the rest of the world was able to witness the devastation in Gaza – often in the form of raw, unfiltered videos of those killed or injured.

“I’m not a celebrity, nor would I ever want to be. Before this, I was a very private person,” says Azaiza.

“I wish people knew me for my art,” he says. Before the war, Azaiza would create portraits of ordinary Palestinians doing everyday things; a fruit seller at the market, a picnic on the beach, children chasing one another down a cobbled street. “I wanted to capture the beauty of my people,” he says.

"The sooty air pollution spewed out by cars, trucks and factories is causing widespread harm to people’s hearts and lungs even with the smallest amounts of exposure, with government regulations still routinely allowing for dangerous risks to public health, two major new studies have found.

There is no safe amount of a microscopic form of airborne pollution known as PM2.5, consisting of tiny particles of soot measuring less than the width of a human hair, for heart and lung health, US researchers found, with even small amounts raising the risk of potentially serious problems.

And at the same time, according to figures from the European Environment Agency in a separate study, approximately 238,000 air pollution deaths could be avoided each year if the EU27 countries actually met World Health Organization guidelines for air pollution.

The new research, from academics looking at 41 European countries, also showed that more than half of the benefits would come from fewer deaths from heart attacks, strokes and type 2 diabetes, as well as lung-cancer.

And they say greater ambition would yield even bigger health outcomes.

"A blueprint is emerging for a second Donald Trump term that is even more extreme for the environment than his first, according to interviews with multiple allies and advisers of the ex-president.

In contrast to a sometimes chaotic first White House term, they outlined a far more methodical possible second presidency for Trump: driving forward fossil fuel production, sidelining mainstream climate scientists and overturning rules that curb planet-heating emissions.

70% of Americans – strikingly, including 50% of Republicans – want meaningful action on the climate crisis. But that isn’t reflected in Republican campaigning.

Trump says he doesn’t believe human activity contributes to global heating, nor that climate change is making extreme weather worse, and is opposed to efforts to boost clean energy.

Biden’s record on climate may be criticised by campaigners but his record in office places him firmly against such Republican views.

The US, the world’s second biggest carbon polluter, would still see its emissions drop under Trump due to previous policies and a market-led shift away from coal to gas as an energy source, but at only half the rate of a second Biden term, according to an analysis by Energy Innovation shared with the Guardian.

This would deal a mortal blow to the global effort to restrain dangerous global heating, with scientists warning that the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half this decade, and eliminate them entirely by 2050, to avoid breaching agreed temperature limits and plunge billions of people into worsening heatwaves, floods and droughts.

"“The Palestinian people only demand respect for their rights. They ask for nothing more. They cannot accept nothing less and nothing else.”

This is what Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN, said at the opening of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearings on Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories.

Mansour held back tears as he appealed to the ICJ judges to help secure a two-state solution “in which the two states live side by side in peace and security”.

Israeli leaders have long disputed that the territories – the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem – are formally occupied on the basis that they were captured from Jordan and Egypt during a 1967 war rather than from a sovereign Palestine.

More than 50 states will present arguments before the ICJ in The Hague until 26 February, after a 2022 request from the UN general assembly for an advisory, or non-binding, opinion on the occupation.

The judges are expected to take several months to deliberate before issuing their opinion.

"“Alexei Navalny was the last beacon of hope for anything to change, and that hope died today”, said Elmira, a Moscow resident, as people came to commemorate the late Russia opposition activist.

Hundreds of mourners gathered in cities across Europe and beyond over the weekend to express their outrage, chanting slogans critical of Vladimir Putin, whom many blame for the activist’s death, and holding up signs calling Putin a “killer” and demanding accountability.

In Russia, some protesters resorted to daring political stunts. In the central city of Izhevsk, supporters hung up a large poster saying “Navalny was killed” in front of the local headquarters of the FSB security services.

More than 350 people have been detained at the impromptu memorial services across 32 Russian cities since the death of Navalny, according to OVD-Info, a group that monitors political repression in Russia.

The death of Navalny, once Vladimir Putin’s most significant political challenger, is a watershed moment for Russia’s shattered pro-democracy movement, which has largely been jailed or driven into exile since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Navalny, 47, died while being held in jail on 16 February at 2.17pm, said his official spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, citing a message from his mother and challenging Russia’s official explanation that he died after a fall at the Arctic penal colony where he was being held

According to a post on X by Yarmysh, Navalny’s mother and his lawyers have since been refused access to see his body.

"Pre-teens are super into skincare right now, but how worried should we be?

If you’ve opened TikTok recently, you may have seen the flood of content of users expressing their irritation at some of gen Alpha’s bad behaviour in beauty shops such as Sephora and poking fun at this generation's ‘obsession’ with multi-step, expensive skincare routines.

But we shouldn’t dismiss this as just a normal part of growing up, says beauty reporter Jessica DeFino.

DeFino, who started off her career as an assistant editor on the Kardashian-Jenner official apps before pivoting towards researching into the impact of the beauty industry, says she feels disturbed when she sees child skincare influencers - but is not surprised.

"Polar bears in Canada’s Hudson Bay risk starvation as the climate crisis lengthens periods without Arctic Sea ice, according to new research carried out by the US Geological Survey (USGS).

The marine mammals use the ice that stretches across the ocean surface in the Arctic during colder months to help them access prey.

But human-caused climate breakdown is extending this ice-free period in parts of the Arctic – which is heating between two and four times faster than the rest of the world – and forcing the polar bears to spend more and more time on land.

New research used video camera GPS collars to track the polar bears for three-week periods over the course of three years in the western Hudson Bay.

“Polar bears are creative, they’re ingenious, they will search the landscape for ways to try to survive and find food resources,” said Anthony Pagano, the lead author of the study.

But the bears’ efforts to find food on land did not provide them with enough calories to match their normal marine mammal prey.

“This is another piece of evidence that really raises that alarm,” said World Wildlife Fund, which is not associated with the study.

The world’s 25,000 polar bears in the wild are endangered primarily by the climate crisis.

Limiting planet-heating greenhouse gases and keeping global heating under the Paris deal target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would be likely to preserve polar bear populations, Pagano said.

But global temperatures are already at 1.2C and they continue to rise as sea ice dwindles.

"Amin Nuru, his wife and their five children live in a one-bedroom flat in Lambeth, London, where the walls have become riddled with damp and black mould.

Doctors told the family they must urgently move out after the couple’s daughter suffered serious illness. But an initial environmental health inspection found that their living situation did not meet the “statutory overcrowded” threshold, and their case for emergency rehousing was closed.

Campaigners have described the living conditions as the “slums of the 21st century” and have called for local councils to do more to help families like Nuru’s.

Since filming this video, Lambeth council carried out a review of Nuru’s case, which concluded that the family’s home falls within the “standard definition of overcrowding”.

"Its walls collapsed and minaret cut short, Gaza’s Omari mosque remains standing but vastly diminished. Around it, the historic old city is also in tatters.

The 7th-century mosque, also known as the Great Mosque of Gaza, was Gaza’s most famous and its surroundings a focal point of the Palestinian enclave’s history and culture, but the damage done to its heritage over more than 100 days of Israeli bombardment spreads across the city.

For the few Palestinians who remain, and the far greater number displaced and hoping to return, the culture and history has been reduced to memories.

“The city is a ghost town, people walk around with pale faces and their spirits are tired after having gone through this war. If you walk to the old city of Gaza, you will only remember the memories and feel sickened and saddened by the amount of destruction of cultural and religious sites,” said Bader Alzaharna, who lives in Gaza City despite the intensity of Israel’s ground operation in the area.

Male birth control is undergoing some major developments across the world - from gels to non-hormonal pills - which could even the playing field when it comes to the balance of birth control responsibility between the sexes.

While the number of contraceptive options for cisgender women and people with uteruses have grown ever the introduction of the hormonal birth control pill in the 1960s — which helped revolutionise the lives of many women across the world by giving them control over their fertility — the available birth control options for cisgender men and people with penises remain minimal.

"If we were to focus on tackling huge methane leaks in the waste sector, it could be a “gamechanger”, experts have said after a Guardian investigation found there have been more than 1,000 uncontrolled leaks of the potent greenhouse gas from landfill waste dumps since 2019.

Analysis of global satellite data shows the populous nations of south Asia are a hotspot for these super-emitter events, as well as Argentina and Spain, developed countries where proper waste management should prevent leaks.

Landfills emit methane when organic waste such as food scraps, wood, card, paper and garden waste decompose in the absence of oxygen.

Methane, also called natural gas, traps 86 times more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over 20 years, making it a critical target for climate action. Scientists have said emissions from unmanaged landfills could double by 2050 as urban populations grow, blowing the chance of avoiding climate catastrophe.

A total of 1,256 methane super-emitter events occurred between January 2019 and June 2023, according to the new data. Pakistan, India and Bangladesh lead the list of nations with the most large leaks, followed by Argentina, Uzbekistan and Spain.

"‘I’m so scared, please come,’ cried six-year-old Hind Rajab in a telephone call with Palestinian rescuers.

For three hours she begged the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) to save her. She was trapped in a vehicle surrounded by her dead relatives after they came under fire in Gaza City.

Twelve days later, Hind’s family said that she was found dead inside the car in the Tel al-Hawa area of Gaza City. 

The PRCS, which released an audio recording of the call with Hind, said it had located its bombed-out ambulance just metres away, adding that two paramedics, Yusuf Al-Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoun, had also been killed.

Gaza City has been devastated by fighting between Israel and Hamas since the war broke out four months ago and Hind’s family had reportedly been hoping to seek shelter elsewhere.

The PRCS accused Israel of deliberately targeting the ambulance. ‘The occupation deliberately targeted the Red Crescent crew despite prior coordination to allow the ambulance to arrive at the site to rescue Hind,’ it said in a statement.

Brussel’s quiet determination has led her to shatter world records and transformed her into an unlikely celebrity within the amateur swim community.

"Do you think blue cards will be good for football? 

Players could be shown blue cards and sent to a sin-bin for dissent and cynical fouls under plans to be unveiled by the body that decides the laws of the game.

Sitting alongside the current ­yellow and red cards, a blue card would result in a player being removed from the field of play for 10 minutes. 

At risk of muddying the palette, there will also be the possibility to mix colours. If a player returns from the sin-bin and receives another blue card, they would also be shown a red card and be permanently dismissed from the game. A combination of one blue and one yellow, meanwhile, would also make a red.

The recommendations are set to be made by the International Football Association Board (Ifab) on Friday ahead of trials across competitions.

"Rhinos have, for more than a century, been hunted and poached for their horns, which are sold in illegal wildlife markets, and the species is critically endangered, meaning there is a very high chance of it becoming extinct in the wild.

But, a UK wildlife park has now welcomed a rare black baby rhino for the first time in its history, which could have a significant impact on international conservation efforts to protect the species.

The male calf, who already weighs 73 kilos, arrived at Yorkshire Wildlife Park (YWP), in Doncaster, on 16 January – with the zoo allowing him to explore the outdoor reserve this week.

His mother, Najuma, who was pregnant for 15 months before giving birth, first began showing early signs of pregnancy over a year ago and rangers continually monitored her. The seven-year-old and the new arrival’s father, Makibo, eight, joined the wildlife park in 2018 as part of an international breeding programme.

"“Shame,” said the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, as he angrily confronted Rishi Sunak in parliament when the prime minister derided Labour’s policy on transgender rights after being told the mother of the murdered teenager Brianna Ghey was watching from the public gallery.

“Of all the weeks to say that, when Brianna's mother is in this chamber …” Starmer said.

Other opposition MPs shouted “shame” at Sunak, while critics also took to X to denounce the PM’s jibe, including Anneliese Dodds, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, who tweeted: “This isn’t the first time Rishi Sunak has used LGBT+ people as a punchline to a cruel joke. But making jokes about trans people in front of the mother of Brianna Ghey is a shameful new low.”

Sunak ignored Starmer’s comments in his next reply during PMQs and when asked later in the session by Labour’s Liz Twist to apologise to Brianna’s mother, he ignored the question, despite shouts of “apologise” from the opposition benches.

At the end of PMQs, Sunak praised Esther Ghey, saying she represented “the very best of humanity …” He did not apologise, however.

It is understood that while Sunak made the comments after being told Ghey was watching, she actually arrived in chamber slightly late and so missed the initial exchange.

Downing Street said afterwards the prime minister stood by what he said in the chamber, and said it was “legitimate” for him to highlight Starmer's U-turns.

Starmer has been accused of backsliding on transgender rights after U-turning on his promise to introduce self-identification for trans people if Labour were to win the general election last July.

After PMQs, Starmer met Esther Ghey, Brianna’s mother. She is campaigning for a ban on under-16s using social media on smartphones. In a BBC interview this weekend, Esther said her daughter might have been saved if the online searches being made by her eventual killers had been flagged to their parents.

Living funerals, which are also known as pre-funerals, offer a chance for people to say goodbye to their friends and families on their own terms and to celebrate their life while they are still alive.

It’s not an entirely new concept. Living funerals started gaining popularity in Japan in the 1990s, where they’re known as _seizenso_ (“funeral while living”), with the idea that it would take the pressure off family members or friends organising a funeral after someone had died. The practice has also taken off in South Korea. In 2019, 25,000 people took part in a mass living funeral to face their mortality and embrace living.

There are many reasons why someone might have one. They might be terminally ill, or they might simply be getting older and want to celebrate their life and relationships while they still can.

"A Guardian investigation has detailed the mass destruction of buildings and land in three neighbourhoods in Gaza.

Using satellite imagery and open-source evidence, the investigation found damage to more than 250 residential buildings, 17 schools and universities, 16 mosques, three hospitals, three cemeteries and 150 agricultural greenhouses.

Entire buildings have been levelled, fields flattened and places of worship wiped off the map in the course of Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, launched after the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.

The destruction in Gaza has not only forced 1.9 million people to leave their homes but also made it impossible for many to return.

The Israeli military says that its fight is against Hamas and not Gaza, that its bombardment is proportional to the threat posed by Hamas and that it is making every effort to warn citizens of imminent attacks.

An IDF spokesperson told the Guardian: “Hamas operates nearby, underneath, and within densely populated areas as a matter of routine operational practice. As part of the IDF’s operations, it [has] been carrying out strikes on military targets, as well as locating and destroying infrastructure when imperatively required to achieve the goals of the war.”

"“Quite a surprise”

A king penguin has been filmed on a South Australia coastline, raising questions about why the bird is thousands of kilometres away from its usual sub-Antarctic habitat.

Jeff Campbell, the chair of Friends of Shorebirds South East, was part of a group of eight people doing a bird survey along the Coorong beach when they spotted the penguin. “It came right up to us ... It put its head back and made a braying call, quite loud, then bowed to us,” he said.

The bird, usually found on subantarctic islands, believed to be undergoing annual moulting on land at Coorong beach.

They are close relatives of the larger emperor penguins, but prefer the subantarctic islands to the Antarctic ice shelf.

Dr Julie McInnes, from the University of Tasmania’s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies, Ecology and Biodiversity, says that the Australian mainland was the furthest these penguins could go - and that while global heating was causing changes in penguins’ distribution, that would probably cause them to seek cooler water.

It could also just be that the penguin got off track looking for land – usually they would moult on their colony’s island.

"A vehicle loaded with gas exploded and set off an inferno that burned homes and warehouses in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, according to authorities.

The truck explosion ignited a huge fireball, and a flying gas cylinder set off a fire that destroyed the Oriental Godown, a garments and textiles warehouse, said government spokesperson Isaac Mwaura.

Several other vehicles and businesses were damaged by the blaze that started at about 11.30pm local time (2030 GMT) on Thursday.

Alfred Juma, an aspiring politician, said he heard loud noise from a gas cylinder in a warehouse next to his house. “I started waking up neighbours asking them to leave,” Juma said.

He said he grabbed two children and they hid in a sewage ditch until the explosions ended. His family had not been present, but Juma says he lost everything he owned in the fire.

At least three people were killed and more than 270 injured, with the death toll expected to rise. Read our full report via the link in bio.",2024-02-02 14:06:12
"Farmers clashed with police in front of the European parliament, throwing eggs toward the building ahead of an EU leader’s summit in Brussels.

Hundreds of farmers blockaded roads and camped outside the building to protest against the rising costs in the agriculture sector and dropping prices for produce.

The wave of farmer protests in the past few days are the latest episode in a growing political backlash which has been brewing for months over the prices they receive for food. Many farmers blame cheap imports and the impact of environmental policies imposed by the bloc for their plight.

Protesters in Belgium have dumped manure outside parliament buildings in the south of the country and blocked one of the biggest ports in Europe, while French farmers have been blocking major highways out of Paris with tractors.

"Surveillance footage shows the moment members of an Israeli special forces team stormed Ibn Sina hospital in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, during an early morning raid.

About a dozen undercover troops, most of them armed, are seen dressed as women with Muslim headscarves or hospital staff in scrubs or white coats. The forces are seen patting down one man who kneeled against a wall, his arms raised.

Three men were killed in the raid, one of whom the Israeli military accused of planning an imminent attack. The Israeli military said the men were using the hospital as a hideout and planning an attack.

Hamas said one of the people killed was a member, while the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said the other two were part of their group.

The Palestinian health ministry condemned the raid, saying Israeli forces opened fire inside the wards of the hospital.

Hospital spokesperson Tawfiq al-Shobaki said there was no exchange of fire, indicating that it was a targeted killing, and said that the Israelis attacked doctors, nurses, and hospital security during the raid.

Violence in the West Bank has escalated since 7 October as Israel has cracked down on suspected militants, killing more than 380 Palestinians, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

The Israeli military says it has arrested nearly 3,000 Palestinians in the West Bank over the past four months.

"From laxative teas to weight-loss gummies, there’s a lot of diet products on the market, and new research shows that teenagers are taking them.

Nearly one in 10 adolescents have used a medically unapproved weight-loss product, according to a new global study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

It finds the prevalence of 12- to 18-year-olds using diuretics, laxatives and diet pills without a prescription from a doctor was 2% in the past week, 4% in the past month, 6% in the past year and 9% in their lifetime.

As well as being potentially harmful for young people’s health, unapproved diet products can also be dangerous for your mental health.

"A New York City jury awarded $83.3m to E Jean Carroll in her defamation trial against Donald Trump on Friday.

Carroll will receive $18.3m in compensatory damages and $65m in punitive retribution.

The Manhattan federal court decision comes less than one year after Carroll won $5m in her sexual abuse and defamation trial against the ex-president.

This sum stems from Carroll’s rape claim against the president in a June 2019 New York magazine article. The publication ran an excerpt of her then-forthcoming book, What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal.

In that excerpt, Carroll said that Trump raped her inside the dressing room of a luxe Manhattan department store around early 1996. 

The tenor of Trump’s denials – saying, for example, that she lied and was a political operative – became the subject of her 2019 defamation suit against him.

At the time, Carroll could not sue Trump over the alleged assault, as it would have taken place outside the civil statute of limitations. A novel New York state law in 2022, the Adult Survivors Act, opened a one-year window for adult accusers to file suit for incidents outside the civil statute of limitations.

Carroll filed another lawsuit, this one over the incident and defamatory statements after Trump’s presidency ended. This lawsuit proceeded to trial first and the judge in both cases, Lewis Kaplan, determined jurors’ findings – that Trump sexually abused Carroll and tarnished her reputation – would be accepted as fact in this trial.

As a result, Trump could not re-litigate her sexual abuse claim. The jurors were tasked only with weighing financial penalties for damaging Carroll’s reputation – and the sum required to keep Trump from making still more defamatory statements.

“I’m here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened,” Carroll said on the stand. “He lied, and it shattered my reputation. I expected him to deny it, but to say it was consensual, when it was not. But that’s what I expected him to say.”

"The UN's top court, the international court of justice (ICJ), has ordered Israel to 'take all measures within its power' to ensure its forces do not commit acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. It also ordered Israel to take measures to prevent and punish the direct incitement of genocide in the war.

However, the interim ruling on South Africa’s allegation that the war in Gaza amounts to genocide against Palestinians stopped short of ordering a halt to Israeli military action in Gaza. South Africa had asked the court to order an immediate ceasefire.

The presiding judge, Joan Donoghue, said the court was ""deeply concerned"" by the continuing loss of life and human suffering, and ruled that it would not grant Israel's request to throw out the case. The court also ordered immediate measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

South Africa described the ruling in The Hague as a “decisive victory” for the international rule of law and said it sincerely hoped Israel would not frustrate the application of the order.

Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu said: “We will continue to defend ourselves and our citizens while adhering to international law,” adding that the ICJ’s willingness to discuss genocide claims against Israel was “a disgrace that will not be erased for generations”.

The ICJ rulings are binding and cannot be appealed against, although the court has no power to enforce them. To read our full coverage tap the link in bio.",2024-01-26 16:56:34

"A Russian military transport plane has crashed in Russia’s border region of Belgorod, according to the country’s defence ministry, killing all 74 people on board.

The ministry said the aircraft was carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were to be swapped. The ministry added that onboard the Soviet-designed Ilyushin Il-76 were also six crew and three Russian servicemen.

Footage circulating on social media appeared to show the moment a large aircraft crashed and exploded in a vast fireball. Other images showed wreckage scattered over a snowy field.

The Guardian could not immediately verify details of who was onboard and the cause of the crash was not yet known. Ukraine has not yet commented on the incident.

This month, the two countries announced the largest exchange of prisoners since the start of the war, involving the return of more than 200 soldiers from each side in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates.

The Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, is a vital stop on Russian supply lines. It has come under extensive shelling and drone attacks for months including a missile strike on the region’s capital in December that killed 25 people.

"A boarding school in Massachusetts has wrapped up the first year of a simple yet novel experiment: banning cellphones on campus. Or, rather, smartphones.

Instead, the school, Buxton, gave everyone on campus – including staff – a Light Phone, that is, a “dumb” phone with limited functionality. They are about the size of a deck of cards, with black and white screens. As one student put it: “It’s like the demon baby of an iPad and a Kindle.”

Most everyone agrees, however, that the school is better off without smartphones. (And yes, that includes students.) There are fewer interruptions during class, more meaningful interactions around campus, and less time spent on screens.

Educators across the country report waging a near-constant battle against phones. A survey of a school district in Virginia found that about a third of teachers were telling students to put away their cellphones five to 10 times a class, and 14.7% did so more than 20 times a class.

When the no smartphone policy was announced, Buxton saw a progression through the stages of panic, grief and ultimately some level of acceptance.

“I practically had a breakdown,” said then senior Max Weeks. And while he’s still not a fan of what he says was a “unilateral” decision to switch to the Light Phone, he said, overall, the experience “hasn’t been as bad as I expected”.

"How should assaults in the metaverse be handled?

British police are investigating the virtual sexual assault of a girl, identified only as being under the age of 16, in what is said to be the first investigation of its kind in the UK.

The girl was reportedly wearing a virtual reality headset and playing an immersive game in the metaverse when her avatar was attacked by several others.

An unnamed senior officer said the victim did not suffer physical harm, but experienced “psychological trauma” that was “similar to that of someone who has been physically raped”, according to an exclusive report in the Daily Mail.

But in criminal law, rape and sexual assault require there to have been physical contact.

We spoke with Nina Jane Patel, a psychotherapist and VR expert whose research investigates the physiological and psychological intricacies of the metaverse.

@ninajanepatel who has experienced being sexually assaulted in the metaverse herself in 2021, speaks about the realities of crimes in the metaverse, the ethics of who is held accountable, and what the future could look like if we don’t take cases like this seriously.

"“I feel happy that we make the children forget about the attacks for a while. I feel happy when I see some smiles on their faces.”

This is Ahmed Alghariz, the co-founder of Camp Breakerz, a group of dancers who were teaching and performing in Gaza.

The group was preparing to launch a show that would begin on 7 October, but their plans were halted by the Hamas terror attack and Israel’s subsequent and ongoing assault on Gaza.

Camp Breakerz Crew (@campsbreakerz ) has been at the forefront of Gaza’s hip-hop scene since 2004 and all the members have lived through several wars in Gaza.

After getting trapped by the fighting late last year, the dance crew spent more than two months entertaining children who have been displaced from their homes by Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza Strip.

Ahmed and the other members of the Camp Breakerz have managed to leave Gaza since recording this interview in November. Despite trying over the last few months, Ahmed says: “We don’t have any contact with our kids.” One of his fellow members Mosa aka Pal is still running activities for children in Rafah, Egypt.

"“There is no ‘but’ when it concerns gender-based violence. The use of sexual violence in conflict to coerce, terrorise, sow fear, or for any other reason is no exception.”

Deborah Lipstadt, the US special envoy to combat antisemitism, and Michèle Taylor, the US permanent representative to the UN human rights council, say the failure to respond to the reports of sexual violence by Hamas are “not just a failure of justice” but also a “sign of deeper biases that must be addressed.

”This fight transcends borders and cultural divides. In recognising the horrific experiences of Israeli women, we also need to manifestly acknowledge that Palestinian women and girls are victims and survivors of gender-based violence. Rape and mutilation of women are never acceptable,” they said, writing in the Guardian.

“This is something on which we all must agree – regardless of our position on the broader conflict,” the pair added, as they described how they are both “deeply troubled – and remain so – by the slow response of international organisations, governments and civil society to these horrific occurrences” on 7 October.

"A crowd of more than 100 family members, friends and supporters greeted two female Iranian journalists outside Evin prison in Tehran moments after they were temporarily released.

Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammad were among the first journalists to break the news of the death of Mahsa Amini, the young Kurdish woman whose death in custody sparked nationwide protests in 2022. 

They were sentenced to over 10 years in jail after they were found guilty of spreading propaganda; committing a crime against national security; and collaborating with a foreign state.

After appealing their sentences – and 17 months later – they walked towards friends and family flashing victory signs. A brief moment of joy celebrating their release on bail.

But just one  day later, the state-controlled Mizan news agency said that the two women were charged for not wearing a hijab after photos of them embracing and celebrating their release were widely circulated on social media.

Activists and human rights organisations say the state is taking an increasingly harsh stance against those who refuse to comply with Iran’s mandatory hijab law, which requires all women to cover their heads and hair when in public. Punishments could include long prison sentences, lashings and heavy fines.

It was easily the biggest ever victory by a Republican in the Iowa caucuses and, according to the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief David Smith, “an eerie replay of 2016”.

“For the millions of Americans who abhor Donald Trump, there was a similar sensation on Monday night as he swaggered out on stage in Des Moines, having just scored a resounding victory,” he writes.

“The result came so quickly that not many people had yet gathered at Trump’s election watch party in Des Moines. There was no great cheer to celebrate the moment.

The Associated Press called the race for Trump rapidly, while caucusgoers in much of the state were still casting ballots, a sign of the wide lead the former president has in the race.

Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are vying for second place. Whoever takes second place, albeit a distant one to Trump’s commanding lead, will see more momentum in their campaign. It’s possible the field will winnow down more after the caucus results.

As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by Israel’s attacks across the strip continue to worsen, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has said that “aid alone will not be sufficient to reverse a looming famine. A flow of commercial goods must also be allowed in.”

The UNRWA chief, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement published on Sunday: “The crisis in Gaza is a man-made disaster compounded by dehumanising language and the use of food, water and fuel as instruments of war.”

Writing for the Guardian, the British foreign secretary and former prime minister, David Cameron, has urged Israel to allow more aid into Gaza, saying it will do nothing for hostages held in the territory or Israel’s war aims if the situation turns into an even greater catastrophe.

They chronicle the daily challenges facing pastoralist women as the climate crisis increases their burden of care, and food, fuel and water become scarcer.

Metito and Naneu were among 14 women in Kenya and Ghana who took part in a programme by @lensational, a social enterprise that supports underrepresented women to learn photography and document the changes happening in their lives on issues such as climate breakdown.

Female photographers trained by Lensational say visual storytelling is a powerful tool for their community, which faces marginalisation and illiteracy, and a way to disrupt the barriers that often keep their realities and perspectives from full view.

For a decade, apps have dominated dating. But now singles are growing tired of swiping and are looking for new ways to meet people – or reverting to old ones.

The most up-to-date figures show the world’s most popular dating app, Tinder, saw its users drop by 5% in 2021, while shares in both Bumble and Match Group, which owns Tinder, have declined steadily over the last couple of years.

“It does not matter how handsome or beautiful or charming you are, there is this underlying tension that you are 10 swipes away from a person that outranks you on the conventional beauty and charisma scale,” says Dylan Freeman-Grist, a 29-year-old living in Toronto, Canada. “It’s enough to make you feel all the insecurities that you haven’t needed to swallow since you were a teenager and a whole ream of new adult ones.”

Many say the apps feel like work and there is a genuine sense of burnout as people struggle to commit to what is essentially hours of admin a week alongside their day jobs and other responsibilities. And even those who have their pick of matches have found themselves having an unenjoyable experience.

“I’ve given myself the challenge of flirting with one person every day, which has been a lot of fun,” says Katy, a 37-year-old who lives in London. “It’s made me realize that so many people are wrapped up in their phones, and aren’t aware of people around them, which is quite sad. I’ve had some fun interactions, and while it hasn’t brought me any dates – yet – that’s not the goal. I’m in absolutely no hurry to bring dating apps back into my life.”

"“The devastation we submit … is intended to and has laid waste to Gaza beyond any acceptable legal, let alone humane justification,” said advocate of the high court of South Africa, Adila Hassim, as they outlined South Africa’s case against Israel in the International Courts of Justice at The Hague.

South Africa has brought a case to the ICJ accusing Israel of committing genocide in its military response to the 7 October Hamas attack in which 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians, were killed. The case refers to ways they believe Israel has violated the UN’s Genocide Convention, including the mass killing of civilians and what it alleges is an assault on the health system and the imposition of “conditions on Gaza that cannot sustain life”.

“All of these acts individually and collectively form a calculated pattern of conduct by Israel indicating a genocidal intent,” Hassim told the court.

Israel has described South Africa’s case as “baseless” and a “blood libel”, and will have three hours at the court tomorrow to oppose it.

"“It tells our country, our society, the world that we are running out of tolerance for what is happening to young people,” said the actor and musician Idris Elba as he called for more urgent action on youth knife violence.

“We have to offer solutions,” Elba told the Guardian, as he urged for the immediate banning of machetes and “zombie” knives, and more funding for youth services.

The star of Luther and The Wire launched his Don’t Stop Your Future campaign this week, which aims to help “put an end to knife crime and amplify the voices of marginalised communities”.

Knife crime in England and Wales is now 75% higher than in 2012-13, according to the Youth Endowment Fund’s analysis of police data.

The sale of zombie knives was largely banned in 2016, with the threat of prison time attached. But, by last April, ministers were still talking about the need to close a legal loophole before the weapons could in effect be considered banned.

Progress on passing new legislation has been slow and several high-profile incidents have occurred since it was promised; including the killing of the schoolgirl Elianne Andam in south London in September.

“With someone like myself that has this platform, it’s not that I am more qualified to speak on this,” said @idriselba. “It … takes a group of us.”

He added: “What’s really important is that we are listened to as a society, whether Idris says it or a youth campaigner says it”.

"“My husband never spoke to me of what happened. He was diagnosed with cancer a few years later and I’m tortured by the thought that the stress might have contributed to his illness.”

Vivienne Hammond, 88, told the Guardian she was traumatised by discovering what her late husband, Dennis, must have suffered in secret during the last 20 years of his life when she watched ITV’s dramatisation of the Horizon scandal.

More than 2,500 post office operators were wrongly accused of theft because of a glitch in a new accounting software system. The series, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, has led to new calls for victims to be exonerated.

“Focus has quite rightly been on those who were wrongly convicted or lost their livelihoods, but the hundreds of others who were made to pay back money they never took have also had to live with the pain and humiliation, and haven’t had their voices heard,” Hammond said.

"“Don’t shoot!” a person yelled before the TV signal was cut when a masked armed gang interrupted the El Noticiero news programme in Ecuador and forced employees to the floor.

Police made 13 arrests after recapturing TC Televisión network’s headquarters in Guayaquil on Tuesday. Two employees were injured in the attack.

The scenes on live TV came as criminal groups launched a series of attacks across Ecuador amid fresh outbreaks of violence in the country’s prisons.

President Noboa, who was elected in October on the promise to crack down on violent crime, declared a state of emergency on Monday, after the country’s most dangerous gang leader - Adolfo Macías, alias Fito - escaped from prison during a transfer to a maximum security facility.

Ecuador has repeatedly been the scene of brutal violence between warring drug gangs that has killed more than 420 inmates since 2021.

"“What has Hamza done to them [Israel], and what has my family done to them?” said Al Jazeera’s bureau chief in Gaza, Wael al-Dahdouh, as he mourned the death of his son.

Dahdouh’s wife, two other children and a grandson were killed by a previous Israeli strike in October.

Hamza, also a journalist, was killed along with Mustafa Thuria, while on assignment for Al Jazeera. A third freelancer, Hazem Rajab, was wounded, the Qatar-based media network said in a statement. The health ministry in Gaza confirmed the deaths and blamed an Israeli strike.

Al Jazeera said it “strongly condemns the Israeli occupation forces’ targeting of the Palestinian journalists’ car” and accused Israel of “targeting” journalists and “violating the principles of freedom of the press”.

The Israel Defense Forces told AFP it had “struck a terrorist who operated an aircraft that posed a threat to IDF troops”, adding that it was “aware of the reports that during the strike, two other suspects who were in the same vehicle as the terrorist were also hit”.

In a statement on 16 December, in response to the death of another Al Jazeera journalist in Gaza, the Israeli army said: “The IDF has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists.”

Before the latest deaths, the conflict had claimed the lives of 79 journalists, said Christophe Deloire of Reporters Without Borders. “It is definitely a never-ending slaughter,” Deloire wrote on social media.

"“I feel death would be easier than leaving al-Ratheem,” says 77-year-old Abu Safi, who was forced to flee his home of decades in the West Bank due to the rising intensity of Israeli settler violence in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October.

“We left all our clothes and other belongings. We didn’t think we’d be gone this long,” Safi told our Jerusalem correspondent Bethan McKernan in his brother’s house in the city of Yatta.

McKernan travelled to Khirbet al-Ratheem to witness the aftermath, and to the village of Masafer Yatta, where a Palestinian community is facing what some are calling “a new Nakba”.

They say their decades-long fight to remain in their homes has become even more fraught in the face of escalating intimidation by IDF soldiers on the one hand and radical Israeli settlers on the other.

"When more than 900 pages of legal documents relating to the case of convicted sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein were made public on Wednesday night, it caused an online frenzy that crashed the court website hosting the files in minutes.

The papers were unsealed late in the day, identifying numerous Epstein associates and public figures as mentioned in proceedings of the case Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre filed against Ghislaine Maxwell in 2015.

Maxwell, the US-based British socialite and media heir, was convicted in New York in December 2021 of sex trafficking and similar charges for procuring teen girls for Epstein – who died in jail awaiting federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019.

This next batch of records had remained sealed because of concerns about the privacy rights of Epstein’s victims and other people whose names had come up during the legal battle but were not complicit in his crimes.

"By the time you are reading this, the bosses of Britain’s biggest companies have made more money than the average UK worker will in the entire year, according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else in the country.

The High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, said that by 1pm on the third working day of the year, a FTSE 100 CEOs will have been paid more on an hourly basis than a UK worker’s annual salary of £34,963, based on median average remuneration figures for both groups.

Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC, the umbrella body for UK trade unions, said: “While working people have been forced to suffer the longest wage squeeze in modern history, City bosses have been allowed to pocket bumper rises and bankers have been given unlimited bonuses.”

Last year the government scrapped an EU rule capping the bonuses of bankers at 100% of salary, a measure that had been introduced in 2014 with the aim of avoiding another banking crisis.

The average pay of CEOs has increased by 9.5% since March 2023, while workers’ median pay has increased by 6%. The average pay of FTSE 100 CEOs dropped slightly during the pandemic, but has since increased by about a quarter.

The High Pay Centre also calculated how long it would take for other top earners to surpass the median UK worker’s full-time earnings:

Today, junior doctors in England went out on strike again, for six days.

It was December 2018, and the protests that finally overthrew President Omar al-Bashir’s regime had taken hold across the country, amid fuel shortages, a currency crisis and the tripling of bread prices.

Hundreds of young men and women were killed during the popular uprising, which called for a democratic civilian regime. The protests continued until April this year, when war broke out in Sudan.

Abdel Rahman’s father, Alsadiq, and other families have formed the Martyrs’ Families Organisation, to ensure the cause their children died for – freedom, peace and justice for Sudan – is realised.

Alsadiq wants his letter to his dead son to be published.

He writes: “I apologise to anyone who may be offended by the views expressed in this letter, but it was prompted by moments of longing for those we have lost and our inability to get on with our lives. We have been forced to live with an increasing amount of death. Who among us has not lost a loved one? No one.”

In the video, our science presenter explains how some of them could pose health risks.

Here are comments from two of the brands we talk about:

Essity, the owner of Bodyform and Modibodi, said silver copper zeolite was used to “prevent odour when wearing the pants for up to 12 hours”. It added that all of its “washable underwear is certified according to Oeko-Tex Standard 100, which means that every single component has been tested for harmful substances” and “that the underwear has been designated as harmless for human health”.

An M&S spokesperson said: “We do not use either nano silver or silver zeolite and, like many brands, use a small amount of silver chloride in the middle part of the gusset – away from the skin – which is perfectly safe, approved by the UK and EU, and designed to combat odour.”

"Did you know that Black women are almost twice as likely as white women to suffer from infertility?

It’s an issue compounded by medical bias and racist stereotypes, and one we’re exploring in our new series, The great fertility divide.

“I spent years suffering in silence, crying alone in the bathroom or sitting in my car,” said Monique Farook, a 40-year-old real estate investor in Frederick, Maryland. “This kind of thing didn’t happen in my family. My sister had multiple, healthy births. I didn’t want to be the anomaly.”

As part of our series, the Guardian spoke to Black women about the ups and downs of their medically assisted paths to motherhood.

Their stories shine a light on the fraught and often heartrending journeys many women face in America, as well as the deep inadequacies of fertility treatments in the country’s medical system.

"‘Transphobic bullying is rife,’ says Newton Carey, a 15-year-old student, who is also trans.

This is how he responded after the UK government finally published its long-delayed guidance for England’s schools on youth transition, which was proposed by Rishi Sunak earlier this year.

The document promises a clear set of principles for teachers and staff as they wrestle with the needs of children who are questioning their gender identity.

But while the guidance has been broadly welcomed by those who believe that it is currently too easy for young people to “socially transition” at school, there are others who disagree vehemently.

They see the government’s approach as informed by an underlying hostility to trans people, and scepticism about whether they even exist. And although the guidance does not include an outright ban on allowing social transition (said to have been under consideration until it was found to be unlawful), it clearly creates new barriers for teenagers who want to talk to teachers about their gender without fear of being outed at home.

"The Colorado supreme court has declared Donald Trump ineligible to hold office again under the US constitution’s insurrection clause.

In a historic decision, the justices ordered that he be removed from the state’s presidential primary ballot, after determining that he engaged in insurrection on 6 January 2021. 

The ruling sets up a likely showdown in the nation’s highest court to settle whether the January 6 attack on the Capitol amounted to an insurrection, and whether Trump’s involvement disqualifies him from running for office.

Trump has vowed to appeal to the US supreme court, his campaign said. “We have full confidence that the US supreme court will quickly rule in our favor and finally put an end to these un-American lawsuits,” said Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesperson.

The 4-3 decision by the Colorado supreme court marks the first time a presidential candidate has been deemed unqualified for office under a rarely used provision that bars insurrectionists from holding office.

"A volcano on the Reykjanes peninsula in south-west Iceland has erupted after weeks of intense earthquake activity, spewing glowing orange jets of lava surrounded by billowing clouds of red smoke.

The eruption began at about 10.17pm local time on Monday after a series of small earthquakes at about 9pm, the met office said.

After the eruption, the Icelandic prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir, said: “Now we see the earth opening up”.

She said her thoughts were with the people of the fishing town Grindavík, who were evacuated from their homes last month soon after the “seismic swarm” first started, saying: “We hope for the best.”

But, she warned: “It can be clear that this is a considerable eruption.”

Fortunately, last night when the volcano erupted, the nearly 4,000 inhabitants of the fishing town of Grindavik had already been evacuated.

Iceland’s foreign minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, said on X there were “no disruptions to flights to and from Iceland and international flight corridors remain open”.

"The destruction of more than a third of Gaza’s homes as Israel bombards the territory in pursuit of Hamas is leading international legal experts to raise the concept of “domicide”, writes our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, in his latest Guardian analysis piece.

In the current Gaza war, launched after Hamas launched its 7 October terror attack on southern Israel, independent experts estimate that as much as 40% of the housing in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed. The United Nations says 1.8 million people are internally displaced inside the strip, many living in overcrowded UN shelters in the south.

Although Gaza has been damaged in previous conflicts and rebuilt, largely with money from the Gulf states, the current scale of the devastation is of a different order, says Patrick.

Israel says all damage to buildings and loss of civilian life is regrettable but made necessary by Hamas deliberately hiding in schools and hospitals and by its refusal to surrender.

To hear why legal experts are calling for ‘domicide’ to be classed as a distinct crime against humanity, and whether the UN vote on a ceasefire earlier this week can change the situation on the ground, listen to our Today in Focus podcast via the link in bio.

This is the reason one Guardian reader told us when explaining why they’re donating to our charity appeal this year.

In 2023’s annual appeal, the Guardian and Observer are partnering with three UK-based charities: Refugee Councils of Britain, Refugees at Home, and the No Accommodation Network (Naccom). 

“It is no accident asylum seekers and refugees were among the 1.8m UK households experiencing destitution last year,” writes our editor-in-chief Katharine Viner in her most recent Guardian essay.

“Official support for asylum seekers (an allowance of less than £7 per person per day) is meagre, and they are not allowed to work.

“In a harsh political and financial climate, our appeal seeks to highlight the values of kindness, tolerance and respect alongside social justice.”

"“We will not go silently to our watery graves”: those were the stern words from John Silk, the head of the Marshall Islands delegation, in response to a draft climate agreement at Cop28.

The unequivocal condemnation of the draft by dozens of countries at the annual UN climate summit reflects the gravity of the situation for those who are facing the sharpest effects of the climate crisis.

The negotiations started off in Dubai on a hopeful note, even though it was being hosted in a country with deep connections to the oil industry. But after two weeks of debate, the mood had soured.

A draft deal put forward by the summit presidency was criticised by delegates as being “grossly insufficient”, “incoherent”, “unacceptable” and “unjust” because it did not include any mention of either “phasing out” or “phasing down” the use of fossil fuels.

After much anticipation, the second draft was published in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The crucial language has been toughened up, and includes a reference to “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems” – but countries now have to decide whether this change is enough for them, a process that will take a while.

So far, the reviews are mixed.

"Stephen Flynn, the SNP leader at Westminster, said it was ‘shameful’ that the UK abstained in the recent UN emergency vote calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

A total of 153 of the 193 member states voted for the ceasefire yesterday. Only 10 voted against it, including the US and Israel. The UK was among the 23 countries that abstained.

Tuesday’s adopted resolution expressed ‘grave concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and the suffering of the Palestinian civilian population’. It called for protection for Israeli and Palestinian civilians under international law and demanded the immediate release of all hostages.

Sunak said he was deeply concerned about the impact of fighting on civilians in Gaza and was working to get more aid into the territory.

More than 18,000 Palestinians have been killed since the conflict began, according to Gaza authorities, and it is estimated more than 80% of the population of 2.3 million have been pushed from their homes. Israeli authorities say at least 1,200 people were killed and 240 others taken hostage in Hamas’s terror attacks on Israel on 7 October.",2023-12-13 16:41:17

"The Guardian can reveal that refugees and migrants are being buried in unmarked graves across the EU at a scale that is unprecedented outside of war.

More than 1,000 men, women and children who died at the borders of Europe in the past decade were buried before they were identified, our reporting team has found. 

They lie in stark, often blank graves along the borders – rough white stones overgrown with weeds in Sidiro cemetery in Greece; crude wooden crosses on Lampedusa in Italy; in northern France faceless slabs marked simply “Monsieur X”; in Poland and Croatia plaques read “NN” for name unknown. 

On the Spanish island of Gran Canaria one grave states: “Migrant boat number 4. 25/09/2022.”

The European parliament passed a resolution in 2021 acknowledging the right of those who die on migration routes to be identified and recognised the need for a coordinated database to collect details of the bodies.

But across European countries the issue remains a legislative void, with no centralised data, nor any uniform process for dealing with the bodies piling up in morgues, funeral parlours and shipping containers.

Working with forensic scientists from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other researchers, NGOs and pathologists, the Guardian and a consortium of reporters pieced together for the first time the numbers of migrants and refugees who died in the past decade along the EU’s borders whose identities remain unknown. 

At least 2,162 bodies have still not been identified. They are the tip of the iceberg.

"The Israeli military campaign in southern Gaza has been just as devastating as in the north, said UN emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths, creating “apocalyptic” conditions and ending any possibility of meaningful humanitarian operations.

“What we’re saying today is: that’s enough now. It has to stop,” Griffiths said in an interview with the Guardian on Tuesday.

Since the temporary ceasefire collapsed nearly a week ago, Israeli forces and Hamas have been fighting house-to-house battles along the length of the Gaza Strip, with devastating consequences for the civilian population. Gaza's hospitals have reported many civilians dead and injured, with medical supplies dwindling.

The UN chief, António Guterres, on Wednesday invoked the rarely used Article 99 of the UN Charter “for the first time in my tenure as secretary general’, which says he may inform the council of matters he believes threaten international peace. He is expected to address the council to press for a ceasefire.

But Israel’s UN ambassador, Gilad Erdan, has reacted to the move, saying the secretary general invoked Article 99 to pressure Israel, accusing the UN chief of “a new moral low” and “bias against Israel”.

"Warning: this caption contains graphic descriptions of sexual violence.

Harrowing accounts of sexual violence carried out by Hamas during the 7 October terror attacks in southern Israel have been heard by the United Nations.

Israeli officials, frontline workers, senior US politicians and activists spoke at the event on Monday. Speakers attacked women’s rights activists and UN officials for not doing more to investigate or condemn these crimes, and called for a “full and fair investigation”.

The meeting, attended by about 800 people including diplomats from dozens of countries, watched videos from police interviews with first responders who described genital mutilation and shooting at breasts. A survivor of the attack on the Supernova rave described witnessing a gang rape.

Two first responders from Israel addressed the UN in person. Simcha Greinman, who collected victims’ remains from the sites of attacks, described finding a woman’s body, naked from the waist down, leaning over a bed. The corpse had been booby trapped with a live grenade, hidden in the woman’s hand, he added.

Hamas denies that its fighters carried out sexual violence; former Meta executive Sheryl Sandberg, who in part organised the meeting, asked if the world should believe them, or “the women whose bodies tell us how they spent the last minutes of their lives”.

Benjamin Zephaniah, the British poet and writer who was known for his work on race, racism and political injustice, has died aged 65 after being diagnosed with a brain tumour eight weeks ago, a post on his Instagram page stated.

“Benjamin was a true pioneer and innovator, he gave the world so much. Through an amazing career including a huge body of poems, literature, music, television and radio, Benjamin leaves us with a joyful and fantastic legacy”.

Zephaniah’s work was heavily influenced by Jamaican music and poetry, and he was often classified as a dub poet. He was included in The Times list of Britain's top 50 post-war writers in 2008.

"“You would not invite arms dealers to a peace conference,” said David Tong from the organisation Oil Change International, after revelations that a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists have been given access to this year’s Cop28 summit.

At least 2,456 fossil fuel lobbyists have been granted access to the climate conference - four times as many as at Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, which itself was a record year.

Fossil fuel lobbyists at Cop28 outnumber:
⚫ official Indigenous representatives (316) by seven to one.
⚫ every country's delegation apart from Brazil (3,081) and Cop28 hosts the UAE (4,409).
⚫ the number of delegates from the 10 most climate vulnerable countries combined, including Somalia, Solomon Islands and Sudan.

These figures, calculated by the Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition, raise further questions about the fossil fuel industry’s influence over this year’s UN summit, which is being run by the president of the United Arab Emirates’ national oil company.

Momentum to secure commitment from countries around the world to phase out fossil fuels - which scientists say is needed to stop climate catastrophe - has been growing at Cop28, especially among the most vulnerable countries.

“Countries and communities are here negotiating for their lives, while the fossil companies and their enablers are here for their wallets,” added Tong.

Drue Slatter, a Fijian member of the Pacific Climate Warriors, said: “They are here in such big numbers because they are scared. The people have spoken, the science has spoken. We need to get them out of these negotiations.”

Johnson began two days of giving evidence to the Covid inquiry today, where he denied deleting the messages. His appearance has been the most eagerly awaited moment so far in an inquiry overseen by a former judge.

As reported in the Guardian in October, no WhatsApp messages from 31 January 2020 to 7 June that year, covering the arrival of the virus and the period leading up to and after the first lockdown, could be retrieved. The Times has now reported that technical teams have still been unable to access the messages.

A spokesperson for the former PM said: “Boris Johnson has fully cooperated with the inquiry’s disclosure process and has submitted hundreds of pages of material. He has not deleted any messages. The Times report refers to a technical issue in recovery of material that is for the technical team to address.”

While Johnson’s WhatsApp messages would most likely be a significant source of information for the current module of the inquiry, which is looking at government decision making, the hope is that the bulk of his messages will be retained by those to whom he sent them, who will have included them in their own evidence.

Johnson, who was PM between 2019-2022, stopped using the iPhone in question in May 2021 on security advice, after it emerged that his phone number had been accessible online for at least 15 years.

"What pictures can you see in this murmuration?

Described as “breathtaking”, 41-year-old Roberto Biddau captured this starling murmuration taking place in Italy.

Biddau (@zefiro82 ), a doctor from the Sardinian city of Sassari, who filmed this video in November, says he has enjoyed the murmuration of starlings that visits his home every around the same time every year.

“The birds meet in the city at sunset and go to rest in the trees,” he says. “They are migrating from north to south, in autumn they arrive in Sassari and many people watch them.”

Why starlings murmurate is not fully understood. One theory is that massive numbers help the birds keep warm before going to roost; another is that it maximises each individual’s chance of survival when under assault by aerial predators.

How the birds move together in such close proximity, as though one organism, is another mystery. One study from 2013 found that each starling was responding instantly to the six or seven birds closest to it to maintain group cohesion.

"The most hazardous nuclear site in Europe, Sellafield, has a worsening leak from a huge silo of radioactive waste that could pose a risk to the public, the Guardian can reveal.

Concerns over safety at the crumbling building, as well as cracks in a reservoir of toxic sludge known as B30, have caused diplomatic tensions with countries including the US, Norway and Ireland, which fear Sellafield has failed to get a grip of the problems.

The leak of radioactive liquid from one of the “highest nuclear hazards in the UK” – a decaying building at the vast Cumbrian site known as the Magnox swarf storage Silo (MSSS) – is likely to continue to 2050. That could have “potentially significant consequences” if it gathers pace, risking contaminating groundwater, according to an official document.

Cracks have also developed in the concrete and asphalt skin covering the huge pond containing decades of nuclear sludge, part of a catalogue of safety problems at the site.

These concerns have emerged in Nuclear Leaks, a year-long Guardian investigation into problems spanning cyber hacking, radioactive contamination and toxic workplace culture at the vast nuclear dump.

Sellafield is understood to argue that the leak poses “no additional risk” to staff and the public.

A spokesperson for the site said: “We are proud of our safety record at Sellafield and we are always striving to improve.

“The nature of our site means that until we complete our mission, our highest hazard facilities will always pose a risk.

“We continuously measure and report on nuclear, radiological, and conventional safety.

“Any incidents, including those highlighted by the Guardian, are reported to our regulator, published on our website, and shared for scrutiny in public meetings.”",2023-12-05 18:03:28
"Farid and Qoosay Salout were born with severe craniofacial issues and a disorder that left their eyes abnormally far apart.

For babies born with their condition, surgical intervention would ideally start in the first year of life. But there wasn’t a single surgeon in Gaza who could perform the risky and highly specialized procedures the boys needed.

The Gaza Strip is largely cut off from the world. After Hamas’s electoral victory in 2006, Israel imposed a strict land, sea and air blockade that has been going on for 17 years now, contributing to a series of wars between the two, of which this one is the fifth and most devastating.

Primary care is almost non-existent in Gaza – by extension the same is true of preventive care and early intervention when someone does have a medical issue.

It was into this reality that the Salout boys were born. Without outside intervention, they didn’t stand a chance.

That’s where an organization called the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund stepped in. After receiving a special permit to enter Israel for a visa interview at the US embassy, the Salout brothers and their adult companion – their grandmother – were approved to travel.

For their first flight to the US, Farid and Qoosay’s grandmother dressed them up in three-piece suits.

But on 8 November, Farid, Qoosay, their little brother, their father and six other relatives were killed when an Israeli airstrike hit their four-story building in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.

Whether you have it or not (shout out @tomholland2013), after more than 32,000 votes “rizz” has been crowned the word of 2023 by dictionary publisher Oxford University Press (OUP).

“Rizz”, taken from the word “charisma”, follows 2022’s “goblin mode”, which has almost the opposite meaning of its successor and was defined as “the behaviour of someone who wants to feel comfortable and do and eat whatever they want, not caring about trying to be clean, healthy, or attractive, or about pleasing or impressing other people”.

Rizz won the poll by OUP, publisher of the Oxford English Dictionary, after a public vote on a shortlist of eight words put together by a team of language experts. The experts made the final selection from the four finalists, which included words such as “swiftie” and “prompt”.

Use of the word rizz has increased dramatically in 2023, with a peak in June 2023, when the actor Tom Holland was asked in a Buzzfeed interview about the secret to his rizz, to which he answered: “I have no rizz whatsoever, I have limited rizz.”

“It speaks to how younger generations create spaces – online or in person – where they own and define the language they use,” @oxunipress said in a statement. “From activism to dating and wider culture, as gen Z comes to have more impact on society, differences in perspectives and lifestyle play out in language, too.”

"“No, we can’t go back to this again!!! No, please, no!”

This is what teacher and Gaza resident Eman Basher posted on X as Israel's military resumed combat operations in the territory.

Heavy fighting was reported in the Gaza Strip on Friday, as the fragile seven-day humanitarian pause between Israel and Hamas came to an end.

In the hour before the truce was set to end, Israel said it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza, accusing Hamas of violating the ceasefire. Hamas has not claimed responsibility for the rocket launches.

Shortly after the Israeli military’s announcement, Palestinian media reported that Israeli strikes had occurred in northern Gaza.

“The resumption of hostilities in Gaza is catastrophic. We urge all parties and states with influence over them to redouble efforts immediately to ensure a ceasefire on humanitarian and human rights grounds,” said the UN high commissioner for human rights, Ravina Shamdasani.

“Recent comments by Israeli political and military leaders indicating that they are planning to expand and intensify the military offensive are very troubling.”

The death toll since the resumption of fighting has increased again – now standing at 109, Reuters quotes the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry as saying.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warned Gaza’s health system was on its knees even before the ceasefire ended, with hospitals resembling a “horror movie”.

"How’re we doing on stopping the planet from slipping into climate disaster?

As world leaders arrive in Dubai at the world’s largest climate conference for tense talks on how to tackle the climate crisis, experts warn that “time is running out” to tackle the worst of its effects.

“We are living through climate collapse in real time,” the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has told delegates at Cop28, which comes after a year where words such as “unprecedented”, “extreme”, “record-breaking” and even “hellish” have become routine headlines when reporting on the climate crisis.

And while global heating is disproportionately impacting poorer countries — who’ve done the least to contribute to it — no country can think itself immune from catastrophe, said Simon Stiell, the UN’s top climate official.

“We’re now at the point where we’re all on the frontline,” said Stiell, speaking exclusively to the Guardian before the summit. “Yet most governments are still strolling when they need to be sprinting.”

But, while the headlines can seem bleak, we should not feel hopeless, scientists say. Researchers have urged a transition to a global economy that prioritises human wellbeing and cuts the overconsumption and excessive emissions of the rich.

“This year has seen communities around the world pounded by fires, floods, and searing temperatures – and the impact is devastating,” Guterres said. “Record global heating should send shivers down the spines of world leaders. And it should trigger them to act.”

"The Colorado officer who stopped Elijah McClain in 2019 and placed him in a neck hold was reinstated to the Aurora police department and will receive $200,000 in back pay, city officials have said.

Nathan Woodyard’s “reintegration” into the police force comes weeks after a jury found him not guilty of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.

Woodyard had been suspended without pay for two years since he was indicted for his role in the death of the 23-year-old. An Aurora spokesperson said city law mandated that the department offer him his job back after his acquittal in the criminal trial, and that he would receive $212,546 to cover the salary from his leave.

The killing of McClain, who became unconscious as he was held down by multiple officers and then was injected with a dangerously high dose of ketamine, sparked national outrage and years of protests. McClain was a massage therapist and animal lover who had taught himself to play violin.

On 24 August 2019, McClain was walking home from buying iced tea at a convenience store and listening to music on headphones when a driver passing by called police, reporting that McClain “looks sketchy” and “might be a good person or a bad person”. McClain was wearing a ski mask, which he used to keep warm due to being anemic.

Although the 911 caller made clear that he did not see any weapons and that he was not in danger, nor was anyone else, police quickly responded with extreme force.

Woodyard was the first to confront McClain, body-camera footage showed, immediately grabbing him and shouting: “I have a right to stop you because you’re being suspicious.”

Two other police officers, Randy Roedema and Jason Rosenblatt, soon arrived and with Woodyard surrounded him. McClain responded: “I’m an introvert. Please respect the boundaries that I’m speaking … I’m going home.”

The three forced McClain to the ground and placed him in a neck hold, while putting their combined body weight on top of him. McClain said “I can’t breathe” at least seven times.

"After 400 hours trapped inside a collapsed Himalayan tunnel in India’s northern Uttarakhand state, all 41 construction workers were freed during a tense rescue operation.

The men were working on the Silkyara-Barkot tunnel when a landslide on 12 November caused a part of it to cave in, trapping them 200m away from the tunnel's mouth.

The men survived on oxygen and food packets containing dried chickpeas and fruits, almonds and puffed rice that were funnelled to them through small pipes inserted into the cavity where they were trapped.

The complex and delicate rescue operation faced risks and setbacks.

After several attempts failed, rescuers were forced to use vertical drilling to reach the trapped miners, which officials warned could pose a ‘huge threat’ to the mountains and destabilise the surrounding terrain due to its heavy vibrations.

The drilling machine bored its way through the wall of rubble, and then a rescue pipe wide enough for the men to be evacuated offered a way out.",2023-11-29 15:06:37

This is why the Rev Alan Stuart said he took part in a two-day blockade of the world’s largest coal port in south-eastern Australia.

On the morning of 25 November, groups of protesters took turns paddling out into the port in the city of Newcastle, New South Wales' shipping lane to maintain a 30-hour blockage, with hundreds paddling on kayaks, surfboards and pontoons.

Rising Tide, the protest organisers, called the blockade the ""biggest act of civil disobedience for climate in Australia's history"".

"Do you have extreme reactions, or “sound rage”, when you hear small, repetitive sounds that other people don’t seem to notice?

You might have a condition called misophonia, says Dr Jane Gregory – a clinical psychologist at the University of Oxford, author of Sounds Like Misophonia and a lifetime sufferer herself.

Misophonia, a condition that was largely unknown until the 2010s, is a phenomenon whereby particular sounds can prove unbearable, triggering physical and emotional reactions – from anxiety and panic to shame and anger.

While only about 14% of the UK population have heard of the condition, according to a scientific paper from King’s College London, nearly one in five people in the UK suffer from it.

#Misophonia has 264.8m views on TikTok, while celebrities such as the comedian Seann Walsh have recently come forward about suffering from the condition.

And, while there may not be a total cure for misophonia, Gregory says, there are things that can really help – including creating new associations with the sounds that trigger you.

"The king is profiting from the deaths of thousands of people in the north-west of England, whose assets are secretly being used to upgrade the Duchy of Lancaster, a controversial land and property estate that generates huge profits for King Charles III.

Tens of millions of pounds in recent years have been collected by the hereditary estate under an antiquated custom that dates back to feudal times, known as bona vacantia or “vacant goods”.

In England and Wales, the assets of people who die without making a will and have no identifiable relatives are transferred to the Treasury, which then spends them on public services.

The only exception to this is for people who die in parts of England with historical links to two royal estates: the Duchy of Lancaster, which is the estate of King Charles, and the Duchy of Cornwall, which was inherited by Prince William.

These two vast property empires are run by professional executives and exist to generate supposedly “private” income for the monarch and heir to the throne.

Over the last 10 years, the Duchy of Lancaster has collected more than £60m of such funds. It has long claimed that, after deducting costs, bona vacantia revenues are donated to charities.

However, only a small percentage of these revenues is being given to charity. Internal duchy documents seen by the Guardian reveal how funds are secretly being used to finance the renovation of properties that are owned by the king and rented out for profit.

"Private jets belonging to 200 celebrities, CEOs, oligarchs and billionaires have spent a combined total of 11 years in the air since the start of 2022.

The carbon footprint of all those flights – a jaw-dropping 44,739 journeys – would be the equivalent of the total emissions of almost 40,000 people.

The Guardian used public data to track flights by private aircraft owned by celebrities and businesspeople including Elon Musk, the Rolling Stones, the Murdoch family and Kylie Jenner over 21 months.

The figures track the almost 300 jets belonging to those on the list and find that they emitted an estimated 415,518 tonnes of CO2.

The Guardian’s findings follow a sharp rise in private jet use since the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year, private jet activity in Europe was at its highest level since a 2007 peak and forecasts indicate that sales of private jets are likely to reach their highest ever level this year.

Not every flight analysed will have had the owner onboard. About 40% of private flights carry no passengers, as planes are moved around to pick people up. Many jets may have also been used by friends, family or business associates or lent to other individuals.

"“The super-rich are plundering and polluting the planet to the point of destruction and it is those who can least afford it who are paying the highest price,” says Chiara Liguori, Oxfam’s senior climate justice policy adviser.

A new report revealed by the Guardian shows we are not equally to blame for rising temperatures, and that both the super-rich and the middle class are disproportionately destroying the planet.

The world’s richest 10% – which encompasses most of the middle classes in developed countries – causes up to 40 times more climate-heating carbon emissions than the poorest 10% of their fellow citizens.

Failing to account for this huge wealth-emitting divide when making policies to cut emissions can cause a backlash over the affordability of climate action, experts say.

"Apartment blocks, shops and streets shown above in Gaza City, the Gaza strip’s northern and largest city, lie in ruins amid a humanitarian catastrophe that has killed more than 14,000 Palestinians, according to officials in Gaza.

Since Israel declared a “complete siege” of Gaza in response to Hamas’s 7 October attack, which killed at least 1,200 people, large parts of the territory have been reduced to rubble.

Bombing by the Israeli military followed by a ground invasion have caused a civilian crisis: food, water, fuel and medicines are desperately short, 1.7 million people of Gaza’s 2.3 million population have been displaced, and only 10 out of 36 hospitals are functioning.

In the past 24 hours, a deal has been struck between Hamas and Israel  to release 50 women and children held hostage by Hamas and other groups in Gaza in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children being freed from Israeli jails during a four-day ceasefire, in a deal brokered by Qatar with the support of the US.

A US official said three Americans would be among those freed, including a girl who turns four this week, and that the first release should come by Thursday.

According to Hamas, Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children, from Israeli jails and allow hundreds of aid trucks a day to cross the Rafah border with Egypt, providing humanitarian supplies to Palestinians in Gaza.

Schools were shut and non-essential construction banned in India’s capital earlier this month as the air quality index hit 500 – the highest the measurement will go and 100 times the limit deemed to be healthy by the World Health Organization (WHO).

“Pollution season”, as it is called by those living in the city, is now a recurring event in winter, despite government promises to fix the problem as the weather gets colder and pollutants from vehicles, industry and burning agricultural waste become trapped.

Delhi has been named the most polluted capital city for four consecutive years by the air-quality information platform IQAir.

The people of Delhi could have their lives shortened by 11.9 years due to the poor air they breathe, according to this year’s air-quality life index, compiled by the University of Chicago’s energy policy institute.

"“Since October 7th it’s gotten much, much, much worse,” says 33-year-old Israeli activist Sahar Vardi, describing the increasing settler violence in the West Bank.

Vardi, a conscientious objector and activist who is Jewish Israeli, refused to serve in the Israel Defense Forces 15 years ago when she turned 18. Since then she has been working as an activist, fighting against the occupation of Palestine, and doing “protective presence” shifts.

“Made up of both international activists and Israeli activists, we’re trying to be within Palestinian communities to go with Palestinians to do agricultural work, harvesting, grazing sheep, and to try and just with our presence, decrease the violence of settlers and soldiers,” explains Vardi.

Jewish Israeli settlers believe the West Bank should be Jewish for religious and historical reasons, although the settlements are illegal under international law.

Vardi spoke with the Guardian about what those shifts entail, and why she is calling for an end to Israel’s use of military violence in Gaza.

“For us as Israelis, it’s very hard to call for [a ceasefire] right now. Calling for a ceasefire is still seen as treason,” she says.

Vardi also made a call to people around the world, saying: “The only way to stop it is for the international community to intervene and not just say words and send statements and say that they’re very concerned about humanitarian consequences of Israel’s actions, but to say, ‘we will not allow this’, including if it means cutting support to Israel until Israel agrees to a ceasefire.”

"Do you think these climate solutions are achievable?

Countries are falling behind on almost every policy required to cut greenhouse gas emissions, a new report has found — a failure that makes the chances of keeping global heating below the critical climate thresholds even more remote.

Scientists warned earlier this year that by 2027 the world is likely to reach temperatures 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the target enshrined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement in order to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown.

With action not being taken fast enough to pull the world back from the brink of climate devastation, the State of Climate Action 2023 report has outlined the ‘enormous acceleration’ in efforts required by the world to avoid increasingly dangerous and irreversible climate impacts, including:

⚫ Phasing out coal seven times faster than is happening now
⚫Reducing deforestation four times faster
⚫Building public transport around the world six times faster

Examining all aspects of climate policy from governments across the world, the report found that while some progress had been made with the uptake of green technology and electric vehicles, all other progress – including the continuing public funding of fossil fuels – was ‘woefully inadequate’.

‘Despite decades of dire warnings and wake-up calls, our leaders have largely failed to mobilise climate action anywhere near the pace and scale needed,’ said Sophie Boehm, a research associate at the World Resources Institute and lead author of the report compiled by six climate thinktanks.

‘There’s no time left to tinker at the edges. Instead, we need immediate, transformational changes.’

"The picture above shows premature babies in Gaza’s largest hospital swaddled and laid down seven or eight to a bed in an effort to keep them warm and alive after oxygen supplies and power for their incubators ran out.

Nurses attempted to provide what care they could for 39 babies who were transferred from the neonatal unit in another part of the complex after a strike on al-Shifa hospital’s intensive care unit.

“I am afraid that all of the babies will lose their lives,” said Marwan Abu Sada, the head of surgery at the hospital, which was once considered the heart of Gaza’s healthcare system and is now operating under fire and without power, clean water, or food.

Israel has said it is helping babies and others trapped inside the Gaza City hospital to evacuate, but health officials and people trapped inside said fighting was continuing outside the facility.

The last generator ran out of fuel at the weekend, leading to the deaths of three premature babies and four other patients, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry.

Israel’s military said it had placed 300 litres of fuel near al-Shifa overnight for an emergency generator powering incubators for premature babies. A health ministry spokesperson, Ashraf al-Qidra, told Al Jazeera the fuel would not be enough to operate the generator for an hour.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said on X that al-Shifa was “not functioning as a hospital any more”.

“The world cannot stand silent while hospitals, which should be safe havens, are transformed into scenes of death, devastation, and despair,” said Ghebreyesus.

The Israel Defence Forces have repeatedly said that Hamas operates from bunkers underneath al-Shifa. This is denied by Hamas and hospital staff.

“Al-Shifa is besieged; no one can get out, and no one can enter,” Abu Sada said.

“We are so afraid, so scared of the bombardments. But we must stay here, we are ethically obliged to treat patients, and we cannot leave with our patients still inside. Even if we could, where would we go?”

Ariel Bernstein was 20 years old when he first entered Gaza as a member of the Israel Defence Forces. He says what he saw during the 2014 war, and the destruction he left behind, will forever haunt him.

The war killed 2,251 Palestinians, more than half of them civilians, according to UN figures, and 74 Israelis, including six civilians. The intense fighting over 50 days also reduced swaths of Gaza to piles of rubble.

“Life in Gaza is unsustainable. I have been astounded at how our society refuses to reflect on the situation in Gaza,” says Bernstein. “The 7 October massacre ignited a tribalist ‘us versus them’ instinct among most of us, leaving little space for complexity.”

At a school hosting displaced families in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, the sound of singing and games drowns out the ambulance sirens.

More than 4,000 children have been killed, according to Gaza’s health ministry, and thousands more have lost their homes and had to flee since Israel’s bombardment of Gaza began four weeks ago.

For those who have survived, the psychological impact of the conflict is obvious.

‘The toll of conflict and the blockade on children’s mental health is too great’, says Jason Lee, Save the Children’s country director for the occupied Palestinian territory. ‘We are running out of words to raise the alarm in strong enough terms or to articulate the scale of children’s suffering.’

This is what Alaa Hathleen, a Palestinian resident, told the Guardian as he fears that he and his neighbours are under threat as violence from Israeli settlers and IDF forces has intensified since the Hamas terrorist attacks on 7 October.

Over the past three weeks, he says, settlers have burned down homes and attacked Palestinians residing there.
Palestinian water cisterns, solar panels, roads and buildings are frequently demolished on the grounds that they do not have building permits, which are nearly impossible to obtain, while surrounding illegal Israeli settlements flourish.

Ghunaim, a 24-year-old Palestinian content creator, who is living in southern Gaza has been documenting life under intensifying Israeli bombardment using his social media channel.

“The situation in Gaza is getting worse day after day. The bombing continues day and night in a random and barbaric manner,” @gahnaim said as the constant sound of blasts could be heard nearby.

Israel has since responded with a huge military attack on Gaza, which has so far led to more than 10,000 Palestinians being killed, according to local authority figures, and hundreds of thousands more people being internally displaced.

"The Euclid space telescope has beamed back its first images in a mission that promises to lift a veil on the “dark universe”.

The stunning images from telescope, which can detect galaxies up to 10bn light years away, show the Perseus galaxy cluster and Horsehead nebula and capture approximately 100,000 galaxies in a single snapshot.

The orbital satellite was launched into space in July on a European Space Agency (Esa) mission to create the largest cosmic 3D map ever made, and shed new light on dark energy and dark matter — the mysterious cosmic forces scientists say account for 95% of the known universe.

This will allow astronomers to infer the large-scale distribution of dark matter and reveal the influence of dark energy in the early universe.

Dark matter pervades the universe and acts as a cosmic glue that holds galaxies together, while dark energy is the name given to an enigmatic force that is thought to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.

The Community Security Trust said on Friday it had recorded the highest 28-day total since it started counting in 1984.

Since 7 October, 1,019 hate incidents have been recorded across the UK, the date Hamas launched a series of attacks on Israel that left 1,400 dead, and more than 200 people taken hostage.

The figures include 47 assaults, with other incidents including the targeting of children and schools.

The level of incidents triggered by the current crisis is higher than at other times when Israel has been involved in military action. Incidents reported to the CST include highly offensive remarks about Jewish people, covering schools, colleges and even a Holocaust library.

The Metropolitan police had 657 reports of antisemitic incidents from 1 October to 1 November this year, compared with 49 incidents in the same period last year.

"At least 15 people were killed and 60 injured after an Israeli strike on a convoy of ambulances near Gaza’s biggest hospital, al-Shifa, the Hamas-run health ministry said. 

Video shared on social media, which Reuters has verified, showed people lying in blood next to an ambulance with flashing lights on a city street as people rushed to help. 

Another video showed three ambulances standing in a line, with about a dozen people lying either motionless or barely moving next to them, the news agency reports. Blood was pooled nearby.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PCRS) said its ambulance, carrying an injured 35-year-old, was struck by a missile fired by Israeli forces. 

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out an airstrike on an ambulance which it said was being used by Hamas, adding that “a number of Hamas terrorist operatives” were killed in the strike. It gave no evidence to support its assertion, but said it intended to release additional information.

Hamas official Izzat El Reshiq said allegations its fighters were present were “baseless”.
The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) said he was “utterly shocked by reports of attacks on ambulances evacuating patients”, adding that patients, health workers and medical facilities must be protected.

Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed at least 9,227 Palestinians, including 3,826 children, since 7 October, the Hamas-run health ministry said on Friday. The Israeli offensive on Gaza followed terrorist attacks launched by Hamas into Israel almost four weeks ago which killed 1,400 people.

"“It’s a new Nakba”

After weeks of intense violence including home invasions and threats from Israeli settlers in the aftermath of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October, entire villages on the south Hebron hills in the occupied West Bank have made a collective decision to leave.

Armed settlers – some in reservist army uniforms, some covering their faces – have begun breaking into their homes at night, beating up adults, destroying and stealing belongings, and terrifying the children.

Issa Ahmad Baghdad, 71, has described this as a “new Nakba” referring to the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians in 1948 after the creation of Israel. “My family are going to Rafat. But we don’t know anyone there. We don’t know what to tell the children.”

Following decades of a desperate fight to cling on to their land, the community has decided they have lost. According to Israeli human rights group, B’Tselem, in the last three weeks 858 Palestinians from 32 different communities, and 13 entire communities in total, have been forcibly displaced. The numbers increase every day.

After years of legal battles, Israel’s supreme court ruled last May in favour of the IDF that a 3,000-hectare (7,410-acre) area of Masafer Yatta would remain a military training zone, known as Firing Zone 918, a ruling illegal under international law and one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the occupation began. Since then, the army and Israeli settlers have steadily increased the pressure to try to force the Palestinian community in the Firing Zone, as well as those living in dozens of nearby villages, to leave.

"Israeli airstrikes have destroyed apartment blocks and killed dozens of people at a refugee camp in northern Gaza on the 25th day of a conflict that the United Nations said has become a “graveyard” for children.

At least six airstrikes hit residential areas in the Jabalia refugee camp on Gaza City’s outskirts on Tuesday, killing more than 50 people and injuring about 150 people, Hamas officials said. Video footage showed at least 47 bodies pulled out of the rubble and rescue teams searching for survivors amid twisted metal and two huge craters.

The Israeli military said it had targeted the camp to kill Ibrahim Biari – a key Hamas commander linked to the group’s 7 October attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people. The IDF claims Biari had taken over civilian buildings in Gaza City with his fighters.

At least 8,525 Palestinians, including 3,542 children, have been killed in bombardments in Gaza, according to Hamas health ministry figures issued before the strikes on Jabalia.

"The world’s biggest fossil fuel firms are quietly planning scores of “carbon bomb” oil and gas projects that could destroy the last chance of stopping the planet heating to dangerous levels.

Now, the Guardian can reveal, banks pumped more than $150bn last year into companies whose giant “carbon bomb” projects could drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limit of 1.5C with catastrophic global impacts.

The carbon bombs – 425 extraction projects that can each pump more than one gigaton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – cumulatively hold enough coal, oil and gas to burn through the rapidly dwindling carbon budget four times over.

Between 2016 and 2022, banks mainly in the US, China and Europe gave $1.8tn in financing to the companies running them, new research shows.

The climate rhetoric did not match up with what was happening on the books, said Shruti Shukla, an energy campaigner at the National Resources Defense Council, which was not involved in the investigation. “We need to rapidly decline our production of fossil fuels and support for fossil fuels, whether that’s regulatory or financial.”

When our environment team revealed the carbon bombs last year in an exclusive investigation, scientists thought the remaining carbon budget to give a half chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C was about 500 gigatons of carbon dioxide. But on Monday, leading climate scientists published an update that put the figure at just 250 gigatons. The carbon bombs could release more than 1,000 gigatons over their lifetime.

"Benjamin Netanyahu has just spoken at a briefing, where he described the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October as a “turning point” for leaders and nations.

The Israeli prime minister, speaking in English, says it is time “to decide if we are willing to fight for a future of hope and promise, or surrender to tyranny and terror”.

Israel “did not start this war” but it will win this war, he says. “Israel will stand against the forces of barbarism until victory,” he says.

He says he wants to make clear Israel’s position regarding a ceasefire in Gaza: “Just as the United States would not agree to a ceasefire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or after the terrorist attack of 911, Israel will not agree to a cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attacks of October 7.

“Calls for a ceasefire are a call for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorism, to surrender to barbarism. That will not happen.

“The Bible says that there is a time for peace and a time for war. This is a time for war.”

Asked if Israel is inflicting collective punishment on the people of Palestine, Benjamin Netanyahu says Hamas is preventing civilians in northern Gaza from leaving and forcing them into areas of conflict.

“Not a single civilian has to die,” the Israeli prime minister says. 

He adds: ""We’re going out of our way to prevent civilian casualties, not only by asking civilians to move, calling them to move, arranging a place for them to be which is safe, also putting in humanitarian support, providing them with the means with food, with water, with medicine.""

More than 8,300 Palestinians have been killed in the bombardment in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More children have been killed in Gaza in the past three weeks than the total killed in conflicts around the world in every year since 2019, Save the Children said.

"Matthew Perry, best known for playing Chandler Bing in the hit TV sitcom Friends, has died at 54.

Perry died in an apparent drowning at his home in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, sources including a representative for the actor and law enforcement told NBC News. An official cause of death has yet to be released.

After small roles in Growing Pains, Beverly Hills 90210 and Dream On, Perry scored a role in NBC sitcom Friends in 1994. The comedy, about six friends living in New York City, quickly became a phenomenon, winning multiple Emmys and scoring record ratings.

Perry went on to play Chandler in 10 seasons with the 2004 finale reaching over 52 million viewers in the US, making it the most watched TV episode of the 2000s.

“People come up to me every day and say, ‘Hey Chandler!’ I don’t respond to it,” he said in a 2014 interview. “If somebody says, ‘Hi Matthew, I love your work’, that’s one thing. But if somebody goes ‘Yo, Chandler’, I don’t like that. I’m tired of it. I’m not Chandler.”

Perry was 24 when he started playing Chandler and was relatively unknown, just like his co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer. In a 2019 interview, Friends creator David Crane said Chandler was the most difficult character to cast. 

“Marta [Kauffman, co-creator] and I were thinking Chandler is just poorly written,” added Crane. “Then Matthew came in and you went, ‘Oh, well, there you go. Done. Done. That’s the guy.’”

"Newly released satellite images reveal how cities and towns in Gaza have been destroyed by almost three weeks of Israeli bombardments on the besieged enclave.

Apartment buildings are crumpled and entire neighbourhoods lie in ruins, in pictures taken before and after Israeli airstrikes and provided by Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs.

In Beit Hanoun, which lies close to the northern border with Israel, four- and five-storey buildings are in various states of collapse. Huge chunks are missing from some, others are broken in half and two large complexes lie in piles of rubble.

The city lies close to one of the main crossings through which Hamas militants launched their murderous rampage through southern Israel and has been a focus of much of the Israel Defence Forces’ (IDF) firepower.

Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas, which rules Gaza, in retaliation for the 7 October attacks in which they killed more than 1,400 people and took 229 people hostage.

Since then, Israel has continuously struck Gaza from the air, imposed a siege and is preparing a ground invasion. The Hamas-run health ministry says more than 7,000 people, many of them civilians, have been killed in the Israeli bombardment.

US president Joe Biden has questioned the reliability of the reporting of the death toll, because the health ministry is run by Hamas.

Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch, said: “We’ve looked at satellite imagery. We’ve seen the number of buildings, and the numbers that are coming out are in line with what we would expect with what we’re seeing on the ground.

Although people with dark skin first came to Britain about 12,000 years ago, with the first known people to come directly from Africa settling approximately 2,000 years ago, more than a third of Britons surveyed believed that the first Black people migrated to Britain only in the past 200 years, while one in four believed that it was within the past 100 years.

“I think disbelief is really the only word,” said Atinuke, the author of Brilliant Black British History in response to the survey’s findings.

“There have always been people with black and brown skin in Britain – from the stone age, through every single era, to the present day.”

“More than that, the forced contribution of millions of Black people before and during the Georgian era changed the course of British history – helping Britain to become the first industrialised nation in the world, and a superpower.”

Atinuke has called for the government to drive more integration of Black British history in schools and universities, noting that, “as our world becomes more polarised and divided, increased inclusivity is needed now more than ever. All British history needs to be taught as one history. It’s all our history.”

"“I thought I was gone”

James Breen was wingfoiling at Mona Vale beach in Australia when a humpback whale soared out of the water and landed on top of him, dragging him about 20 to 30 ft below the surface. His GoPro captured the dramatic moment on camera. 

As he wrestled underwater, he said he could feel the smooth skin of the whale, leading him to believe it was a juvenile. After his leg rope snapped, he clawed his way back to the surface and made his way to the shore safely.

"‘What’s the worst that can happen?”

That is what Georgia Harrison asked herself one Sunday morning in August 2020 when Stephen Bear, who lived opposite, invited her over for a cup of tea.

They knew each other through the reality television and influencer circuits. She had been on The Only Way Is Essex (Towie) and Love Island; he had done Shipwrecked, Ex on the Beach, then won Celebrity Big Brother. They had hooked up before and he hadn’t treated her well.

“We’d been in lockdown and I was definitely quite lonely, feeling quite rubbish about myself,” says Harrison, 28. “I knew that going to Bear’s was a bad idea – there were two voices in my head. In the end, I thought: what’s the worst that could happen? Well, now we know.”

Bear filmed them having drunken sex - and afterwards he casually that it might have been caught on his CCTV system. When he showed her the footage and she began to cry (“I’ll die if anyone sees it,” she said), he promised to delete the video.

Instead, three months later, Bear posted the footage on his verified Only Fans account. Within days, it was all over the internet, including the website Pornhub. “Georgia Harrison sex tape” had become a top search on Google.

Harrison found out when a fan in the US sent her a screenshot asking: “Have you seen this?” Her reaction was to gag. But she picked herself up and went to the police.

Bear was arrested, charged and convicted. In March 2023, he was sentenced to 21 months in prison for voyeurism and sharing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress.

Now, @georgialouiseharrison has waived her right to anonymity to help the many women similarly affected - and has written a memoir about her experience, Taking Back My Power.

"Footage has emerged of the 85-year-old hostage Yocheved Lifshitz shaking hands with one of her Hamas captors and saying “shalom”, a Hebrew greeting meaning “peace”, after being released back to her family.

Lifshitz was released alongside 79-year-old Nurit Cooper on Monday night. The two women were taken out of Gaza at the Rafah crossing into Egypt, where they were put into ambulances, according to footage shown on Egyptian TV.

The two women and their husbands were snatched from their homes in the kibbutz of Nir Oz near the Gaza border during Hamas’s rampage into southern Israeli communities on 7 October. Their husbands, who are 83 and 84, were not released.

Hamas apparently received nothing in exchange for the release of the hostages, who were freed days after an American woman and her teenage daughter were also released. Hamas and other militants in Gaza are believed to have taken about 220 people, including an unconfirmed number of foreigners and dual citizens.

At least 400 Palestinians were killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The Israeli military said it had hit more than 320 'military targets' and that ground forces had conducted 'limited raids' to kill gunmen and search for hostages.

The conflict broke out after Hamas militants attacked southern Israeli communities, killing 1,400 people and taking 222 Israelis into Gaza as hostages. Gaza's health authority has said at least 4,600 people have been killed in Israel's two-week bombardment.

"Sir Bobby Charlton, one of the greatest footballers of all time and the most storied player England has produced, has died aged 86. 

A statement from the Charlton family said: “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Sir Bobby passed peacefully in the early hours of Saturday morning. He was surrounded by his family.”

“Manchester United are in mourning following the passing of Sir Bobby Charlton, one of the greatest and most beloved players in the history of our club,” a club statement said. “Sir Bobby was a hero to millions, not just in Manchester, or the UK, but wherever football is played around the world.”

“He was admired as much for his sportsmanship and integrity as he was for his outstanding qualities as a footballer; Sir Bobby will always be remembered as a giant of the game,” the statement added. “The club’s heartfelt sympathies are with his wife Lady Norma, his daughters and grandchildren, and all who loved him.”

A World Cup winner with England in 1966, Charlton spent his playing career almost entirely at Manchester United, where the trophies he secured included three league titles and a European Cup.

Charlton went on to become a director at Old Trafford and was knighted in June 1994. A survivor of the Munich air disaster, which claimed the lives of eight of his clubmates in 1958, he made 758 appearances for United, a record which stood until surpassed by Ryan Giggs.

Charlton scored 249 goals for the club, a record which was later surpassed by Wayne Rooney, and was England’s all-time leading scorer, with 49, until Rooney overtook him in 2015.

Footage shows the children, who were covered in blankets, waiting beneath the debris.

The Gaza health ministry says at least 3,478 Palestinians have been killed in airstrikes since 7 October.

Israel says its strikes on Gaza target Palestinian militant groups and has accused Hamas fighters of taking shelter among the civilian population.

Israel security officials have signalled their readiness to embark on a ground offensive into Gaza that they say will be far more comprehensive and ferocious than any previous conflict with Hamas.

Israel’s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, visited troops on the Gaza border on Thursday, telling them: “You see Gaza now from a distance, you will soon see it from inside. The command will come"".

The threat of an all-out ground war looms just as there was some hope of humanitarian relief reaching the 2.3 million trapped Palestinians, who have been cut off from water, food and medical supplies for the past 12 days.

The UN high commissioner for refugees has warned that further military escalation will be “catastrophic for the people of Gaza”.

"This image shows a grief-stricken woman in Khan Younis with her arms wrapped around the body of a Palestinian child who was killed in an Israeli air strike.

At least 49 Palestinians were killed in strikes that hit homes in Rafah and Khan Younis on Tuesday, Gaza’s interior ministry said.

And in the evening, the Gaza health ministry, which is run by Hamas, said 471 Palestinian were killed in a massive explosion at a crowded hospital in Gaza City. It was the biggest single loss of life in the blockaded territory in all the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007.

Officials in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike. Israel has denied it was involved and released video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a missile misfire by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. The Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim, and the scale of the blast appeared to be outside the militant groups’ capabilities.

The bombardment on Gaza has continued without relenting since Hamas launched its surprise attack on southern Israel 12 days ago, which killed more than 1,300 Israelis.

During a visit to Tel Aviv today, the US president, Joe Biden, said Hamas “committed evils and atrocities that make Isis somewhat more rational”, and before leaving the country cautioned Israelis not to be consumed by rage, adding that the vast majority of Palestinians were not affiliated with the militant group.

"“This was a massacre” said Dr Gassan Abu Sitteh on social media, after witnessing the horrific blast at al-Ahli hospital in Gaza.

Hundreds of people are reported to have been killed in a massive explosion at the crowded hospital in Gaza City, in the biggest single loss of life in the blockaded territory in all the five wars between Hamas and Israel since the militants took over the strip in 2007.

More than 300 casualties were taken in ambulances and private cars to Gaza City’s main hospital, al-Shifa, which was already overwhelmed with the wounded. Videos show injured people laying on bloody floors, screaming in pain.

"Australia has overwhelmingly voted no to recognising Indigenous people in its constitution and enshrining a First Nations voice to parliament on matters that affect them.

Saturday’s voice to parliament referendum failed, with the defeat becoming clear shortly after polls closed.

To succeed, the yes campaign – advocating for the change – needed to secure a double majority, meaning it needed a majority of the national vote, as well as majorities in four of Australia’s six states.

The defeat will be seen by Indigenous advocates as a blow to what has been a hard-fought struggle to make progress on reconciliation and recognition in modern Australia, with First Nations people continuing to suffer discrimination and poorer health and economic outcomes.

"‘The majority of the US wants this’

On a 17-acre site in Phoenix, Arizona, that once contained a car body shop and some largely derelict buildings, an unusual experiment has emerged that invites Americans to live in a way that is rare outside of their fleeting experiences of college or trips to Europe: a walkable community devoid of cars.

Culdesac ushered in its first 36 residents earlier this year and will eventually house around 1,000 people when the full 760 units, arranged in two- and three-story buildings, are completed by 2025.

Neighborhoods of this ilk are often prohibitively expensive. However, the $170m Culdesac project shows “we can build walkable neighborhoods successfully in the US in [the] 2020s,” according to Ryan Johnson, the 40-year-old who co-founded the community with Jeff Berens, a former McKinsey consultant.

Over the past century, huge highways have been plowed through the heart of US cities. These roads have primarily served a sprawling suburbia, composed almost entirely of single-family homes with spacious back yards where car driving is often the only option to get anywhere.

“The result is a nation in which we are all ruthlessly separated from most of our daily needs and also from each other,” Jeff Speck, a city planner and urban designer, said.
Culdesac can be seen, then, as not only a model for a more climate-friendly community, but as a way of somehow stitching back together communities that have become physically, socially and politically riven, lacking a “third place” to congregate other than dislocated homes and workplaces.

Johnson said he is planning to bring the concept to other cities. “This is something that the majority of the US wants, so they can work all over the country,” he said.

"Have you seen a bedbug yet?

Bedbug panic has swept across Paris and is making its way over the channel to London - after videos of the insects infesting both cities went viral.

But do we actually need to worry about it?

Some experts however are saying that the problem isn’t new and that the amount of bedbugs in London has been growing year on year.

David Cain, a microbiologist who’s been exterminating the bed bugs for two decades, explains they were incredibly common in the early 20th century, but because of powerful insecticide used a lot during and after the second world war, rates of infestations fell dramatically around the world.

For decades, bedbugs were thought to be a thing of the past – they became so rare that people could no longer identify them and pest-control professionals weren’t equipped to fight them.

But since the early 2000s, they have returned - thanks to regular international travel, increasing immunity to insecticides, warmer climates and overcrowded living conditions.

The images above show only some of the horror, suffering and grief that has unfolded this week, as the latest brutal conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas continues to claim victims.

More than 1,300 people have been killed in Israel, according to the military. More than 1,500 Palestinians have been killed and a further 6,612 wounded by Israeli strikes since Saturday, Gaza’s health ministry said on Thursday. 

The UN’s human rights office has called for restraint on both sides. However, with nearly half of Gaza’s 2.3 million citizens warned by Israel to evacuate before a likely ground assault – an order the UN says will spark 'devastating humanitarian consequences' – the tragedy of the last week looks unlikely to end soon.

"‘We feel trapped’

Dozens of current and former Amazon workers have claimed unfair practices by the brand and labor agents involved in their employment.

The accusations include abusive working and living conditions, restrictions on movement, and false promises about wages, working conditions and the identity of the employer.

The workers' accounts provide insight into how major US corporations profit, directly or indirectly, from employment practices that may amount to labor trafficking, which is defined as using force, coercion or fraud to induce someone to work or provide service.

Forty-eight of the 54 Nepali workers interviewed by the Guardian say recruiters misled them about the terms of their employment, falsely promising they would work directly for Amazon.

During their time in Saudi Arabia, these workers say they were paid a fraction of what direct hires for Amazon’s Saudi warehouses earn, because labor supply firms were taking big cuts of what Amazon was paying for their labor.

Some say that after they’d been laid off from work at Amazon, their labor supply company sought to squeeze more money out of them, taking advantage of Saudi laws that give employers broad powers to control foreign workers’ freedom of movement.

One such worker is Momtaj Mansur. After he lost his Amazon job he was given the choice of staying in a place he describes as “like a hell”, or pushing his family back in Nepal deeper into destitution by paying a $1,300 exit fee.

“I told them: either kill us or send us home, but don’t give us so much pain,” he says.

A current Amazon worker said: “We have already paid money to come here and we have to pay additional money to return? We feel trapped.”

In a written reply to questions for this story, Amazon acknowledged that some workers at its Saudi facilities had been mistreated. It said it will make sure that workers who paid recruiting fees get their money back and it was “implementing stronger controls” to “ensure similar incidents do not occur and to raise overall standards for workers in the region”.

"“I lost my whole life,” says a woman who lost her two grandchildren after a powerful series of earthquakes hit a densely populated area in the Herat province.

People in the area have spent a second night sleeping amid the rubble and searching for their loved ones using shovels and their bare hands.

Afghanistan is already in the grip of a humanitarian crisis, with the widespread withdrawal of foreign aid after the Taliban’s return to power in 2021, which has had a severe impact on its healthcare system. The group also has fractious relations with international aid organisations after banning women from working for the UN and NGOs.

The International Rescue Committee warned the lack of rescue equipment could push up the death toll in western Afghanistan because trapped survivors cannot be freed.

Aid agencies and NGOs have appealed for help from the international community. Aid from Iran and Turkey has so far arrived in the area, according to the Taliban.

"It’s been over 48 hours since an attack by Hamas sparked the latest brutal conflict between Israel and the Palestinian militant group which rules the Gaza Strip.

Israel has declared a “complete siege” of Gaza, cutting off water, food and power supplies, as Hamas militants threatened to start killing Israeli civilian hostages if the bombing of civilian areas in the enclave continued without prior warning.

Palestinian militants abducted more than 100 people during a surprise multi-front attack in which they killed more than 700 – making Saturday the deadliest day in Israel’s history. Israeli media said on Monday the death toll had climbed to 900, with 2,616 injured.

In response, Israel has pounded the Palestinian enclave of Gaza, killing hundreds of people in retaliation. The death toll in Gaza has risen to 560, with 2,900 injured, according to Palestinian authorities.

"“I was … breathing, saying: ‘OK, I’m going to die. It’s OK, just breathe, just close your eyes.’”

This is how Gili Yoskovich described feeling as she played dead for three hours to dodge the gunfire and killings when Hamas militants attacked the music festival she was at.

“I saw people were dying all around. I was very quiet. I didn’t cry, I didn’t do anything,” she told the BBC.

Supernova music festival in Israel began at about 10pm on Friday, three miles from the Gaza frontier. At dawn, hundreds of people were still partying when Hamas militants launched its largest attack in decades, catching the Israeli government and military completely off guard.

As the festivalgoers partied, several small black dots appeared in the sky, caught on one partygoer’s phone. As the dots came closer, it became clear they were motorised paragliders.

“Suddenly out of nowhere they [militants] come inside with gunfire, opening fire in every direction. Fifty terrorists arrived in vans, dressed in military uniforms,” festival attendee Ortel told Israel’s Channel 12.

Rescuers say about 260 people had been killed and many were still missing, with videos circulating showing young Israelis being driven and marched away by gunmen.

"“The way we raise kids and the information we expose them to helps to shape the people they become,” says author Nic Stone.

She wrote her book, Dear Martin - a young adult novel about police brutality and racism in the US - because she said she felt it was painfully necessary to give it to her sons. 

Then dozens of schools across the country started to ban the book.

Over the last school year, book bans in US public schools have increased by 33%, particularly in states like Florida, according to a study by the non-profit Pen America.

The authors whose books were targeted were “most frequently female, people of colour, and/or LGBTQ+ individuals”, the report - which coincided with the American Library Association’s annual Banned Books Week – also found.

That’s what resident Volodymyr Mukhovaty, 70, told reporters in Kharkiv, northeastern Ukraine; a region that has been hit by two Russian air strikes in less than 24 hours.

Thursday’s attack on the village of Hroza was one of the deadliest single strikes on civilians since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine - and it affected people from “every family” of the village.

Friday’s strike hit Kharkiv’s densely populated downtown area. Two Iskander missiles hit a block of flats, in what Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called another act of “Russian terror”.

"“We feel part of a cruel game”

The Bibby Stockholm, the barge that the Home Office wants to use to accommodate 500 of the more than 100,000 asylum seekers currently in the UK, has been plagued by controversy from the beginning.

With cabins the size of a prison cell, the vessel would house people in “detention-like conditions”, campaigners say. The NGO One Life to Live has described it as a “floating Grenfell” due to the risk of fire.

But the barge has been empty since 11 August when asylum seekers, who had been onboard for just four days, were evacuated after the discovery of deadly legionella bacteria.

Those who were moved back into hotels said they could not cope with the living conditions. They said they were scared about their health, stressed and were “struggling mentally”.

So far, ministers haven’t kept their promise to reduce the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by speeding up applications and bringing in the use of cheaper accommodation, such as barges.

More than 175,000 people were waiting for a decision on whether they would be granted refugee status at the end of June, up 44% from last year. And in the meantime, the cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels has risen to £8m a day.

A Home Office spokesperson has said: “The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority and we are working closely with external partners and Dorset and Wiltshire fire service to further improve safety measures on the vessel.”

"'Time doesn’t heal you. All that time does is give you the strength to manage it better'

It was late June in 2015 when tourism lecturer Suzanne Richards arrived home after a class. The house was quiet because the previous evening she had waved her teenage sons, Owen and Joel, off on “a jolly boys' outing” to Tunisia with her brother Adrian and her father, Pat.

“An unknown number flashed up on my phone. Normally I wouldn’t answer, but for some reason I did,” she recalls. “And that was when I heard Owen screaming: ‘There’s a gunman and they’re all dead!’ He was so distressed that I initially couldn’t tell which son was speaking. Then we were cut off.”

She immediately called the number back but couldn’t get through. Messages started pinging from friends and family, asking if she had seen the news.

A terrorist had entered the Hotel Imperial Marhaba via the pool area and started firing at people. Among the gunman's 38 victims were Joel, Adrian and Pat.

Eight years on, she remembers that terrible day, and the sense of purpose she found in the aftermath.

“It’s a cliche maybe, but I’ve realised that life is short and you only get one chance at it.”

Still, she says “I ask myself every day: why did it happen? What has [the shooter] gained from doing that apart from ripping 38 families apart? I don’t get it and I never will get it.”

Although they had counseling, Suzanne says both she and Owen believe you have to learn to manage loss yourself, adding: “I live for the fact that I’m going to see them again.

“If I knew that I wasn’t going to see them again, that would be a struggle, so I choose to live with the fact that I will. I really hope that they are watching us and everything we are doing.”

"“I’m homeless again”, said the London jewellery designer Isabelle White, after finding out the new apartment complex she moved into three weeks ago could be demolished. 

Isabelle was on her way for a haircut when she first learned the news from the Guardian’s social affairs correspondent, Robert Booth. 

“It seemed too good to be true and now obviously it is. Moving in I thought there were a lot of things that didn’t make sense,” she said.

Earlier that day, Greenwich council had announced that the developer, Comer Homes Group, must raze the buildings because of 26 major changes from the originally agreed plan. The council called it a “mutant development that is a blight on the landscape”.

Comer Homes said it would appeal against the decision and said it was “extremely disappointed” with the move. 

The complex only opened last year in a borough with a social housing waiting list of more than 20,000 households. Demolition and rebuilding could cost more than £160m, an industry source estimated.

Rima is one of thousands of ethnic Armenians who have left their homes over the last few days in an attempt to reach the border town of Goris.

Many of those aiming to cross into Armenia via the Lachin corridor, which has been blocked for 10 months by Azerbaijani forces, have already been forced from their homes in past conflicts. 

Approximately 42,500 people – about 35% of Nagorno-Karabakh’s population – are thought to have fled so far. But it is expected that number could swell to up to 120,000 people.

"The prospects of the world staying within the 1.5C limit on global heating have brightened owing to the “staggering” growth of renewable energy and green investment in the past two years, the chief of the world’s energy watchdog has said.

The 1.5C limit stems from the Paris agreement, which contains two key goals of limiting global heating to “well below” 2C, while “pursuing efforts” to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, and the world’s foremost energy economist, said much more needed to be done but that the rapid uptake of solar power and electric vehicles were encouraging in meeting this goal.

“Despite the scale of the challenges, I feel more optimistic than I felt two years ago,” he said in an interview. “Clean energy investments in the last two years have seen a staggering 40% increase.”

Due to solar and electric vehicle sales staying “in line with what they should be,” Birol said the world is on track to reach net zero by 2050.

But Birol also noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector were “still stubbornly high”, and that the extreme weather seen around the world this year had shown the climate was already changing “at frightening speed”.

"This is Aditi Shankar and she’s received the UK’s first rejection free kidney … and it was given by her mum!

In a pioneering treatment, eight-year-old Aditi has been spared from taking life-long drugs to stop her body rejecting her kidney transplant.

Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital say the breakthrough was made possible by “reprogramming” Aditi Shankar’s immune system with stem cells before giving her the new kidney.

Because the bone marrow transplant and kidney came from the same donor – her mother – the new kidney is working without the need for drugs that stop the body from rejecting a donated organ.

Aditi is nowable to swim, sing, dance and play on her trampoline.

“My mum gave me my new blood cells,” said Aditi. “I got the kidney transplant when I went to special sleep and closed my eyes. Now I have got the line out, I can go swimming.”

Aditi’s favourite class in school is science and she has a keen interest in biology after learning so much about the human body during her time in hospital.

Her father, Uday, 48, said: “Most of the support for the family has come from Aditi. She was going in for six to eight hours a day of dialysis and then she would come home and still light the whole house up.”

In a note to staff first reported in the Murdoch-controlled Wall Street Journal, he wrote: “For my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change. But the time is right for me to take on different roles.”

After decades of wrangling and the smash-hit television drama series Succession that appeared to mirror all too closely the power struggles of the Murdoch business clan, one of the most powerful media and, by extension, political figures of the 20th and 21st centuries is handing over the keys to his eldest son Lachlan. His younger son, James, resigned from the News Corp board in 2020.

Murdoch’s publicly-traded company News Corp, headquartered in New York, owns hundreds of local, national and international news outlets. In the US the company owns the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post conservative-leaning tabloid, as well as the book publisher HarperCollins. In the UK he owns The Sun and The Times and owned the News of the World.

In the television business, News Corp also owns the US’s right-wing channel Fox News, through the Fox Corporation, and, down under, Sky News Australia. Murdoch was the owner of Britain’s Sky News until 2018 and the film company now called 21st Century Fox until 2019.

That’s equivalent to the size of Warwickshire or Wiltshire police forces (for those who know England’s counties well).

An overhaul of culture and standards within the Met, prompted by the crimes of serial rapist David Carrick and Wayne Couzens, who was convicted of the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, has led to 100 dismissals for gross misconduct in the last 12 months, a 66% increase on historical averages, the force said.

But it will take “two or more years to root out those who are corrupting policing,” said the Met’s deputy assistant commissioner Stuart Cundy, who has been leading the reforms.

He added that a “paradox” in the process meant the harder they worked, the more cases of misconduct and possible criminality would be uncovered.

Since the conviction of Carrick, a serving officer unmasked as one of the worst serial sex offenders in the UK, 1,600 cases have been identified where officers had faced allegations of domestic or sexual violence over the past 10 years but no action was taken.

There are about 450 investigations into the cases that were reviewed and the most serious of all the cases reviewed involved rape allegations.

"“They want to erase women from society”

This is how one student has described Iran’s new chastity and hijab bill, which is awaiting approval by authorities. Under the draft law women face up to 10 years in prison if they continue to defy the country’s mandatory hijab law.

The stricter dress code, which amounts to “gender apartheid”, UN experts said, comes exactly one year after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini. The 22-year-old was allegedly beaten by police for wearing the Islamic headscarf incorrectly. 

Her death on 16 September led to the largest wave of popular unrest for years in Iran and a brutal crackdown by security services in response, with hundreds of men, women and children killed and thousands more injured, according to human rights groups.

Now the proposed legislation threatens to silence women even more by classifying the failure to wear a headscarf as a more severe offence, punishable with the same jail time as murders or drug traffickers, says Hossein Raeesi, an Iranian human rights lawyer. “That’s ridiculous to even think about.”

Concerned activists have said the regime’s new law would “weaponise public morals”, denying women and girls their freedom of expression. Some women have said they fear their lives will become an open prison. But will this stop them from risking their lives and protesting against Iran’s oppressive regime? Many think not. 

Journalist Deepa Parent explains the Islamic Republic’s plans – and how they hope to silence women across Iran.

"What do you think about American XL bullies?

The dog breed is set become the first breed to be banned in the UK since the introduction of the Dangerous Dogs Act in 1991, prime minister Rishi Sunak announced today, after a series of attacks.

Sunak says the dogs are ‘a danger to our communities’ and he had asked ministers to work with police and experts to define the breed — American XL bully dogs currently are a breed defined in law — “with a view to outlawing it” by the end of the year.

The campaigner Emma Whitfield, whose 10-year-old son, Jack Lis, was killed by an XL bully in south Wales in 2021, said in response to the announcement: “I’m sobbing. I’m sat on my own sobbing. I don’t even have words right now.”

However, the announcement has been met with mixed reactions. The Dog Control Coalition, said: “The view of all leading animal charities is that the solution is not banning more types.

“Instead, the government needs to focus on the improvement and enforcement of current breeding and dog control regulations, and on promoting responsible dog ownership and training.”

But how dangerous is this breed? And is banning them the right move? Watch our science reporter, Madeleine Finlay explain.",2023-09-15 21:11:24
"“We have only one [an]other in this difficult situation. Let’s stand together until we drown.”

These are the chilling words Libyan poet, Mustafa al-Trabelsi, wrote on his Facebook page, before he died in the catastrophic floods that have killed tens of thousands of people in his country.

On the night of the deadly storm in, at 7.44pm, Mustafa, wrote on his Facebook page: “The scenes are scary, and things may escalate to a disaster, and we are under the rule of a corrupt tyrant who has nothing but data, claiming to be prepared and, in fact, does not have any equipment, and rescue teams are only few.

“May God help the families all over our beloved country.”

Officials in the port city of Derna including the mayor, Abdulmenam al-Ghaithi, believe 20,000 people may have died. At least 5,500 people have been confirmed dead.

Footage on social media showed the terror of late Sunday night as children and women scrambled in the darkness with phone torchlights to climb stairs to higher floors away from the raging water.

One man described how the foundations of buildings seven floors high were uprooted within seconds as if a tornado had hit them, sending them into the sea.

Khaled Mattawa, a Libyan writer who translated Mustafa’s poem, said the response and the generosity across Libya had been “heartbreaking”: people in Misrata offering apartments, a mechanic in Sebha offering free tyres and repairs for those heading to help in Derna, a woman offering to adopt babies, recent mothers offering to breastfeed foundlings and orphans. All incredible acts of generosity, but, he said, ultimately all futile.”

"“I’m trying not to cry, thinking about it, to be honest,” said Patsy Stevenson, pictured above being pinned to the floor by officers as she was arrested in a now-infamous photo that sparked widespread fury at the Met police.

“But I don’t believe [the apology] marks any real change … The vigil itself should have been a moment where [the Met] decided to change things and hold themselves accountable.”

Scotland Yard has apologised and paid “substantial” damages to Patsy Stevenson and Dania Al-Obeid, who were arrested during a vigil for Sarah Everard. Everard was kidnapped, raped and murdered by a serving Met police officer in March 2021, when Covid restrictions were in place.

The force acknowledged that it was understandable that Patsy Stevenson and Dania Al-Obeid had wanted to attend a candlelit vigil at Clapham Common because they felt women had been “badly let down”.

This payout represents a major climbdown following years of legal battles over the policing of the event. The Met’s actions at the vigil saw it and its then commissioner, Cressida Dick, widely criticised.

“I will continue speaking out about the abuse that goes on in police forces"" said Al-Obeid, who was handcuffed and arrested at the vigil. She discovered that she had been convicted behind closed doors under the Single Justice Procedure (SJP) only after being contacted by the media.

“They have both overcome significant adversities in their attempts to hold the Met police accountable, and in full public view. I hope other women, particularly survivors of physical and sexual violence, will feel strengthened in their efforts to do the same,” said Rachel Harger, a solicitor at Bindmans LLP who represented Stevenson and Al-Obeid.

"‘The figures are massive,’ said a Libyan medical worker after being asked about the latest death toll following a catastrophic flood killed thousands of people and swept many out to sea.

He said the total could exceed 10,000 but there are fears as many as 20,000 people have died.

Rescue workers in the devastated Libyan city of Derna have appealed for more body bags and international aid is slowly starting to reach the port city after Storm Daniel hit the northern coast of Libya on Saturday night.

“Bodies are everywhere, inside houses, in the streets, at sea. Wherever you go, you find dead men, women, and children,” Emad al-Falah, an aid worker from Benghazi, told the Associated Press over the phone from Derna. “Entire families were lost.”

The death toll in the city could reach 18,000 to 20,000 based on the number of districts destroyed by the flood, the mayor of Derna, Abdulmenam Al-Ghaithi told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television.

"After 12 years of civil war, protests have been flaring up again in Syria. Behind them is the Druze community, a religious minority group based in Suwayda, a government-held city that remained largely neutral during most of Syria’s long conflict. 

But after President Bashar al-Assad cut fuel subsidies, driving up the cost of living, people took to the streets to denounce his policies in a country where the economy was already battered by high inflation and the civil war.

As protests spread across the south of Syria, demonstrators in Suwayda and surrounding areas have become bolder in calling for Assad to go. Some have been seen pulling down posters of the president on the streets of their city. Others, in the town of Melh, in the east of Suwayda province, welded shut the doors of the ruling Ba’ath party.

Assad has been enjoying renewed international diplomatic support and is keen to be recognised as the victor in the conflict. In May, he was seen attending an Arab League summit in Jeddah for the first time since Syria was suspended over a crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 which helped spark the country’s civil war.

In this video Asmaa al-Omar, a journalist based in Istanbul, argues Assad’s problems are far from over if frustration over his handling of the country and economy continues to grow.

At New Ground there are 25 flats with 26 residents. Homes overlook a garden blooming with wildflowers, berries and an orchard. The common meeting room is used for weekly dinners, film nights and yoga classes.

The women manage everything themselves and tasks are divided up among teams of volunteers responsible for maintenance, gardening, communications, cleaning and legal issues.

“The women who started this were adamant that they didn’t want to sit in a day-room singing Daisy Daisy and Pack Up Your Troubles for the rest of their lives,” says Maria Brenton, UK Cohousing Network’s senior ambassador. “We were fiercely opposed to the ageism and paternalism, the infantilisation of older people by social care services.”

The court’s decision is part of a growing trend across Latin America, and is in stark contrast to the nationwide rollback of reproductive rights currently underway in the US.

"An undercover police officer used his fake identity to deceive a woman into a 19-year relationship in which they became partners and had a child together, the Guardian can reveal. The officer concealed his real identity from the woman for the duration of that period, never telling her his real occupation, and using his fictitious identity on the birth certificate of their son.

In 2020, after the couple were engaged to be married, the woman discovered that her fiance, whom she believed to be a businessman, was in fact a police officer who had subjected her to a sophisticated deception lasting almost two decades.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating senior officers at Avon and Somerset police, who knew about the undercover officer’s relationship with the woman as far back as 2013.

They appear to have waited at least seven years before informing the woman that the person she knew as her fiance had been using a fake identity given to him for use in covert police operations. In a statement, the IOPC confirmed it was investigating the case.

Mary and her family have for the last three years wrestled with how to respond to such devastating news. Her siblings say that Avon and Somerset police have consistently put pressure on them not to speak publicly about the relationship, warning of the risk of social unrest if the news got out.

Avon and Somerset police did not respond to repeated requests for comment prior to publication. However, on Wednesday, the force issued an apology.
 
A spokesperson said: “... We fully recognise for those involved it has been deeply upsetting over a number of years, and remains so today. We are sorry. We recognise and understand the devastating and appalling impact this has had on all those affected, and we have taken and continue to take our duty of care to them extremely seriously.”

She deploys social media with enviable authenticity; she grills congressional witnesses like a seasoned interrogator; she is an object of perverse fascination for Fox News and rightwing trolls; she has been around Washington long enough to draw charges of “co-option” and “selling out”.

This is truly about having a strong front against fascism in the United States.”

Overtourism has long been a problem across the world’s travel hotspots – but now besieged cities are starting to fight back.

In the 20 years running up to Covid, international tourism doubled, to 2.4 billion arrivals in 2019. Overall, tourism last year was at 63% of its pre-Covid levels. Numbers this year are expected to be almost exactly as they were four years ago, 38.5 million.

Every location has a different challenge with tourists. On Catalan beaches, it may be that they are wearing too many clothes; in Barcelona, there are simply too many people. Whether that turns the entire place into a giant hotel or a human traffic-jam, it is impossible to imagine that being a pleasant, livable experience for the host citizens.

“I’ve experienced a lot of emotional turmoil over having all these feelings … that I felt like I couldn’t express, especially in my job,” Rodrigo said.

“I’ve always felt like: you can never admit it, be so grateful all the time, so many people want this position. And that causes a lot of repressed feelings.”

"The Spanish football federation’s regional presidents have demanded that Luis Rubiales “immediately resign”, pulling support for the football chief days after its members heartily applauded his vow to stay on.

More than a week after Spanish football’s most powerful executive grabbed forward Jenni Hermoso by the head and planted a kiss on her lips, the federation’s regional presidents were summoned to an “extraordinary and urgent” meeting in Madrid on Monday to assess the impact of the crisis.

Six hours later they emerged, publishing a unanimous joint statement: “After the latest events and the unacceptable behaviours that have seriously damaged the image of Spanish football, we request that Mr Luis Rubiales immediately present his resignation as president of the Spanish football federation.”

The demand was a seeming reversal from the scene that had played out at the federation’s meeting on Friday, where Rubiales, 46, repeated “I will not resign” five times to vigorous applause from the members in attendance. His speech, which railed at “fake feminism”, was met with a standing ovation.

Rubiales has sought to portray the kiss as consensual, claiming he had asked Hermoso if he could give her a peck and that she had replied: “OK.” @jennihermoso later rejected any suggestion that the kiss was consensual. She described Rubiales’s words as “categorically false”.

She said the situation had left her feeling “vulnerable and a victim of aggression”. In her statement she described the kiss as “an impulsive act, sexist, out of place and without any type of consent from my part. In short, I wasn’t respected.”

In the fallout from the incident, all 23 players who won the World Cup have agreed that they would not play for Spain until there was change - and here are three ways their fellow footballers and their supporters have stood behind them.

"‘If I am destined to sacrifice myself for the love of my homeland, I will gladly accept it’

In July, Finn Lau, a pro-democracy activist from Hong Kong living in exile in London, woke up to urgent messages from friends.

Finn was told that he and seven other overseas activists had HK$1m bounties out for their arrest. Hong Kong chief executive John Lee said these dissidents would be pursued ‘to the ends of the Earth’. 

Just days after the announcement, officers began showing up at the homes of many of the activists' families in Hong Kong, taking away parents, siblings, children and in-laws for questioning.

Finn said he was not surprised.

In 2019, he was a leading figure in Hong Kong’s mass protests, where an estimated quarter of the region’s population took to the streets against what they described as an erosion of Hong Kong’s freedom from Beijing control. 

For years, he has been wanted by Hong Kong police.

Now, faced with what he says is increased international oppression from China, even in the UK, Finn no longer feels safe.

"Ivy Snitzer was Gwyneth Paltrow’s body double for the role of Rosemary in 2001’s Shallow Hal.

At the time, 20-year-old Snitzer was a Los Angeles-based acting student with aspirations to become an actor or comedian. “Mostly, I just wanted to be funny,” she says.

Snitzer has zero negative memories of shooting the movie. The cast and crew “treated me like I really mattered”, she says, “like they couldn’t make the movie without me”. Snitzer was made to “feel really comfortable” when her body was being filmed.

However, as she promoted the movie’s release with TV and magazine interviews, she soon realized that strangers took her moment in the spotlight as an open invitation to approach her on the street.

Many were angry that Snitzer had said, “It is not the worst thing in the world to be fat”; some claimed she was promoting obesity. 

One person found her address and sent her diet pills. There were love letters, too – someone mailed her a symphony they had composed especially for her.

“I got really scared,” she says. “I was like: maybe I’m done with the concept of fame, maybe I don’t want to be an actor. Maybe I’ll do something else.”

Less than two years after Shallow Hal was released, Snitzer says she was “technically starving to death”. In 2003, she had gastric band surgery, which reduced the size of her stomach and restricted what she could eat. But shortly after the procedure, the band slipped.

“I was so thin you could see my teeth through my face and my skin was all grey,” she says. “Humans shouldn’t have to experience how very bleak that particular time in my life was.”

However, 22 years after appearing in Shallow Hal, Snitzer is still coming to terms with its impact on her life.

"Why is Japan pumping 1m tonnes of radioactive wastewater – equivalent to around 500 Olympic pools – into the ocean … and is it safe?

Twelve years ago, a huge earthquake struck off Japan’s north-east coast, triggering a tsunami that caused the worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl. More than a decade later, the clean-up continues at Fukushima.

This week the Japanese government started to begin the process of pumping more than one million tonnes of water into the sea from the destroyed Daiichi nuclear power plant, in a move that has prompted horror from environmental groups and consternation in neighbouring countries.

"The lunar south pole, hidden from Earth’s view, has been described as an area of “mystery, science and intrigue”.

And, until now, no spacecraft has managed to land there.

However, India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft’s Vikram lander touched down on the surface this week in a world first for any space programme — and the historic mission also makes India only the fourth nation to have achieved a controlled landing on the moon.

Now their solar-powered rover will spend two weeks roaming the rocks and boulders and will run a series of experiments to help scientists understand the geology of the moon - and hunt for what could be the moon’s most valuable resource.

And, depending on what it finds, this could be a game-changing moment for space exploration, lunar industry and even establishing possible bases on the moon.

"“How bad it gets is still up to us.”

These are the words Dr Jeremy Wilkinson, a sea ice physicist at the British Antarctic Survey, after new research was published on the catastrophic die-off of emperor penguin chicks in Antarctica.

Thousands of the small animals across four colonies in the region are believed to have died because of record-low sea ice levels that caused a “breeding failure” in late 2022.

Analysis of satellite images showed the break-up of usually stable sea ice and the disappearance of the colonies at a time when chicks had not yet grown their waterproof feathers.

The breeding failures in the Bellingshausen Sea were “without precedent”, the research said, as it was the first time multiple colonies across a large region had all failed in a single season.

About 30% of the known 62 emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica have been affected by partial or total sea ice loss since 2018.

Emperor penguins are unusual in that they have not come under pressure from hunting, fishing or loss of habitat.

Global heating is considered their main long-term threat, with projections that by 2100 about 90% of colonies could be so small that they are essentially extinct.

"Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner paramilitary chief who launched an armed mutiny in June, was on a private jet that crashed in the Tver region near Moscow, killing all 10 onboard, Russian officials have said.

Rosaviatsia, the Russian aviation authority, said Prigozhin was one of the passengers listed in the manifest as being onboard the Embraer business jet that crashed on Wednesday evening.

The cause of the crash was not immediately clear, but Prigozhin’s longstanding feud with the military and the armed uprising he led in June would give the Russian state ample motive for revenge. 

Media channels linked to Wagner quickly suggested that a Russian air defence missile had shot down the plane.

The Embraer jet crashed in the Tver region while flying between Moscow and St Petersburg. 

Video posted to the internet apparently showed the small jet trailing a plume of smoke before slamming into the ground and erupting in flames.

Several Russian news agencies, including Baza, which is close to Russian law enforcement, said the seven passengers and three crew onboard the jet were all killed. Officials later confirmed 10 people had died in the crash.

Prigozhin released a video earlier this week in which he claimed to be in Africa, where his mercenaries have relocated since the abortive uprising. 

But it was unclear when it was taken and if he had returned to Russia since it was shot.

"“Transatlantic chattel slavery is … without parallel for its brutality, without parallel for its length over 400 years, without parallel for its profitability.”

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Patrick Robinson, a leading judge at the international court of justice, has said the UK will no longer be able to ignore the growing calls for reparation for transatlantic slavery.

In April, the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, refused to apologise for Britain’s role in the slave trade or to commit to paying reparations.

“They cannot continue to ignore the greatest atrocity, signifying man’s inhumanity to man,” Robinson said ahead of Unesco’s Day for Remembering the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Abolition.

Robinson, who was born in Sheffield, Jamaica, in 1944, was involved in compiling what has been described as the most comprehensive state-to-state reparations analysis ever conducted.

It concluded that the UK alone is required to pay a sum of $24tn (£18.8tn) as reparations for transatlantic slavery in 14 countries. Of that sum, about $9.6tn is due to Jamaica.

“Reparations have never been paid. So the calculations begin from day one of transatlantic chattel slavery, that is hundreds of years; and that alone explains the high figures”, Robinson when asked if they came as a surprise.

Robinson, who presided over the trial of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević, said the international tide on slavery reparations was quickly shifting and urged the UK to change its position on the issue.

“I see it as a kind of service for the descendants of the enslaved not only in Jamaica and the Caribbean, but wherever transatlantic chattel slavery was carried out.”

"What would you call this young giraffe 🦒 ?

On each of the world’s tallest animals there is a unique pattern of patches, which researchers believe are inherited from their mother … They act as a form of camouflage in the wild and the skin under the spots also has a system of blood vessels that allows them to release heat through the center of each patch - a form of thermal regulation.

Except with this Tennessee newcomer …

The female giraffe, born on 31 July, is a uniform brown color, and is thought to be the world’s only singularly colored and spotless giraffe.
And now Brights zoo have announced a contest for the public to name the almost one-month-old animal, who is already 6ft tall.

The shortlisted options are Kipekee, which means “unique” in Swahili; Firayali, which means unusual; Shakiri, which means “she is most beautiful”; and Jamella, which is “one of great beauty”.

"“You thought it was your right to play God with our lives … We hope you live a very long life and spend every day suffering forever”.

This was what was said in one victim impact statement before Lucy Letby, the country’s most prolific child serial killer in modern history, was told she will spend the rest of her life in prison.

Letby, a neonatal nurse, was sentenced on Monday for murdering seven babies and attempting to kill six more at the Countess of Chester hospital. She is only the third woman in the UK to be given a whole-life term.

“This was a cruel, calculated and cynical campaign of child murder involving the smallest and most vulnerable of children” said the judge, Justice James Goss KC, as he delivered the sentence at Manchester crown court.

Letby refused to return to court to hear her sentence passed, leading to calls to begin legally requiring convicts to face their sentencing hearings in person.

The court, in Letby’s absence, heard heartrending impact statements from the many victims of Letby’s crimes before the sentence was pronounced.

“It was a living nightmare,” said the mother of twin boys, one of whom was murdered and one survived insulin poisoning the following day. “Our world shattered when we encountered evil disguised as a caring nurse.”

“We wanted justice and that day has come.” said the mother of a two-day-old girl who was murdered by Letby.

"“If you look across the world Maui is literally on fire … I don’t know if my ancestral land will still be there if I have children.”

This is what author and climate activist Mikaela Loach said as she staged a walkout of her own book talk alongside two authors at this year’s Edinburgh International Book Festival.

Why? They were protesting the festival’s sponsor’s links to fossil fuel companies, specifically their main sponsor, investment company Baillie Gifford.

The festival has already come under fire for their sponsors, with more than 100 authors sending an open letter this week calling on the event to drop any backers that invest in fossil fuels. Climate activist Greta Thunberg also said that she was cancelling her scheduled appearance at the festival, accusing Baillie Gifford of “greenwashing”.

The Guardian has contacted Baillie Gifford and the festival for comment.

A representative from Baillie Gifford previously said that the firm “has nothing further to add” to the statement that it issued in response to Thunberg’s withdrawal. In that statement, Nick Thomas, a partner at Baillie Gifford, said the company is “not a significant fossil fuel investor”.

The company said in a previous briefing that only 2% of its clients’ money is invested in companies with more than 5% of their revenue coming from fossil fuel activities, compared with the market average of 11%. It also noted that it invested more than double the proportion of clients’ money “in companies dedicated to clean energy solutions”. It also disputes that £5bn has been invested in fossil fuel companies.

In response to the letter last week, the festival’s director, Nick Barley, thanked the authors and asked for time to consider their points. He said they had looked carefully at the firm before using them and concluded that they were investing more in green energy.

"The Killers have apologised after lead singer Brandon Flowers was booed for bringing a Russian fan onstage at a concert in Georgia – the former Soviet state that Russia invaded in 2008 – and urging the crowd to think of each other as “brothers and sisters”.

Towards the end of the concert, held on Tuesday night in Batumi, the band invited a man to play drums with them during the song For Reasons Unknown. “We don’t know the etiquette of this land but this guy’s a Russian,” Flowers can be heard telling the crowd, who responded with a mixture of cheers and boos. “You OK with a Russian coming up here?”

Many people reportedly left the stadium in protest, though according to the user-sourced concert database Setlist.fm, The Killers played through to the end of their show.

“Good people of Georgia, it was never our intention to offend anyone!” the group later wrote in a statement. “We have a longstanding tradition of inviting people to play drums and it seemed from the stage that the initial response from the crowd indicated that they were okay with tonight’s audience participation member.”

The band said that Flowers’ comments onstage “meant to suggest that all of The Killers’ audience and fans are ‘brothers and sisters’”, but that they recognised this meaning “could be misconstrued”.

"“As fires rage in the west, fueled by fossil fuel pollution, today’s ruling in Montana is a game-changer that marks a turning point in this generation’s efforts to save the planet from the devastating effects of human-caused climate chaos”.

This is what Julia Olson, founder of non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust, said on Monday after youth activists won the first constitutional climate trial in US history, in what leading US environmental lawyer Michael Gerrard called ""the strongest decision on climate change ever issued by any court”.

“I’m so speechless right now,” Eva, a plaintiff who was 14 when the suit was filed, said in a statement. “I’m really just excited and elated and thrilled.”

Sixteen young people, aged five to 22, sued the state of Montana earlier this year in the first youth-led climate case to make it to trial, accusing the state government’s pro-fossil fuel policies of contributing to climate change and violating their right to a healthy environment,

“This is a huge win for Montana, for youth, for democracy, and for our climate,” said Olson, whose non-profit law firm Our Children’s Trust brought the suit alongside Western Environmental Law Center and McGarvey Law.

Youth-led constitutional climate lawsuits, brought by Our Children’s Trust, are also pending in four other states. One of those cases, brought by Hawaii youth plaintiffs, is set to go to trial in June 2024, attorneys announced last week.

“The case in Montana is a clear sign that seeking climate justice through the courts is a viable and powerful strategy,” said Delta Merner, lead scientist at the Science Hub for Climate Litigation at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Residents of the Hawaiian island of Maui made desperate escapes from oncoming wildfires, some on foot, as the deadliest US blaze in a century raced toward their homes on Tuesday.

Ella Tacderan, whose family home was in Lahaina, a town in the west of the island that was almost entirely wiped out, describes her experience of the devastation.

As search and rescue crews continue to uncover the scale of the massive and devastating toll in the historic town of Lahaina, anger is building among residents over various aspects of the government response, from warnings during the inferno to aid distribution afterwards. Residents have asked why emergency sirens didn’t warn Lahaina residents in time to evacuate.

The Green party’s spokesperson on migration and refugees, Benali Hamdache, told LBC radio the decision was an “expensive way to be cruel”, as the first 15 asylum seekers were moved on to the Bibby Stockholm barge.

Lawyers say they are intervening to halt the transfer of dozens more onto the floating accommodation, claiming the vessel is unsafe and unsuitable for traumatised people.

The Bibby Stockholm’s use comes as the Home Office fulfilled Rishi Sunak’s promise to use barges and former military bases to accommodate some asylum seekers after the cost of housing them in hotels rose to £1.9bn last year.

However, the move has been condemned by refugee organisations as costly, cruel and inhumane.

An asylum seeker who was jailed in Iran for his human rights campaigning told the Guardian he has not been able to sleep since receiving a notice that he is being moved to the Bibby Stockholm barge and said it would be another “jail” for him.

Sarah Dines, the minister for safeguarding, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that while only a small number of asylum seekers were expected to be housed on the barge, which has 222 cabins, at first, it could increase rapidly to its capacity.

Pressed on whether all of them could be onboard by the end of the week, Dines said: “Yes, quite possibly it will be 500. We are hoping.”

She said the increase in the number of people on the ship would be gradual, despite concerns from the Fire Brigades Union that the vessel was “a deathtrap”.

"“In Brazil, there are at least glimmers of hope,” writes our global environment editor Jonathan Watts.

In June, the government celebrated a 34% fall in Amazon deforestation rates since Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was elected president at the start of the year. Now the figures for July are on course to be even better, the environment minister, Marina Silva, has told the Guardian, there has been decrease of more than 60% compared with the same month last year.

The exact figure, which is based on the Deter satellite alert system, will be released in the coming days. But independent analysts described the preliminary data as “incredible” and said the improvement compared with the same month last year could be the best since 2005.

The rapid progress highlights the importance of political change. A year ago, under the far-right then president, Jair Bolsonaro, the Amazon was suffering one of the worst cutting and burning seasons in recent history.

Bolsonaro has been accused of “annihilating environmental policy”, which has had a severe impact on Brazil’s indigenous population like the Yanomami people.

Since a new administration led by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took power at the start of the year, the government has penalised land grabbers, mounted paramilitary operations to drive out illegal miners, demarcated more indigenous land and created more conservation areas.

However, as Watts explains: “Brazil’s agribusiness-dominated Congress has undermined the chances of future gains by gutting the authority of the environment ministry, and the lower house passed a bill to limit recognition of Indigenous lands. These contradictory signals are not conducive to growth – ecological or economic.”

"Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to federal charges over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, marking the third time this year that he has been forced to respond to a criminal indictment.

Trump was arrested and arraigned on four felony counts outlined in special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights.

The arraignment came two days after Smith’s office filed its indictment, accusing Trump of executing a “criminal scheme” to remain in office even after it became clear that he had fairly lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden.

"They started as flood victims, now they are touted as local heroes for cleaning up the rivers and beaches of Indonesia’s third largest city Bandung in West Java, amassing over 9 million followers on TikTok and Instagram in the process and influencing others across the country to join the fight against pollution.

The Pandawara group was formed in 2022 by five men in their early twenties after flooding caused by rivers clogged with rubbish damaged their homes. They take their name from the five Pandava princes of Indian folklore and the word wara, which translates to the five bearers of good news.

On TikTok, their profile – @pandawaragroup – contains over 100 short videos of their river and beach clean ups, earning them millions of views and totalling over 100 million likes.

“We have a team of river hunters who identifies rivers with urgent trash issues, where flooding can happen after rainfall,” Pandawara member Gilang Rahma told the Guardian.

The Greater Bandung area where they live produces 2,000 tons of waste each day, 10 to 20% of which doesn’t make it to landfill and often ends up in rivers.

Pandawara’s latest call saw 600 people, including local government staff and officials, join the clean up of 17 tons of waste from the Bugel dam in Bandung regency, which is connected to West Java’s longest river.

"Unlike Donald Trump’s first two indictments, the former president’s third set of criminal charges stands out as the first major legal effort to hold him accountable for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.

It is the first time a US president has faced charges over an alleged effort to deny the American people their democratic right to choose their own leader.

Prosecutors said that for two months after his election loss, Trump spread lies to create an “intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger” and “erode public faith in the administration of the election”.

They cited an example in Georgia, where Trump claimed more than 10,000 dead people voted in four days even after the state’s top elections official told him that was not true.

Trump is bidding to regain the White House in 2024 and currently leads in polling for the Republican presidential nomination by a substantial majority. He called the case “ridiculous”.

"Federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, the latest criminal case before the former president that comes just weeks after he was charged with retaining national defense information.

Trump was charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, one count of conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.

The indictment lists six co-conspirators who played a central role in his efforts to overturn the election. While unnamed in the document, the details in the indictment show that those people include Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, and Jeff Clark, a former Department of Justice employee.

The 45-page indictment, handed up by a federal grand jury in Washington DC on Tuesday, bluntly recounts how Trump and his allies activities after the 2020 election. In stark detail, it lays out how Trump knowingly spread false allegations about fraud, convened false slates of electors, and attempted to block the certification of the election on January 6.

"Niger, which was considered a stable country in an unstable region, has been grappling with the fallout of a military coup that has been widely condemned by the international community.

Last Wednesday, the west African country’s presidential guard, a group that is supposed to protect the democratically elected leader, blockaded the presidential palace. Soldiers appeared on state TV to announce they had removed President Mohamed Bazoum from power, seized control of the government and suspended the constitution.

Bazoum’s election in 2021 was the first democratic transition of power in a country that has witnessed four military coups since independence from France in 1960.

Anti-coup and counter protests erupted in the normally peaceful capital, Niamey, but the military acted quickly and violently to quell dissent. A nationwide curfew was announced and the borders were closed.

France has said it will begin evacuating its citizens and other Europeans from the country. Tensions between Niger and its former colonial power have escalated since the coup. Bazoum was one of the last pro-western leaders in Africa’s Sahel region, which has faced jihadist insurgencies.

These latest developments have been a bitter blow for western countries, particularly France and the US, who for a decade have viewed Niger as a reliable partner because of the relative stability it held in a region marred by terrorism, violence and coups.

The situation is further complicated by Niger’s geopolitical importance to the west and Russia’s looming presence in the surrounding region.

"Two people have reportedly been killed by severe flooding that has engulfed parts of Beijing after Typhoon Doksuri struck the Chinese capital, transforming roads into rivers and trapping hundreds in their homes.

Parts of northern China, including Beijing, have been hit by severe flooding caused by the typhoon – the strongest storm to hit the country in years – which brought with it record rainfall.

Doksuri made landfall on Friday, downing power lines and uprooting trees, affecting about 880,000 people in coastal Fujian and forcing more than 354,400 to evacuate, state media reported.

Before hitting China, the typhoon roared through Taiwan and the northern Philippines, where rain and strong winds led to the capsizing of a ferry that left at least 25 people dead.

While Doksuri continued to taper off, forecasters warned that Typhoon Khanun was approaching and was set to strike China’s densely populated coast this week.

"“However good Healy’s intentions were, his apparent white saviour complex and performative activism mirror the post-colonial guilt that many white westerners seem to have when visiting countries once ruled by the British empire.”

Queer artist bones tan jones has criticised the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy for kissing his male bandmate on stage at Good Vibes festival in Malaysia.

Authorities cancelled the remainder of the three-day festival, with many people fearing a festival of this size won’t be allowed in the country for a while.

“Queer people in Malaysia can’t kiss someone of the same sex without risking being fined or flogged, so why can Matty Healy?” says jones.

The musicians and workers involved in the festival are now preparing a lawsuit against Matty Healy and the 1975 to seek damages from the cancellation.

And @yaya.bones believes that Matty Healy’s actions has made the situation worse for the Malaysian LGBTQ+ community rather than better.

In Malaysia, there are no LGBTQ+ rights, with a penalty of up to 20 years in prison for sodomy and Global Trans Rights Index ranks Malaysia as the second worst country in the world for transgender rights.

jones says they wish Healy had donated to the grassroots organisations that fight for LGBTQ+ rights in Malaysia, like Justice for Sisters who raise awareness about violence and persecution towards Mak Nyah (transgender women) in Malaysia.

“To Healy and his fans: if you want to actually help LGBTQ+ people in Malaysia, please consider funding the aforementioned organisations.”

"“The air is unbreathable, the heat is unbearable, and the level of fossil fuel profits and climate inaction is unacceptable. Leaders must lead. No more hesitancy, no more excuses, no more waiting for others to move first. There is simply no more time for that.""

These are the words of the UN secretary general, António Guterres, after scientists confirmed July was on track to be the world’s hottest month on record.

“Humanity is in the hot seat,” Guterres told a press conference on Thursday. “For vast parts of North America, Asia, Africa and Europe, it is a cruel summer. For the entire planet, it is a disaster. And for scientists, it is unequivocal – humans are to blame.""

“All this is entirely consistent with predictions and repeated warnings. The only surprise is the speed of the change. Climate change is here, it is terrifying, and it is just the beginning. The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.”

The steady rise in global average temperatures, driven by pollution that traps sunlight and acts like a greenhouse around the Earth, has made weather extremes worse.

Guterres urged politicians to take swift action adding that: “It is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C and avoid the very worst of climate change but only with dramatic, immediate climate action. We have seen some progress – a robust rollout of renewables and some positive steps from sectors such as shipping – but none of this is going far enough or fast enough. Accelerating temperatures demand accelerated action.”

"""It is just so heartbreaking that so many [whales] have beached themselves,"" says local volunteer Kaysanne Knucke, as rescuers try to save a pod of long-finned pilot whales after a mass beaching in Western Australia.

Drone footage showed the moment the pod of almost 100 whales moved tightly together before becoming stranding at Cheynes beach about 60km (37 miles) east of Albany on Tuesday evening.

Knunckey, along with other volunteers, were waist-deep in the ocean from 7.30am until after 11am, pulling the live mammals back into the water and supporting them with the help of a sling. 'It was freezing and hard to stand still just holding the whales,"" she says. ""The atmosphere was fairly positive and everyone is just trying to think of the bright side.""

Researchers from across Australia are baffled by the never-before-seen behaviour of the whales, who were grouped together in a heart shape in the hours leading up to the beaching.

""The fact they were in one area very huddled and doing really interesting behaviours and looking around at times suggests something else is going on that we just don’t know,"" says Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a wildlife scientist at Macquarie University.

Analysing the clip, Pirotta says a whale may have been sick or the pod may have become disorientated – but it was unlikely they were trying to avoid predators.

Dr Olaf Meynecke, a whale researcher at Griffith University, says of all whales, dolphins and porpoises, pilot whales are most prone to mass strandings because of their strong emotional ties.

""They are so closely bonded it’s almost like they are stressing each other out … It kind of makes sense given their strong emotional bonding to their peers,"" he says.

But Esme Wheeler, the RSPCA’s dog welfare expert, is very concerned about the activity because it is an “overwhelmingly negative experience for the dogs”.

“To strip a puppy of their choice and control at a formative stage of their development creates a basis for future problems, which are common reasons for animals to be given to rehoming centres,” she says.

As a number of climate records – some unofficial – tumble in recent weeks, with sea surface temperatures reaching new heights, and Antarctic sea ice new lows, the climate crisis is moving into uncharted territory.

The world is shifting towards a superheated climate not seen in the past 1m years – prior to human existence – because “we are damned fools” for not acting upon warnings over the climate crisis, according to James Hansen, the US scientist who alerted the world to the greenhouse effect in the 1980s.

"The Women’s World Cup kicked off today … but it’s already looking a little bit different as some very important players are missing.

Why? Injuries and – more specifically – an ACL injury epidemic.

A few hours before the Australian’s team’s opening match against Republic of Ireland, Sam Kerr – the Matildas’ star striker – pulled out with a calf injury.

Kerr is set to return after two games but this is not the case for many big names who have suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries.

It’s a real challenge for players due to the particularly long recovery time, which means it’s not only career-changing but also why we’ve seen so many tweaks to World Cup squads.

The reigning champions, the USA, are without a host of key players, while England are missing their Euro 2022 Golden Boot-winning forward Beth Mead, captain Leah Williamson and Fran Kirby.

While ACL injuries are not preventable, there is consensus that more needs to be done to improve research around the multifaceted causes and to find ways to reduce the risks associated with them.

Female athletes are far more susceptible to cruciate damage and Dr Katrine Okholm Kryger, a medical researcher who specialises in women’s football, says it ‘relates back to inequality between men’s and women’s football’.

"Speaking publicly for the first time after his rescue, an Australian sailor who was found adrift in the Pacific Ocean after three months has said he is grateful to be alive.

Timothy Lyndsay Shaddock, 54, set sail in April from the Mexican coastal city of La Paz bound for French Polynesia about 6,000 km away, but became stranded after a rough storm damaged his catamaran and knocked out the communications equipment.

He was accompanied by a dog, Bella, who “sort of found me in the middle of Mexico … I tried to find a home for her maybe three times and she just kept following me into the water,” Shaddock said.

“She’s a beautiful animal and I’m just grateful she’s alive.”

They survived the ordeal by eating raw fish and drinking rain water until they were found by a Mexican fishing ship.

"""Their pledges were deployed for cynical political purposes"".

It was likely the Earth’s hottest week in history earlier this month, according to preliminary data, and top scientists agree that the planet will get even hotter unless we phase out fossil fuels.

Yet leading energy companies are intent on pushing the world in the opposite direction, expanding fossil fuel production and insisting that there is no alternative.

It is evidence that they are motivated not by record warming, but by record profits, experts say.

Amid record-shattering warmth this February, BP scaled back an earlier goal of lowering its emissions by 35% by 2030, saying it will aim for a 20 to 30% cut instead.

ExxonMobil quietly withdrew funding for a heavily publicized effort to use algae to create low-carbon fuel. And Shell announced that it would not increase its investments in renewable energy this year, despite earlier promises to dramatically slash its emissions.

“They have left no doubt that their pledges were deployed for cynical political purposes, only to be ditched when they no longer suited the industry’s strategic position,” said Dan Cohn, a global energy transition researcher at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Red weather alerts have been issued across Europe, while China recorded its hottest day ever – a record temperature of 52.5C in the north-west of the country – over the weekend, and California’s Death Valley, among the hottest places on Earth, reached a near-record 52C on Sunday.

“We are in uncharted territory and that is worrying news for the planet,” said Prof Christopher Hewitt, the director of climate services at the World Meteorological Organization.

The heatwaves that have battered the world recently show that “climate change is out of control”, said UN secretary general, António Guterres, as he warned that if the world delayed key measures needed to limit fossil fuel emissions, it would move “into a catastrophic situation”.

"“This shouldn’t be a hard decision for the government: just give us what we are owed so we can go back to work.""

This is why A&E doctor Joanna Sutton-Klein said when she joined strike action earlier this year.

This week, junior doctors began another strike, but this time it is a five-day walkout in England that began on Thursday. It is being called the longest walkout of its kind in NHS history – and comes amid continuing an increasingly bitter row over pay, morale and safe staffing levels.

But, for Joanna, what was the turning point to join the picket line – and what would she like to see change for doctors?

"“What’s happening to us is happening across all fields of labor, when employers make Wall Street and greed their priority and they forget about the essential contributors that make the machine run,” said Fran Drescher as Hollywood’s actors formally announced a strike.

The Nanny star turned union president has blasted Hollywood studios in a fiery speech after talks between the actors’ union and studios failed to avert a strike, calling them “disgusting” for claiming “they’re losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their CEOs”.

After negotiations between studio representatives the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) and the US actors’ union Sag-Aftra (Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) failed to make a breakthrough, Hollywood actors are going on strike. The actors Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt walked out of the Oppenheimer premiere to join the strike.

The decision means that actors will be joining writers on the picket lines, marking the first time in more than six decades that both unions have taken simultaneous strike action and expanding the standoff between Hollywood workers and studio executives over wages, AI technology and how to divide the profits of the new digital streaming era.

On Saturday the tabloid claimed “a well-known presenter” gave a 20-year-old crack cocaine user “more than £35,000 since they were 17 in return for sordid images”.

The most powerful of the newspaper’s allegations was that the young person was under 18 when they allegedly began selling pictures to the BBC presenter - raising the possibility that a serious criminal offence may have been committed.

"Disastrous floods have hit countries around the world this summer, including China, India, Japan and the US, after torrential rain in July that has left communities facing the loss of their homes, loved ones and livelihoods.

With scenes emerging of miles of devastation, these extreme weather events are triggering warnings of the climate crisis intensifying.

“It’s not surprising to see these events happening”, said Brian Soden, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Miami. “As the climate gets warmer we expect intense rain events to become more common,”

Atmospheric scientists in the US have warned that while these flooding disasters may be thousands of miles apart, they all have one thing in common. As the global average temperature increases – with the world’s temperature records broken on two days in a row this month, while global sea surface temperatures were at record highs for the time of the year in May and June, according to WMO –  storms are forming in a warmer atmosphere, making extreme rainfall a reality right now.

A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which results in storms dumping more precipitation that can have deadly outcomes. And the additional global heating that scientists predict is coming will only make it worse.

"‘I need justice’ says a survivor of the migrant shipwreck in Greece. 

They have been working with Forensis, a research agency founded by Forensic Architecture, who - along with the Guardian and media partners - have been investigating the incident on 14 June, which left an estimated 500 people missing and presumed dead. 

They have found that attempts by the Greek coastguard to tow a fishing trawler carrying hundreds of migrants may have caused the vessel to sink.

The coastguard has strenuously denied that it attempted to tow the trawler and has said it “would not comment on operational issues or the ongoing investigation which is confidential according to a Supreme Court Order.”

The joint investigation by the Guardian, German public broadcaster ARD/NDR/Funk and Greek investigative outlet Solomon, in collaboration with Forensis, has given one of the fullest accounts to date of the trawler’s course up to its sinking - read their full findings by clicking the link in bio.",2023-07-11 19:26:02
"“The public have the right to know what role money plays in our politics.”

This is what Steve Goodrich, the head of research and investigations at Transparency International UK said about the Guardian’s recent investigation into shares held ‘in secret’ by several dozen MPs or their close family members.

The shareholdings identified by our reporter, Henry Dyer, are all within companies that could be affected by legislation or new policy introduced by parliament.

The companies include, for example, the likes of oil and gas company BP; our investigation found that six MPs or their close family members have shares that in total are worth nearly a combined £120,000.

Almost all of the holdings found are not strictly required to be publicly declared under parliamentary transparency rules requiring the disclosure of a shareholding in any single company worth more than £70,000 or more than 15% of the company’s stock. In comparison, members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have to declare within 45 days any trade in stocks over $1,000.

This means an MP could trade £69,999.99 in shares in a single company and not strictly be required to disclose the financial dealing. They could hold stakes of this level in several companies operating in the same sector and still not be strictly required to declare the holdings.

The difficulty in uncovering who owns shares in publicly listed companies in this country “renders them in effect secret” — which is “very concerning”, says Susan Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption.

“If an MP has shares in a company affected by legislation going through parliament, there’s invariably a tension between them protecting their financial affairs and advancing the public good”, says Goodrich.

“Understanding who has skin in what game is essential to unpicking policy inertia, be it on housing, climate change or the cost of living.”

"“Why didn’t they save the people first? If they don’t want illegal migrants, let them deport us, but don’t let us drown.”

These were the words of Ahmed Farouq, who lost his son in the Pylos shipwreck last month, which left more than 500 people missing and presumed dead in one of the Mediterranean’s worst boat disasters.

Now according to a new investigation by the Guardian and media partners, attempts by the Greek coastguard to tow the fishing trawler may have caused the vessel to sink.

The overcrowded vessel carrying migrants from Libya to Italy sank off the coast of Greece on 14 June. There were 104 survivors.

Reporters and researchers conducted more than 20 interviews with survivors and drew on court documents and coastguard sources to build a picture of missed rescue opportunities and offers of assistance that were ignored.

Multiple survivors said that attempts by the Greek coastguard to tow the vessel had ultimately caused the sinking. Allegations have also been made that survivors’ statements were tampered with.

The coastguard has strenuously denied that it attempted to tow the trawler and has said it “would not comment on operational issues or the ongoing investigation which is confidential according to a Supreme Court Order.”

"Have you downloaded the much-talked about Threads app yet?

When Meta’s new Twitter-rival launched on Wednesday, a battle between two billionaires began.

The move from Mark Zuckerberg is a bold attempt to lure users away from its floundering competitor with a near-clone of the platform.

Elon Musk has responded by threatening to sue Meta, and saying Twitter had “serious concerns that Meta Platforms (Meta) has engaged in systematic, willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter’s trade secrets and other intellectual property”.

“Competition is fine, cheating is not,” he later tweeted.

Our media editior Jim Waterson tested it out and said: “After a day using Threads, one thing is pretty clear: it is not Twitter …”

“Instead, Threads has the potential to be something different and powerful: Twitter with fewer rough edges, more corporate sheen, and enough potential to suck the remaining life – and advertising revenue – out of Musk’s struggling network.”

Zuckerberg told a user on the app that: “The goal is to keep it friendly as it expands … That’s one reason why Twitter never succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently.”

But many say it’s early days yet and Threads are reminiscent of what Twitter once was.

Others are also keen to point out the potential issues of an even greater dominance of Meta on social media – it already owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, to which Threads is linked – and about the huge amount of personal data the app freely acknowledges it is collecting about users.

"This year’s Women’s World Cup promises to be the most anticipated in history - but with less than a month to go there have already been a number of issues off the pitch that the women’s teams have come up against.

@guardian_sport ‘s Suzanne Wrack explains that the tournament has *already* been making headlines before it kicks off in Australia and New Zealand on 20 July.

“There are already a lot of issues off the field that are going to be hugely influential on this tournament, there have been big disputes behind the scenes and very publicly,” Wrack says.

Wrack explains that these issues impact the ability of women’s teams to perform at, or even take part in, the tournament.

She says: “These disputes undermine the ability of teams and they speak to the wider commitment of Federation’s to their women’s teams and women’s football in general.”

"At least five Palestinians were killed and dozens injured after Israel launched its biggest military operation in the occupied West Bank in years.

Israeli forces raided the city of Jenin on Sunday night in a major aerial and ground offensive, triggering a gun battle that lasted into the morning.

The Israeli military says its forces targeted a building that served as a command centre for fighters from the Jenin Brigades, a unit made up of different militant groups based in the city's largest refugee camp.

The operation led to protests overnight across the West Bank, including at a checkpoint near the city of Ramallah, in which a Palestinian man died after being shot in the head by the army.

The escalating violence in the West Bank over the past 15 months has caused mounting international alarm.

“Military bulldozers have destroyed roads leading to the refugee camp, which is impeding ambulances from reaching patients. All roads leading to the camp are blocked, including for ambulances,” humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières said in a statement.

The conflict comes as the UK government is due to debate a bill on Monday that would impose fines on public bodies, including local councils, that seek to impose boycotts against Israel.

"Which of these doppelgängers do you think look the most alike?

Photographed by @francoisbrunelle.doubles, these lookalikes are not related, but look strikingly like each other.

But why are they so captivating and also confusing to look at?

“It’s the differences that destabilise you – the same but different variations of nostril and ear, which cause that familiar psychic wobble,” writes the Observer’s Eva Wiseman. You really feel it when looking at the work of the Canadian artist.

He was inspired to find and photograph more than 200 pairs of unrelated doppelgängers after being regularly told he looked like Rowan Atkinson … you can swipe to the last slide to see if you agree!

The picture series, I’m Not a Look-alike!, which took 12 years to put together, features men and women who stare out of the frame in the same way.

When the project went viral, it was brought to the attention of Dr Manel Esteller, a researcher at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, who recruited 32 pairs of Brunelle’s look-alikes to take DNA tests and complete questionnaires about their lives. What was the explanation for these doppelgängers, he wondered? What were we seeing? He found that the 16 pairs who were “true” lookalikes, according to facial-recognition software, shared significantly more genes than the others that the software deemed less similar.

“Now there are so many people in the world,” Dr Esteller explained to the New York Times, “the system is repeating itself.”

“Not only are apps that can find our doppelgängers multiplying, the population is multiplying, too, at a pace which means we are all more likely to have one. I just… don’t want to meet her,” writes Wiseman.

"Onsite drug testing facilities at music festivals “encourage people to not play Russian roulette with their lives”, argues journalist Daisy Jones, who says it helps some festival-goers make “safe, informed choices”.

With hundreds of thousands of people descending on events this summer, the Home Office has been accused by leading festival organisers, artists and MPs of endangering the lives of festival-goers after effectively blocking on-site drug testing this month by requiring festivals to apply for a special licence.

Volunteer-run drug-testing facilities such as The Loop operate from festivals to provide a safe space for advice, test drugs to check for substances that may put people at a greater level of risk and put out warnings if dangerous substances are found.

Blocking these organisations from festival sites is risky, and just another example of the UK government’s “puritanical” approach to drug safety which isn’t prioritising the facts, says Jones.

"A French police officer is being investigated for homicide over the fatal shooting a 17-year-old boy in the Paris suburb of Nanterre after he failed to comply with an order to stop his car.

A video shared on social media shows two police officers beside the car, one of whom shoots as the driver pulls away.

Sporadic clashes broke out between youths and police on Tuesday evening as anger over the death of the teenager grew in the local community.

“As a mother from Nanterre, I have a feeling of insecurity for our children,” said Mornia Labssi, a local resident and anti-racism campaigner, who said she had spoken to the victim’s family, which she said was of Algerian origin.

After a record 13 deaths from police shootings in France during traffic stops last year, this was the second fatal incident in such circumstances in 2023.

Three people were killed by police gunfire after refusing to comply with a traffic stop in 2021 and two in 2020. A Reuters tally of fatal shootings in 2021 and 2022 shows the majority of victims were black or Arabic origin.

"“Something has to change.”

This is what Chloe Partridge, a 22-year-old from Arizona – a state which passed a law last year banning abortions after 15 weeks – said to the Guardian US’s Poppy Noor.

Chloe was forced to carry her pregnancy to term after the supreme court voted to overturn Roe v Wade, despite having been told her baby had an unsurvivable medical condition. She watched her baby die in distress after two days.

“To have to go full-term and watch her die slowly over two days was so horrible. I was forced to do that,” says Chloe. “Nobody should be able to choose what I do with my body.”

The US supreme court ruled one year ago that abortion is not protected under the constitution, which means states now have the power to regulate the procedure as they see fit.

Twelve months on, the reality for many is grim.

Since the ruling, the legal landscape of the US has changed, creating a patchwork of vastly unequal access to reproductive care.

Abortion bans invalidated by Roe v Wade in some states were resurrected. Elsewhere, “trigger laws”, designed to ban abortion if federal protections were overturned, went into effect. In other states, new bans were passed.

Now, a year after the Dobbs decision, abortion is banned in 14 states and severely restricted in five others, affecting the lives of more than 27 million women.

“With the politicians we have now, I don’t see anything changing. But this is bullshit,” says Chloe.

However, Chloe believes there are small reasons for hope. “People are becoming more aware” of situations like hers, she says, “and realise this is a disgusting way to treat women”.

"“I was used as a political pawn”

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has spoken about her experience being incarcerated in Iran at a talk at Glastonbury on Friday afternoon.

“The Iranian government would sacrifice their own citizens to feed their own agenda, to the point that they don’t even care about a young mother and her young child,” she said. “I was used as a political pawn for something that predated me. The debt the British government owed the Iranian government was before I was even born.”

After spending six years in jail in Iran, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe last year returned home to her family in Britain; she was accused of spying by Iranian authorities, an accusation she denied.

During the talk, she spoke about how seeing a supportive banner at the festival four years ago gave her hope:

“While I was in prison I had very little access to the outside world. So I don’t actually know what was happening, I knew there was a campaign going on, but I didn’t exactly know the details or what was happening.”

She added: “But my parents did take one copy of a very low quality picture smuggled into Evin which was a banner from Glastonbury 2019, we’re all going to cry now, that showed Free Nazanin ... that shows how far your story can get if people care about you.”

Today, a packed crowd at the Left Field tent on Worthy Farm stood and applauded Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe for around 40 seconds after a speech she made in the middle of a debate by an all-female panel to discuss the rights of women in Iran.

"To mark the one year anniversary of the Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, the case that overturned Roe v Wade, the @guardian_us has created a visual directory of state legislators who embraced the opportunity to restrict abortion access. 

These are the faces of lawmakers and governors whose votes helped pass bans on abortion at conception or after six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant. 

Out of the 1,572 politicians, 1,347 are men, compared to 225 women. 

Overall Republicans make up 96% of the anti-abortion group. Of the remaining 4%, there are 53 men and 11 women from the Democratic party, and two Independents.

After Ukraine’s Nova Kakhovka dam was destroyed on 6 June and thousands of people were evacuated from the city of Kherson, hundreds of pets and farm animals were left stranded in the flood water that inundated the area.

Volunteers from the Kyiv Animal Rescue Group – founded in 2014 with the aim of rescuing animals during emergencies – navigated inundated towns, Russian shells and dangerous conditions to travel to the region and save the animals.

"""It's wonderful to see how this one historical event has influenced us two, three generations on”, says Kamau Johnston, grandchild of an Empire Windrush passenger from Jamaica.

Kamau is one of four grandchildren of the Windrush generation who spoke to the Guardian about how the arrival of almost 500 people from the Caribbean to the UK, 75 years ago changed the country for the better and why it should be celebrated.

In 1948, from Kingston, Jamaica to Tilsbury Docks, the ship brought over 492 West Indian passengers – a postwar generation that helped rebuild the UK and paved the way for others to follow.

Five years ago, the Windrush scandal revealed how decades after arriving in Britain, Caribbean-born UK residents have been wrongly detained, deported and denied legal rights. “When the whole world was against them, the did this amazing thing despite of that,” said Kellie Brothwood, whose grandfather was Trinidadian, “and that's the reason why we're here today”.

Kamau and Kellie were joined by Bianca Judd whose Trinidadian grandfather served in the British airforce, and Dane Gardner whose grandad was a passenger on Empire the Windrush from Jamaica. This is why they want their families to be remembered.

"Is Ozempic really a miracle drug, or the latest sign of how unwell our society’s relationship to size and weight is?

In a new personal essay, Rachel Pick looks at the rise of Ozempic and how quickly it has erased the modest gains of the body positivity movement (which was by no means perfect itself).

“When you go to such absurd lengths just to winnow yourself down a little, you are actively trying to put as much distance between yourself and fat people as you possibly can,” Pick writes. “It tells us that a part of you is disgusted by us, that a part of you has contempt for the way we are and the way we look.”

"“When a mass drowning such as this one hits the headlines, governments squirm as their own culpability is probed,” says journalist Diane Taylor, who writes on human rights, racism and civil liberties.

About 80 people are confirmed to have died, and up to 500 people are still missing, including many children, after a crowded fishing vessel sank off the coast of Greece last week in one of the Mediterranean’s deadliest boat disasters in recent years.

Nine suspected people smugglers appeared in court this week accused of piloting the vessel. But, Taylor argues, “no matter that kingpins of smuggling operations generally don’t pilot overloaded leaky boats across dangerous expanses of water … government’s should look to their policies and rhetoric, instead of diverting blame, in order to stop the deaths”.

“While many smugglers may be greedy and ruthless, they are responding to human demand … the decision to escape is made first and the smuggler is sought second,” she adds in her latest Guardian opinion article.

About 27,000 people have died or disappeared while trying to cross the Mediterranean since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration (IoM).

Greek authorities have also been criticised for their failure to act more quickly to stop this disaster, and have rejected claims that the boat capsized after the coastguard attempted to tow it. This disaster also comes nearly a month after the EU called for an independent inquiry into video footage, brought to light by the New York Times, that purports to show the “illegal” deportation of refugees out of the country's border.

"“We’re living a nightmare”

This was Leshie Chandrapala’s reaction to watching a newly released video appearing to show a Christmas party at Conservative party headquarters during coronavirus restrictions. Her father, Ranjith Chandrapala, 64, was a bus driver on the Ealing hospital route from the beginning of the coronavirus crisis; he died in May 2020. 

Leshie says she felt a “physical sickness” the first time she saw the footage. She is one of hundreds of members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK who have expressed their anger and frustration over the video.

The footage, which was obtained by the Mirror newspaper, appears to show members of staff drinking alcohol and dancing on 14 December 2020 at a gathering held by the campaign team of the unsuccessful London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey, who has since been given a peerage in Johnson’s resignation honours list. At least 24 people were reportedly in attendance. On the day the party reportedly took place, then health secretary Matt Hancock announced that London would enter tier 3 restrictions in order to contain a surging number of Covid infections. 232 people lost their lives to the pandemic that day.

The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, apologised for the video, describing the actions of those involved as “terrible” and “indefensible”, but said it would not be right for him to say whether the Metropolitan police should reopen it investigation into the lockdown-breaking event. 

A photograph of the party formed part of a Met police investigation last year. Police found insufficient evidence of law breaking and no fines were issued, as the force said the “photo by itself is not sufficient evidence on which to assess that an offence had been committed”.

The force has said it is “assessing video footage that was not previously provided to officers when investigating an event in Matthew Parker Street on 14 December 2020”.

These are the words of 27-year-old forest defender Daman Matis. He helps to police a riverside government protection base in the Amazon on one of the waterways that illegal gold miners use to invade protected Indigenous lands.

One year after the killings of Bruno Pereira, a renowned defender of the rights of Brazil’s Indigenous peoples and Dom Phillips, a British journalist and longtime Guardian contributor, the battle to protect the world’s greatest rainforest is intensifying.

Activists are defiant in the face of the many dangers of confronting the environmental criminals and organised crime groups who have tightened their grip on the Amazon region and are increasingly threatening the Indigenous peoples who have lived there since long before European explorers arrived in the 16th century.

"“Abortion is healthcare, it is a fundamental right for women to have control over their own bodies and over their own lives” says lawyer Charlotte Proudman. 
This week, a 44-year-old woman was sentenced to more than two years in prison for procuring drugs to induce an abortion after the legal limit. 
She was convicted under Offences against the Person Act, an “archaic” Victorian law which dates back to a time before women had the vote. 
Under this 162-year-old legislation, the decision to terminate an unplanned pregnancy using pills in the privacy of a home is punishable by prison and the maximum sentence is life imprisonment.

The news has been met with “real horror from people” says @drproudman, who has found that “most people thought that abortion was decriminalised [in the UK]”. 
The woman believed she was 28 weeks pregnant, but doctors later concluded the foetus was from 32 to 34 weeks’ gestation at the time of termination.

In England, Scotland and Wales abortion is partially decriminalised up to 24 weeks, so long as strict conditions were in place, such as a confirmation from two medical practitioners that the pregnancy had not exceeded 24 weeks, or that the termination was necessary to prevent injury or mental harm. Any abortion outside these criteria is still a criminal offence. 
“We can’t access reproductive healthcare without giving reasons and meeting stringent legal conditions,” says Dr Proudman. 
The recent sentencing has led to calls from campaigners for legal reform, and concern from health experts that the sentencing could open the door to more prosecutions. 
The number of women and girls facing police investigations and the threat of life imprisonment under current abortion laws has risen over the past three years, according to BPAS. In 2022, a woman who used abortion medication in a failed attempt to end her own pregnancy was reported to the police by her medical team. 
Watch to find out why Dr Proudman thinks abortion should be fully decriminalised.

"Scientists have created synthetic human embryos using stem cells, in a groundbreaking advance that sidesteps the need for eggs or sperm.

Scientists say these model embryos, which resemble those in the earliest stages of human development, could provide a crucial window on the impact of genetic disorders and the biological causes of recurrent miscarriage.

However, the work also raises serious ethical and legal issues as the lab-grown entities fall outside current legislation in most countries.

The structures do not have a beating heart or the beginnings of a brain, but include cells that would typically go on to form the placenta, yolk sac and the embryo itself.

The development highlights how rapidly the science in this field has outpaced the law, and scientists iare already moving to draw up voluntary guidelines to govern work on synthetic embryos.

“If the whole intention is that these models are very much like normal embryos, then in a way they should be treated the same,” Robin Lovell-Badge, the head of stem cell biology and developmental genetics at the Francis Crick Institute in London said. “Currently in legislation they’re not. People are worried about this.”

"Tens of thousands of dead fish washed up on the Gulf coast of Texas over the weekend, covering the shoreline with rotting carcasses and leading local officials to warn visitors to keep away.

Low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water made it difficult for the fish to breathe, Texas parks and wildlife department officials said. The phenomenon – known as a “fish kill” – is common as temperatures rise in the summer, the state department said.

While no one has connected this specific incident to climate change, researchers have said such kills may become more prevalent as temperatures warm and oxygen levels in lakes across the United States and Europe drop.

Dissolved oxygen levels increase with photosynthesis, the process by which plants transform sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into oxygen. When there is less sunlight, photosynthesis slows and at night it stops. But plants and animals in the water continue to consume oxygen at the same rate, decreasing the concentration, Texas parks and wildlife officials said.

Gulf menhaden, which fishers commonly use for bait, was the species most affected in the kill, parks and wildlife officials said.

Katie St Clair, the manager of the sea life facility Texas A&M University at Galveston, told NPR that gulf menhaden is a popular snack for sea animals, and “with this die-off of fish, there is a huge nutrient pulse into our environment”.

“It’s kind of a circle of life,” she added.

"Campaigners and MPs have reacted with outrage to a woman being sentenced to more than two years in prison for procuring drugs to induce an abortion after the legal limit.

The mother of three received the medication under the “pills by post” scheme, which was introduced during the Covid pandemic for unwanted pregnancies up to 10 weeks, after a remote consultation.

Prosecutors said the woman had knowingly misled the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) by saying she was below the 10-week cut-off, when she believed she was about 28 weeks pregnant.

Doctors later concluded the foetus was from 32 to 34 weeks’ gestation (between seven and eight months) at the time of termination. In England, Scotland and Wales, abortion is generally legal up to 24 weeks but is carried out in a hospital or clinic after 10 weeks.

The woman, 44, pleaded guilty in March under the Offences against the Person Act, legislation that dates back to 1861, and will serve half of her 28-month sentence in custody and the remaining under licence. Originally, she had pleaded not guilty to a charge of an offence of child destruction.

The judge in the case said the woman felt “very deep and genuine remorse” and was racked with guilt and plagued by nightmares over her actions.

The judge said there were no sentencing guidelines for the offence, but that the maximum sentence was life imprisonment.

Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality party, said: “This conviction serves no one, not her, not her children, not the public interest. All it does is punish a woman for seeking healthcare in the middle of a pandemic and risk deterring women who want or need an abortion from seeking that care in future. No one deserves to be criminalised for seeking healthcare, which is a human right.”

"For Manchester City, it was the crowning glory, the trophy that they have craved to complete the ultimate set. It is often said that clubs must suffer before they win the Champions League and how City have done so, especially during the Pep Guardiola years when domestic dominance has brought no guarantees in Europe’s elite and most capricious competition.

They suffered some more here, Internazionale pushing them all the way, much further than many had expected. The team that finished third in Serie A were the equal of City for much of a high-stress night here in Istanbul.

There was a moment just before the hour when Guardiola sank to his knees as Lautaro Martínez rushed up the left only to shoot too close to Ederson. It was a long way from being the kind of crushing City performance that Premier League supporters have grown used to.

It was only about the result and City found a way to it through the force of their personality. It had become increasingly clear that one moment could be all that either side needed and City made it happen when Manuel Akanji played in Bernardo Silva up the right and when his pull-back deflected, there was Rodri, running on to the loose ball to send a low shot fizzing home.

"Boris Johnson is standing down immediately as a Conservative MP after an investigation into the Partygate scandal found he misled parliament and recommended a lengthy suspension from the House of Commons.

The former prime minister angrily accused the investigation of trying to drive him out, and claimed there was a “witch-hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result”.

In a bitter 1,000-word statement, he attacked Rishi Sunak’s government, blaming the current prime minister for rising taxes, not being Conservative enough and failing to make the most of Brexit.

Johnson added: “It is very sad to be leaving parliament – at least for now – but above all I am bewildered and appalled that I can be forced out, anti-democratically, by a committee chaired and managed, by [the Labour MP] Harriet Harman, with such egregious bias”.

The resignation will trigger an immediate byelection in Johnson’s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency. It was the second in a day for Sunak after Nadine Dorries resigned as MP for Mid Bedfordshire after her inclusion on Johnson’s peerage list was blocked. Labour sources view both the seats as potentially winnable.

Johnson’s dramatic move came on the day Sunak cleared a resignation honours list for him, including more than 40 peerages and other rewards, for some of his closest allies from the time of the Partygate scandal.

"Federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump with violating the Espionage Act and conspiring to obstruct the criminal investigation among other counts, according to a person familiar with the matter, a historic development marking the most significant legal peril yet for the former president.

The exact nature of the seven-count indictment, filed by the office of special counsel Jack Smith in federal district court in Miami, remains unclear. At least some of the counts include willful retention of national security materials, obstruction, scheme to conceal, false statements and conspiracy, the person said.

Trump and his legal team were told of the charges on Thursday afternoon. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm, the person said, confirming what the former president posted on his Truth Social platform.

For more than a year, prosecutors have examined whether Trump knowingly retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after he left office and took steps to conceal the materials after the justice department issued a subpoena for their return.

Criminal charges against Trump in the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation means the former president is now a defendant in a second case after he was indicted on state charges in New York by the Manhattan district attorney over his role in hush-money payments to an adult film star in 2016.

The indictment by the special counsel Jack Smith, appointed by the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, to lead the documents investigation, also means the country must grapple with the unprecedented situation of a twice-impeached, twice-charged former president running for re-election.

"This timelapse reveals the extent of the almost apocalyptic fog blanketing New York City, turning the skyline orange-brown and driving residents off the streets.

Tens of millions of Americans are currently under air quality alerts as smoke from wildfires spreading through Canada drift southward across east coast states. Multiple states across the east coast including New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut have issued air quality alerts.

In New York City, residents were advised to limit their time outdoors, as public schools cancelled outdoor activities. The PM2.5 concentration — tiny particulate matter which is one of the most harmful air pollutant particles — in New York City is currently 20.7 times the WHO annual air quality guidelines, according to IQAir.

Smoke from wildfires in Canada has been moving south into the US since May. Hundreds of fires are burning in Canada, from the western provinces to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east, where there are more than 150 active fires in a particularly fierce start to the summer season.

With New York City being ranking this morning as the city with the world’s worst air pollution, surpassing cities like Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, mayor Eric Adams warned that climate change has accelerated the conditions surrounding the smokey haze that has shrouded the city.

"Prince Harry appeared to fight back tears as he finished giving evidence in the phone-hacking trial at the high court, saying there was “hard evidence” that he had been illegally targeted by Mirror Group Newspapers.

The prince spent eight hours in the witness box across two days, breaking with protocol as he became the first royal to be cross-examined in a court since 1891. He told the court that British newspapers had illegally targeted him all his life and then gone to “extreme lengths to cover their tracks”.

Asked how he felt as he finished giving evidence, the prince replied quietly: “It’s a lot.” Harry said he had decided to accuse the Mirror, Sunday Mirror and People of hacking and illegal information-gathering after being disgusted by the way tabloids reported on his wife, Meghan.

The Mirror accepts its reporters hacked the phones of many celebrities in the 2000s but says it did not use these tactics on Harry.
Andrew Green KC, the Mirror’s barrister, previously told the court that Harry had indulged in “total speculation” about how news articles were obtained. He told Harry there was no evidence his phone had been hacked by journalists working for Mirror Group Newspapers: “There is not a single item of call data, at any time, to your mobile phone.”

This angered Harry, who appealed directly to the judge: “My lord, my whole life the press have misled me, covered up their wrongdoing. To be sitting here in court knowing that the defence has the evidence in front of them, and Mr Green saying I’m speculating … I’m not entirely sure what to say about that.”

"Before you read on … can you guess what percentage of sea ice melting in the Arctic is the result of human-caused global heating? 🧊

It’s 90%, with natural factors accounting for the rest, according to new research that has found it is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice.

The scientists who carried out the study are warning preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result.

Analysis shows that even if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced, the Arctic will be ice-free in September in coming decades. The study also shows that if emissions decline slowly or continue to rise, the first ice-free summer could be in the 2030s, a decade earlier than previous projections.

“As scientists, we’ve been warning about the loss of Arctic summer sea ice for decades. This is now the first major component of the Earth system that we are going to lose because of global warming. People didn’t listen to our warnings,” said Prof Dirk Notz, of the University of Hamburg, Germany, who was part of the research team.

Since satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has shrunk by 13% a decade, in one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis. Arctic sea ice reaches its annual minimum at the end of summer, in September, and in 2021 it was at its second lowest extent on record.

In the early hours on Tuesday, footage began to emerge on social media, showing most of the Nova Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River washed away and a massive surge of water heading downstream. The Ukrainian government has accused “Russian occupation troops” of blowing up the dam.

The dam lies about 20 miles (30km) east of the city of Kherson, which Ukrainian forces recaptured in late 2022. Its reservoir holds an estimated 18 cubic km of water – about the same volume as the Great Salt Lake in Utah – and supplies cooling water to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant. Destroying the dam would add to Ukraine’s ongoing energy problems, after Russia spent weeks earlier this year targeting vital infrastructure.

Occupying Russian authorities in the town of Nova Kakhovka initially denied anything had happened to the dam, then blamed the collapse on Ukrainian shelling, with the local Russian-installed mayor calling it a “terrorist act”.

"‘This was a disaster’

A groundbreaking analysis reveals how police in Portland, Oregon, blanketed the city with toxic chemicals during a 2020 protest against the murder of George Floyd, raising concerns about global teargas use.

Forensic Architecture (FA), a research agency that investigates human rights violations, created a 3D simulation of the Portland police bureau’s extraordinary use of teargas during the protest on 2 June 2020.

FA worked with weapons experts to analyze hundreds of videos from that evening, along with internal police files, invoice records, manufacturer data and photos of teargas canisters.

The analysis reveals that the city’s downtown was blanketed with gas at more than 50 times the level federal regulators consider “immediately dangerous to life or health”.

The research renews pressure on the scandal-ridden police department and raises significant public health and civil rights concerns at a time when law enforcement agencies in the US and across the globe are escalating their use of teargas on crowds, including against protesters for abortion rights and police accountability.

Protesters in at least 100 US cities were met with teargas attacks in 2020, and in the three years since, law enforcement agencies have continued to deploy the chemical munition against crowds.

“I hope at some point we as a society can see there isn’t a need for this type of policing that allows for this violence to happen to people, and that we dismantle it,” Teressa Raiford, executive director of Don’t Shoot, said.

“There was a lot of emotional, physical and mental trauma from that summer,” said Dr Brianna da Silva Bhatia, a Portland-based health strategist with Physicians for Human Rights. “This was a disaster that fractured the community, and accountability would be law enforcement owning that.”

"At least 120 people have been killed and about 850 injured after two passenger trains collided in the eastern Indian state of Odisha.

The Coromandel Express, which runs from Kolkata to Chennai, collided with another passenger train, the Howrah Superfast Express, railway officials said on Friday.

The Howrah Superfast Express derailed and became entangled with the Coromandel Express, South Eastern Railway authorities said in a statement.

“We have more than 120 deaths per the last count and the number is increasing as there are a lot of serious injuries, head injuries,” Sudhanshu Sarangi, director general of the Odisha Fire Services, told reporters at the accident site. “A very sad incident and the prognosis is not good”.

One survivor told local television news that he had been sleeping when the accident happened and woke to find himself trapped under about a dozen passengers before crawling out from the carriage with only injuries to his neck and arm.

Images from the scene showed rescuers climbing up the mangled wreck of one of the trains to find survivors.

Hundreds of young people lined up outside a government hospital in the city of Soro in Odisha to donate blood.

"“I wanted to make trans people feel loved, supported and safe. That’s all I was trying to do,” says Riz Possnett after protesting the gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock’s talk at the University of Oxford.

This week footage of the trans activist glueing themself to the debating chamber close to the speaker’s chair was shared across social media.

The demonstration temporarily halted Stock’s speech, as the police removed the activist - but Possnett says they didn’t want to stop the talk, only ‘disrupt it’.

“I respect Kathleen’s right to free speech, but I’m also painfully aware of the consequences her speeches have on trans people in the UK,” says Possnett.

Stock, who argues that transgender people cannot expect all the rights afforded by biological sex, had been speaking over the sound of up to 200 people protesting outside about her invitation when a group of activists stormed the debating chamber on Tuesday. During the event, Stock insisted she was not anti-trans despite what her critics said.

According to Possnett, many students didn’t want Stock speaking at their university - with the student union and elected committee voting to condemn the Union’s invitation of the academic.

Students had organised a trans pride to take place on campus to protest Stock’s speech and celebrate trans lives but Possnett felt like they needed to do something more.

"In an accidental moment of bipartisanship, a Republican senator has said something Democrats have been saying about his party all along.

During a Senate hearing on Wednesday, Oklahoma’s Markwayne Mullin dismissed the idea of ‘reality’ during an exchange on childcare and the teaching of race.

While questioning the witness Cheryl Morman, a childcare expert, Mullin shot back at her call for realism, saying: “I don’t want reality.”

The remark prompted laughter in the hearing room.

Mullin is an election denier, former cage fighter and plumbing company owner, who sat in the US House before being elected to the Senate last year.

His confrontational style has made headlines before. In March, for example, he told a Teamsters leader to “shut your mouth” during a fiery exchange.

After dismissing the concept of reality in this latest hearing, Mullin said he “misspoke” and returned to questioning his witness.

"“If Indigenous communities are not supported and able to protect their rainforests, all of us will suffer”

One year ago, Bruno Pereira, a renowned defender of the rights of Brazil’s Indigenous peoples and Dom Phillips, a British journalist and longtime Guardian contributor, were killed on the frontline of the battle to protect the planet.

They were ambushed on the Amazon’s Itaquaí River while returning from a reporting trip to the remote Javari valley region.

The attack prompted international outcry, and cast a spotlight on the growing threat to the Amazon posed by extractive industries, both legal and illegal, such as logging, poaching, mining and cattle ranching, which continue to make billions off the rainforest’s raw materials - with disastrous consequences.

Today, we launch the Bruno and Dom project, a year-long collaborative investigation coordinated by Forbidden Stories that involves more than 50 journalists from 16 media organisations in 10 countries around the world.

The goal is to honour and pursue their work, to foreground the importance of the Amazon and its people, and to suggest possible ways to save the Amazon. In this video, the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, looks at their lives and legacies.

"Human activity has pushed the world into the danger zone in seven out of eight new indicators of planetary safety and justice, according to a groundbreaking analysis of the Earth’s wellbeing.

Going beyond climate disruption, the report by the Earth Commission group of scientists presents disturbing evidence that our planet faces growing crises of water availability, nutrient loading, ecosystem maintenance and aerosol pollution.

These pose threats to the stability of life-support systems and worsen social equality.

The study is the most ambitious attempt yet to combine vital signs of planetary health with indicators of human welfare. It sets out a series of “safe and just” benchmarks for the planet that can be compared to the vital signs for the human body.

Instead of pulse, temperature and blood pressure, the eight indicators it looks at are climate, functional integrity, natural ecosystem area, water flow, groundwater, nitrogen, phosphorus and aerosols.

The authors say the planetary diagnosis is grim but not yet beyond hope, though the time for a remedy is running out.

Joyeeta Gupta, the Earth Commission co-chair, said: “Our doctor would say the Earth is really quite sick right now in many areas. And this is affecting the people living on Earth. We must not just address symptoms, but also the causes.”

"'It’s taught me more about what I enjoy’

More and more people are choosing to go without sex. And, in many cases, they’ve never been happier.

Take Caitlin. She didn’t set out to become celibate – at least not in the beginning. Three years ago, she was coming out of an abusive relationship and wasn’t ready to meet someone else.

“I thought during that time I needed space to heal and reflect on what I’d been through,” she says.

Caitlin’s celibacy, three years in now, became intentional. “It’s taught me more about what I enjoy in sex, which I wasn’t expecting. I thought it was going to put me at a disadvantage, but I feel a lot more confident in my own sexuality,” she says.

Voluntary, or intentional, celibacy has become increasingly popular. In January, it was reported that there was a 90% increase in Google searches for celibacy that month.

However, this isn’t a short-term fad, says Dr Justin Lehmiller, a Kinsey Institute research fellow and host of the Sex and Psychology podcast. “Humans are increasingly less sexually active, with some forgoing sex altogether.”

There is evidence that humans were brewing their own booze even before the wheel caught on, but how much do we know about how it works on our brains and bodies?

Well, quite a bit. Recent decades have seen dozens of studies validate some old sayings, debunk others, and give the medical establishment a much clearer understanding of how alcohol affects us and how much it is really OK to drink.

"In 2015, Tom Turcich left his hometown in New Jersey with one destination: the world.

Pushed to consider the meaning of life after his close friend’s death when he was 17 and inspired by the film Dead Poets Society, Turcich started to make plans for his travels. He would endlessly study maps, working out the best routes. Much of it depended on practicalities such as which countries insisted on a visa.

At his sendoff, his father couldn’t have been more excited. “I was like, hey, go for it! Aw gee, just be careful, have a good time!” he says. “But his mother cried for months when he left.”

Eleven months of the first year was spent walking and sleeping out – typically behind churches and in woods. He came across tarantulas and snakes, particularly on the palm plantations where he slept in Costa Rica.

Turcich says he met so many wonderful people along the way. He was already an optimist when he set off, but by the time he returned he had even more faith in humankind, if less in some of the systems we live under.

“The first two years were about me and the mind. After that, it became much more about the world. I started to understand it more. I became more interested in what influences people and why countries are the way they are,” Turcich said.

Turcich walked 21-24 miles a day for roughly half of the seven years he was away. In total, he walked 28,000 miles and his dog Savannah 25,000 miles. He is the 10th person to have walked the world, and he assumes Savannah is the first dog to have done so.

"When Mohammad Hashemi woke up this time last week, he was told that his cousin Majid Kazemi had been executed - along with Saleh Mirhashemi and Saeed Yaqoubi. The Iranian regime had claimed three men were responsible for the deaths of three members of the security forces during anti-government protests in November.

Immediately after their execution, state media reran video posts of what were presented as the mens’ confessions, which Amnesty International said had been extracted by torture.
Speaking to the Guardian from Sydney, @mohammad_hashemii said his cousin was tormented by interrogators.

Kazemi was also allegedly subjected to mock executions at least 15 times and reportedly shown a video of one of his brothers being tortured.

In an audio message recorded inside Dastgerd prison, Kazemi said: ‘I swear to God I am innocent. I didn’t have any weapons on me. [Security forces] kept beating me and ordering me to say this weapon is mine … I told them I would say whatever they wanted, just please leave my family alone.’

"Tina Turner has died at the age of 83 after a long illness.

The pioneering rock’n’roll star, who became a pop behemoth in the 1980s, affirmed and amplified Black women’s formative stake in rock’n’roll. She defined that era of music to the extent that Mick Jagger admitted to taking inspiration from her high-kicking, energetic live performances for his stage persona.

After two decades of working with her abusive husband, Ike Turner, she struck out alone and – after a few false starts – became one of the defining pop icons of the 1980s with the album Private Dancer.

Turner had suffered ill health in recent years, being diagnosed with intestinal cancer in 2016 and having a kidney transplant in 2017.

In a statement, a representative said: “Tina Turner, the ‘Queen of Rock’n Roll’ has died peacefully today at the age of 83 after a long illness in her home in Kusnacht near Zurich, Switzerland. With her, the world loses a music legend and a role model.”

“Turner’s musical character has always been a charged combination of mystery as well as light, melancholy mixed with a ferocious vitality that often flirted with danger,” scholar Daphne A Brooks wrote for the Guardian in 2018.

For many years she was an aid worker, caught in events that were worth being angry about: the civil war in Syria, the 2014 Gaza war, Hurricane Matthew in Haiti. “In those contexts, it was weird if you weren’t furious, or an alcoholic, or maybe both,” she writes.

But it wasn’t until after the pandemic, and one particularly bad blow-up, that she decided to enroll in a 10-week anger management course.

She thought it might help – after all, such sessions have been seen as the definitive solution for anger issues for decades now.

But Olivia didn’t find the easy cure she was looking for. While she found the basic techniques of the course and the support system it offered to be helpful, it also neglected the root causes of some anger.

“In the one-dimensional world of anger management, it turns out, there is no big picture, and there is no room for broader questions about the society we all live in – or, to put it another way, 'reality',” she writes.

"“From the word go within clinical placement, I always felt very heavily sexualised by patients,” she said. “One time, when I had to get close up to a patient’s face to examine his eyes, the patient started licking his lips and rubbing himself. I was 19 or 20 at the time and the consultant had left the room – I was completely terrified.”

This is the experience of Katie (not her real name), a junior doctor in the south-east of England. She said she did not feel she could tell anyone as she found most of the consultants intimidating.

Katie is one of thousands of hospital staff who are reporting claims of sexual assaults and harassment by patients, an investigation has found, prompting calls for ministers to address the “daily threat of abuse” faced by doctors and nurses.

More than 20,000 alleged incidents of sexual violence and sexual misconduct by patients on hospital staff were recorded in the five years to 2022 by 212 NHS trusts in England, freedom of information (FoI) requests by the Guardian and the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found.

The 20,928 cases accounted for just under 60% of the total alleged incidents trusts disclosed. Allegations included claims of rape, sexual assault, harassment, stalking and sexualised remarks.

Experts cautioned that the figures were likely to be a serious underestimate as staff are often deterred from making complaints when patients abuse them.

Deeba Syed, a senior legal officer at the Rights of Women helpline, said: “Women tell us they are expected to continue to care for patients who are abusive or harassing without efforts to adequately safeguard them from further harassment.

“We hear worrying reports of women feeling pressured into not raising formal grievances and instead being transferred to different departments or locations. They tell us it is argued that this is more expedient than moving the harassing patient, despite victims feeling this is unsafe to others and a punishment on them.”

"“Cover someone else's story, follow someone else” says presenter and journalist Chanté Joseph responding to the BBC’s latest Panorama episode: ‘Private ADHD Clinics Exposed.'

In the film that came out last Monday night, the documentary aimed to show people that patients are being offered powerful drugs and are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after unreliable online assessments.

After watching the episode, however, a number of people who have ADHD criticised the piece, including @chantayyjayy. She said: “The main problem with the documentary is that it makes ADHD diagnosis look very trivial and easy and accessible” - and for her that wasn’t the case.

In the video we talk to Chanté and Dr. Samantha Hiew (@adhd_girls), about the need for better intersectional representation of the ADHD community and why it’s much easier for white men to get diagnosed.

A BBC spokesperson said: “Panorama made clear that ADHD is a recognised condition affecting many adults and highlighted the long waits for assessment and treatment on the NHS in some areas.

“This was an investigation into the way some private clinics diagnose and prescribe ADHD medication following assessments conducted over online video calls.

“We recognise the profound impact the condition can have on people’s lives and have taken great care to ensure the programme doesn’t stigmatise people who have ADHD. We encourage people to watch the documentary.”

"“If only the scientists who'd warned the world decades ago had been listened to. But no, that wouldn't have won votes or made the rich richer. My heart is broken.”

This is what one of our readers wrote in response to this cartoon by the Guardian’s Steve Bell.

He created this piece after scientists issued a warning that our overheating world is now 66% likely to breach the 1.5 C climate threshold in the next five years.

Hitting this point would break the key temperature limit that countries pledged to under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

Experts say this could have dire consequences and might unleash a cascade of increasingly catastrophic and potentially irreversible impacts according to research from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).

New record temperatures have been set in many areas around the world in the heatwaves of the past year, but those highs may only be the beginning, according to the report, as climate breakdown and the impact of a developing El Niño weather system combine to create heatwaves across the globe.

El Niño is part of an oscillating weather system that develops in the Pacific. For the past three years, the world has been in the opposing phase, known as La Niña, which has had a dampening effect on temperature increases around the world.

If the world passes the limit, scientists stress the breach, while worrying, will likely be temporary.

In response to this report, António Guterres, the secretary general of the UN tweeted: “The climate crisis can feel overwhelming. But I urge you to remember one vital fact: limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees is still possible. We have all the tools we need to get the job done. Let’s accelerate #ClimateAction - now.”

"Saltier than seawater? 🍕

New research has revealed that half the pizzas eaten in Britain contain all of the salt that government scientists say we should be eating in a day.

Nutritional analysis of 1,387 different pizzas bought in shops, supermarkets, takeaways and restaurants shows that one of the Domino’s range has more than three days’ worth of salt in it.

The brand’s sizzler standard mozzarella stuffed crust medium pizza emerged as the UK’s saltiest pizza in the research. It contains 21.4 grams of salt, which makes it saltier than seawater. In contrast, the maximum daily intake, as recommended by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), is just six grams.

Action on Salt found that Zizzi, Franco Manca and Crosta & Mollica are the retailers and manufacturers with the saltiest pizzas per 100g, while Domino’s, Papa John’s and Caprinos are the worst offenders in the restaurant and takeaway sector.

However, it also identified the brands with the smallest amounts of salt per 100g. Goodfella’s, Morrisons and the Co-op are the retailers and manufacturers whose pizzas contain the lowest amounts of salt, with Bella Italia, Pizza Express and Fireaway among the restaurant and takeaway operators offering the least salty pizzas.

Health experts said the high levels of salt in one of the country’s favourite foods is worrying because it leads to high blood pressure, which is the leading cause of heart attacks and strokes.

A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson said: “Thanks to our salt reduction programme, the amount of salt in food has fallen by about 20% – helping to prevent nearly 70,000 heart attacks and strokes while reducing pressure on the NHS.

We will continue to work closely with industry to make it easier for people to make healthier choices.”

"“The bill doesn’t allow for queer survival whatsoever,” says DeLovie Kwagala.

The queer photographer and activist from Uganda, says they felt force to flee to South Africa as their home country began implementing the hardline anti-LGBTQ+ bill known as the ‘kill the gays’ bill.

Despite four amendments, the bill retains most of the harshest measures of the legislation adopted in March. Those include the death penalty for certain same-sex acts and a 20-year sentence for “promoting” homosexuality, which activists say could criminalise any advocacy for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer citizens.

President Yoweri Museveni, a vocal opponent of LGBTQ+ rights, applauded lawmakers for having “rejected the pressure from the imperialists”. Museveni now has until the end of the month to either sign the legislation into law, return it to parliament for another revision, or veto it and inform the parliamentary speaker. The bill will, however, pass into law without the president’s assent if he returns it to parliament for a second time.

While in South Africa, Kwagala – who is non-binary – was notified by the Ugandan authorities that they would be arrested on their return due to their work photographing queer people, and fundraising to support Uganda’s LGTBQ+ community through their charity @hashtagwhatnext. “Because fundraising and visible activism are seen as aiding the promotion of homosexuality,” @aconstantbecoming told the Guardian.

Their South African study visa expires on 24 May, and they cannot change their conditions from within the country, meaning they are forced to return to Uganda.

"“There is no humane way to kill a whale at sea. This new evidence underscores how outdated this practice is. It has to end immediately – no one in Iceland is dependent on this meat,” said Patrick Ramage, senior director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 

A new report by the Icelandic food and veterinary authority has revealed that whales have taken as long as two hours to die during hunts in Iceland.

Here, Guardian reporter Karen Mcveigh, talks about the findings, and a distressing video of one killing which caused public uproar. We have chosen only to show a short excerpt of the graphic footage.

Danny Groves, a spokesperson for Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: “We’ve known for a long time that time to death in these hunts can take 20-25 minutes. It will be an agonising death because these are sentient beings. They will experience great pain.

“You’re using a grenade-tipped harpoon from a moving ship to a moving target. This wouldn’t be allowed in a slaughterhouse in the UK.”

"‘My life has stood still.'

Until last year, Robin Kyle Reeves lived an active life in Laurel Hill, Florida. But after undergoing laser eye surgery at the recommendation of a doctor, she finds it impossible to stare at screens for an extended period of time and can no longer work or enjoy her hobbies.

“It was supposed to be zip, zap, and within a couple of weeks you’re healed and life goes on,” Reeves said. “But my life has stood still since July 12 of last year.”

Robin’s experience is supposed to be rare. The American Refractive Surgery Council says the procedure’s complication rate is less than 1%. But patient advocates and some experts say that is not the full picture, and that the true complication rate is much higher.

One such expert is Dr Morris Waxler, a retired FDA adviser who voted to approve Lasik in the 1990s. He is now one of its biggest critics, and says he regrets his decision.

"“We actually opened the doors for lots of people … Ah, we had so much fun!”

This is what Reggie Mcgoon – or Nana Reggie – remembers when she first started expressing her identity as a trans woman freely after taking inspiration from the celebration of a third gender in traditional Fijian culture.

The iTaukei term “vakasalewalewa” refers to people assigned male at birth but who have a feminine gender expression and whose identity as both is celebrated – something that changed after Britain colonised Fiji in 1874.

Mcgoon remembers at school she was told off by teachers for always playing with the girls and there was no discussion of alternative gender identities.

“People wouldn’t talk about it because it was a big taboo, because it’s instilled into young people’s minds because this is a Christian country, and we shouldn’t talk about these things.”

“Vakasalewalewa is a term that we are continuously reclaiming unapologetically in recognition of our rich history, traditions and our right to exist,” says Sulique Waqa, founder of Haus of Khameleon, a Fiji-based movement advocating for transgender equality in the Pacific.

"Presented with her Bafta lifetime achievement award – the TV industry’s ‘highest accolade’ – Meera Syal dedicated her win “to all my fellow travellers, all the ones who’ve been made to feel because of their race, sex or class that their stories don’t matter. They do because the untold stories are the ones that change us, and sometimes can change the world.”

Syal, who is best known for starring in Goodness Gracious Me and as one of the first British Asian people to regularly star on TV in the UK, added that the TV industry needs more diversity, “not just in front of the camera but in the writers’ rooms, in makeup vans and around tables where deals are done”.

Putting a glittering bindi on her face-shaped Bafta award last night, Syal, 61, recalled how growing up as a “chubby brown kid from Wolverhampton I got othered a lot”, and how her father had studied philosophy and dreamed of being a singer and a poet, yet encountered the attitude: “Never mind bloody Plato, can you drive a bus or not?” on his arrival in the UK.

Bafta chair Krish Majumdar described Syal as a “national treasure”, whose role in Goodness Gracious Me – shown on BBC Two from 1998 to 2001 – had “changed the game”.

"After 18 rounds of chemotherapy, Samuel Castleberry (pictured above on slide one) says he is tired.

If it were up to him, he’d still be working his trucking job. The 59-year-old was making a decent living and felt fit. But in June 2020, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which has already spread to his liver. Now he gets out of breath wheeling his garbage can to the curb at his home in Alabama.

Thirteen years ago, he helped clean up BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill just off the coast of Louisiana, the largest ever in US waters – and he was not alone.

More than 33,000 others rushed toward the toxic oil to save the place they loved, joining forces to clean up our coastlines.

According to the Alaska toxicologist Riki Ott, the valor they displayed was comparable to the heroism of first responders during the 9/11 terror attacks, who ran to the World Trade Center to save people and breathed in toxic dust and fumes.

“What resident and professional oil spill responders do is exactly what professional firefighters and emergency responders everywhere do: put their lives on the line to protect ours,” she says.

However, since the clean-up, thousands of Deep Horizon’s first responders have become chronically, and in some cases fatally, sick.

They have experienced chronic respiratory issues, rashes and diarrhea – a problem known among local residents as “BP syndrome” or “Gulf coast syndrome”. Many have also developed debilitating long-term illnesses including cancer.

Yet, despite recently posting $5bn in quarterly profit, BP has denied compensation to thousands of workers suffering from long-term health damages.

“It’s by far the most gut-wrenching public health disaster that I’ve ever been exposed to. What’s particularly frustrating is BP doesn’t care,” said Tom Devine, the legal director for the Government Accountability Project.

The Guardian interviewed dozens of those former clean-up workers – many had never spoken publicly before.

BP declined to comment on a series of detailed questions from the Guardian, citing the ongoing litigation.

"“We left everything behind,” says Alejandro Rangel González who was trying to cross into the US after 11pm local time last night. Why 11pm?

That’s when the US lifted a coronavirus-related immigration restriction called Title 42.
It’s an arcane public health law that has allowed the US to quickly expel migrants at the US-Mexico border since 2020, which it said was aimed at protecting Americans from disease.

Since the start of the pandemic, the right to claim asylum in the US has been blocked for many fleeing political and economic crises, especially from Central and South American countries, the Caribbean and parts of Africa.

"For 21 years, Abu Zubaydah has been in US custody without charge, tortured and sexually humiliated, with no prospect for release.

Zubaydah, 52, was captured in Pakistan in March 2002, taken to several CIA dark sites, and transferred to Guantánamo in 2006, where he has been held ever since. He was the first victim of what was to become the widespread use of torture by the US against terror suspects.

“The drawings are a powerful depiction of what happened to him, and are remarkable given that he has not been able to communicate directly with the outside world,” Zubaydah’s international legal representative, Helen Duffy, said.

Videotapes of Zubaydah being tortured were filmed by the CIA but then destroyed in violation of a court order, while a 6,700-page torture report by the Senate intelligence committee remains secret almost a decade after it was completed.

Though the full Senate report has never been made public, its conclusion is known: that the abuse of Zubaydah and other detainees failed to elicit any new intelligence. In other words, torture does not work.

"“We promised each other that we would never leave one another's side except if death separates us. Death did.""

This is what 19-year-old Mohammad Saed said about the death of his fiancee Dania Adas, also 19, in the recent airstrikes on Gaza. Moments before the strike hit, they had been discussing how they would pose together for their engagement photo, Saed said.

Israel and Palestinian militant groups in the blockaded Gaza Strip have continued fighting despite reports of ceasefire negotiations, in a bloody episode of violence that has left 28 people in Gaza dead and one person in Israel dead.

Palestinian militant groups launched a volley of rockets into Israel on Wednesday, bringing daily life in Tel Aviv to a standstill, after Israel carried out airstrikes targeting the leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza on Tuesday.

Tensions have been running high since Khader Adnan, a prominent political figure affiliated with Islamic Jihad, died on hunger strike in Israeli custody.

Among the victims of the strike on Tuesday Dania Adas and her 16-year-old sister Iman Adas. The sisters were both killed when Israeli jets hit the building next door where an alleged senior Islamic Jihad leader, Khalil Aal-Bahtini, lived with his wife and daughter, all of whom were also killed.

Israeli officials said Bahtini was one of three senior leaders from Islamic Jihad targeted in the strikes, accusing him of being the commander responsible for a barrage of rocket attacks on Israel last week.

Tensions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have soared over the past year: more than 100 Palestinians and at least 19 Israelis and foreigners have been killed in 2023 so far across Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, leading to worries that a return to full-scale conflict is on the horizon.

"Police in Pakistan have arrested hundreds of supporters of the ousted prime minister Imran Khan who protested after his arrest on corruption charges, authorities said on Wednesday.

Khan was presented before a judge at a police station in Islamabad, 24 hours after his arrest by scores of paramilitary officers that led to uproar across the country.

Supporters of the former prime minister protested across Pakistan, demanding his release.The government said supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party had attacked important state buildings and damaged private and public vehicles.

According to police, nearly 1,000 of Khan’s supporters were arrested in Punjab province, Pakistan’s most populous state, after 25 police vehicles and more than 14 government buildings were set on fire.

In the city of Peshawar, at least three people were shot dead and 27 were injured after violence broke out between protesters and police, according to a local hospital. Vehicles were torched and the building of Radio Pakistan was set alight. In Islamabad, a police officer was set on fire.

"The first UK baby created with DNA from three people has been born after doctors performed a groundbreaking IVF procedure that aims to prevent children from inheriting incurable diseases, the Guardian's science editor, Ian Sample, has revealed in his exclusive.

The technique, known as mitochondrial donation treatment (MDT), uses tissue from the eggs of healthy female donors to create IVF embryos that are free from harmful mutations their mothers carry — as people inherit all their mitochondria from their mother — and are likely to pass on to their children.

Because the embryos combine sperm and egg from the biological parents with tiny battery-like structures called mitochondria from the donor’s egg, the resulting baby has DNA from the mother and father as usual, plus a small amount of genetic material – about 37 genes – from the donor.

The process has led to the phrase “three-parent babies”, though more than 99.8% of the DNA in the babies comes from the mother and father.

The UK is not the first country to use the MDT technique. In 2016, a US doctor announced the world’s first MDT birth after treating a Jordanian woman who carried mitochondrial mutations that cause a fatal condition called Leigh syndrome.

Progress with MDT led parliament to change the law in 2015 to permit the procedure. Two years later, Newcastle Fertility Centre became the first and only national centre licensed to perform it, with the first cases approved in 2018. Approval is given on a case-by-case basis by the UK’s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which has given the green light for at least 30 cases.

"“Mind-boggling” and “infuriating” - this is how experts have described the methane leaks, a potent greenhouse gas, from Turkmenistan’s major fossil fuel fields.

However, these leaks can be easily fixed, experts say, in a move that would rapidly reduce global heating.

The western fossil fuel field in the oil- and gas-rich country of Turkmenistan leaked 2.6m tonnes of methane in 2022, while the eastern field emitted 1.8m tonnes, according to data produced by Kayrros for the Guardian.

Together, the two fields released emissions equivalent to 366m tonnes of CO2, more than the UK’s annual emissions, which are the 17th-biggest in the world.

Methane emissions have surged alarmingly since 2007. This acceleration may be the biggest threat to keeping below 1.5C of global heating and also seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, according to scientists.

However, tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions, and therefore global heating. 

The Guardian recently revealed that Turkmenistan was the worst in the world for methane “super emitting” leaks. While little is known about fossil fuel production under Turkmenistan’s repressive dictatorship, and speaking freely about the authoritarian state is difficult, sources adding that it is a “very depressing” situation.

"After more than seven decades in waiting, King Charles III has been crowned in Westminster Abbey by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. The St Edward’s Crown was placed on the King’s head after a small struggle. It’s the only time Charles will wear it in his life.

In the lavish and archaic ritual not seen in Britain since 1953, the king was anointed with holy oil and swore the oath of kings, before his wife, Queen Camilla, was then presented with the royal sceptre and the rod of equity and mercy, and also enthroned.

This was the reaction from the Liberty Human Rights group after the head of the UK’s leading republican movement and other organisers of an anti-monarchist protest at the coronation were arrested on King Charles III’s procession route.

Scotland Yard later said “several” arrests had been made for breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause public disorder, adding that lock-on devices used by protesters to attach themselves to street furniture had been found. The allegation was denied by Republic.

"‘That’s Marla’ 

Video of Donald Trump’s deposition in his civil rape trial in New York City was released to the public on Friday.

The footage, from last October, included a previously reported but never publicly seen exchange in which the former president mistook a picture of his accuser, the writer E Jean Carroll, for a picture of his second wife, Marla Maples.

“That’s Marla, yeah,” Trump said. “That’s my wife.”

Carroll says Trump raped her in a department store in New York in the mid-1990s. She is suing for battery and for defamation, over comments he made while denying the claim.

Citing Philip Murphy, a former director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, who called it 'an irrelevant institution wallowing in imperial amnesia', Mohammed writes: “Its legacy of colonialism and now neocolonialism has undermined its legitimacy and relevance.”

And with Caribbean countries such as Barbados and Jamaica beginning to break away from the UK, Mohammed asks: “Would a better alternative be for the Caribbean to join Africa and Asia in an economic union, or – controversially – the Bric nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa)?”

"Are you sitting comfortably? Well, get up! And why not try standing on one leg too?

It’s well known that balance diminishes with age and that falling is a real danger for older people. But falls are the third most common cause of unintentional injury worldwide for ages 18 to 35, too.

To begin with, try standing on one leg for 20 seconds, then switch sides. If you can master that, try it standing inches from a blank white wall. A wall with no visual cues makes it harder. Then try it with your eyes closed.

"Here, a royal Bengal tiger submerges itself in a shady strip of water during a heatwave at Bangladesh national zoo in Dhaka. The capital saw the maximum temperature rise to 40.4 degrees Celsius this month, making it the city's hottest day in 58 years.

Asia has been experiencing weeks of “endless record heat”, with sweltering temperatures causing school closures and surges in energy use.

Record April temperatures have been recorded at monitoring stations across Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, as well as in China and South Asia.

In Thailand last weekend the authorities advised people in Bangkok and other areas of the country to stay home to avoid becoming ill. Temperatures hit 42C in the capital on Saturday, and the heat index – meaning what the temperature feels like combined with humidity – reached 54C.

Globally, 2022 ranked as one of the hottest years on recorded, and the past eight years were collectively the hottest documented by modern science.

“The poorest of the poor are going to [suffer] the most. Especially, it is devastating for the farming community, the people who are dependent on agriculture or fishing,” said Dr Fahad Saeed, regional lead for South Asia and the Middle East at Climate Analytics, a climate science policy institute.

“The heat is not foreign to this part of land,” he said, but added that temperatures were rising beyond the limits of people’s adaptability.

"“There was an explosion. ... We barely found our things and ran out” resident Olha Turina told Associated Press. “I don’t know why we have to go through all this. We never bothered anyone”.

Footage from the Ukrainian city of Uman, where at least 10 people were killed, shows an apartment building in flames and partially reduced to rubble after being destroyed in a Russian missile attack.

Russia has launched a deadly new wave of missile and drone attacks across many of Ukraine’s biggest cities in the early hours of the morning — the most intense bombing to hit the country in weeks.

The attack comes days after Ukraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, begged his allies for more air defence supplies.

One missile hit a building in Dnipro, killing a woman and a child, the city’s mayor said.

Ukrainian forces are expected to soon launch an offensive with new military equipment, including tanks, from its western allies after Russian forces made little headway during winter.

"“You cannot kill democracy that easily.”

In a defiant speech on Wednesday, trans politician, Zooey Zephyr, told Montana Republicans that they would have “blood on your hands” if they voted to ban gender-affirming medical care for trans children.

Zephyr said she was taking a stand for the LGBTQ+ community, her constituents in Missoula and “democracy itself”.

The Montana House Republicans responded by barring Zephyr - a Democratic representative -  from the statehouse floor for the rest of the session.

Under the terms of the punishment, Zephyr will still be able to vote remotely but will be unable to participate in debates on the floor for the remainder of the 90-day legislative session.

Zephyr had been forbidden from speaking for the past week over her comments, which Republicans said violated decorum.

“If you use decorum to silence people who hold you accountable, then all you’re doing is using decorum as a tool of oppression,” Zephyr said.

The punishment marks the first time in nearly 50 years that Montana lawmakers have sought such disciplinary action against a colleague.

The decision to silence Zephyr had already drawn protests that brought the statehouse to a halt on Monday as demonstrators demanded Zephyr be allowed to speak.

"“The royal links to slavery are more than just institutional, they are in the Windsor family heritage.”

Direct ancestors of King Charles III and the royal family bought and exploited enslaved people on tobacco plantations in Virginia, according to new research shared with the Guardian.

A document discovered in archives reveals that a direct ancestor of the king was involved in buying at least 200 enslaved people from the Royal African Company (RAC) in 1686.

The RAC, which traded almost 180,000 enslaved people, was granted royal charters by successive English kings. In the newly published document, senior RAC officials, describing themselves as “your loving friends”, instructed the captain of a ship to deliver “negroes” to Edward Porteus, a tobacco plantation owner in Virginia, and two other men. 

Porteus’s son, Robert, inherited his father’s estate before moving his family to England, in 1720. Later a direct descendant, Frances Smith, married the aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon. Their granddaughter was Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the late queen mother.

The documents establishing these royal roots were found by the researcher Desirée Baptiste, while investigating links between the Church of England and enslavers in Virginia, for a play she has written. “This means the royal links to slavery are more than just institutional, they are in the Windsor family heritage,” Baptiste said.

A palace spokesperson said that they were unable to comment until after the coronation - adding that the media operation was under “intense pressure” dealing with global interest in the coronation.

Earlier this month, in response to the Guardian’s reporting as part of our new series Cost of the crown, Charles signalled for the first time his support for research into the links between the British monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade.

"“We need some more humanity in this debate” said Scottish MP Stephen Flynn to Rishi Sunak during prime minister’s questions.

The SNP’s Westminster leader was pressing the PM on whether there were any safe or legal routes to the UK for children fleeing the war in Sudan – and whether his government intends to “detain and deport” Sudanese child refugees who come to the UK.

Sunak said that the government had spent £250m on aid to Sudan in the past five years.

The UN refugee agency estimates that around 270,000 refugees will try to flee over Sudan’s borders to escape from the escalating violence between the Sudanese army and Rapid Support Force (RSF), which UN Secretary-General António Guterres warns could cause “immense suffering for years”.

A temporary and fragile truce between the two sides is expected to hold until Thursday night, providing civilians a chance to escape the conflict. But there are many questions Sudanese people are having to ask themselves as they weigh up whether to leave their homes — and what awaits them if they do.

"Rupert Murdoch’s media business secretly paid Prince William a “very large sum of money” to quietly settle a phone-hacking claim, according to new court filings.

The Prince of Wales is said to have received the previously undisclosed payment in 2020 after bringing a legal claim against the owner of the Sun and the News of the World.

The claim was made in legal documents submitted by his brother, Prince Harry, as part of his own legal battle with the publisher, which returned to the high court today.

Harry told the court his attempts to seek an apology from Murdoch’s company over phone hacking were carried out with the approval of his grandmother the late Queen Elizabeth II.

The royal claims there was a secret agreement struck between royal family and “senior executives” at Murdoch’s company at some point before 2012. As part of this supposed deal the princes would delay legal proceedings against the newspaper group in return for receiving an apology at a later date.

Harry said the royal family did this after being scarred by the “Tampongate” incident when the Sun obtained a recorded phone call between Prince Charles and Camilla while the couple were having an affair in the 1980s.

A spokesperson for the company said “the Sun does not accept liability or make any admissions to the allegations”, emphasising that many of Harry’s claims dated back 20 years.

"Countries around the world have ramped up efforts to evacuate their citizens, staff and diplomats from Sudan, while thousands of people remain trapped amid deadly fighting in the north-eastern African nation.

The UK, Germany, Italy, Jordan and Canada were among those to begin evacuations, as fighting continues between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, with a series of ceasefires failing to hold.

The death toll in Sudan has passed 420, including 264 civilians, and more than 3,700 have been wounded, according to local and international NGOs. However, most analysts believe the true total of fatalities and injuries after more than nine days of fighting is much higher.

There was anger on the battered streets of the capital, Khartoum, where thousands remain trapped in the escalating conflict.

“They evacuated their people … the Americans do not care about Sudan … The safety of their people is a priority for them, we should not concentrate on that, we should think of ways to stop the war,” said Madji Ebaid, 61, a businessman.

Alaa Mustafa, a 33-year-old hospital lab assistant in Omdurman, said the evacuation by western countries showed that at least politicians in London or Washington “cared about their citizens”.

“Our leader might stop fighting but imagine only [allowing] the westerners to leave the country. What about us who are still here? There are so many humanitarian cases, and people who need emergency care. Their bodies are thrown on the streets.”

On Monday afternoon the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that the situation could engulf the whole region. He called for a ceasefire and said that humanitarian aid workers should be allowed in by both sides.

"""We hoped Stephen’s death would be the catalyst for real change, but the assurances proved hollow. That explains the policing crisis today,"" writes Imran Khan, the lawyer for Stephen Lawrence’s family.

It has been 30 years since Stephen Lawrence was killed in a racist attack as he made his way home with a friend in south-east London.

The response from the police was found to have been marred by institutional racism and a failure of leadership.

The campaigning led by Lawrence’s family and activists led to a profound and lasting impact on attitudes towards race in Britain.

Now, on the 30th anniversary of his death, Khan reflects on how far that change really went in UK policing.

"‘Why are Americans being shot for knocking on the wrong door?’

Within a week, there have been four unrelated shooting incidents where the victims made simple mistakes, such as knocking on the wrong door or trying to get into the wrong car.

”It’s hard to pinpoint the reasons why things have taken such a dire turn,” writes Guardian US columnist Francine Prose. 

“The increase in gun violence has put us all on edge. An uptick in impulsive, explosive, trigger-happy rage ramps up the fear and paranoia that has us warily eyeing our fellow passengers and shoppers.”

These cases have also revived concerns about “stand your ground” and other expanding self-defense laws. “Castle doctrine” laws in the US have long allowed people to kill intruders threatening their homes, but stand-your-ground policies extended that self-defense concept to the wider public sphere – with deadly consequences.

By 2012, 24 states had versions of “stand your ground”. And now, 38 states have similar statutes or equivalent legal precedents, according to a 2022 Reveal investigation.

"What would your guess have been? 💎

According to extensive research and analysis by the Guardian’s investigations team, King Charles III has inherited assets that have propelled his wealth to almost £2bn.

The monarch’s personal fortune is largely concealed from public scrutiny and it is impossible to know the complete value of his estate.

But, as part of our new series Cost of the Crown, a team of our reporters have conducted the first comprehensive audit of the king’s assets, from country piles and diamond-encrusted jewels, to paintings by Monet and Dalí, Rolls-Royces, racehorses and rare stamps. 

In a statement responding to our investigation the king’s spokesperson said: “While we do not comment on private finances, your figures are a highly creative mix of speculation, assumption and inaccuracy.”

Buckingham Palace declined to offer alternative figures; it has a policy of refusing to comment on the personal finances of royals, insisting they should “remain private, as they do for any other individual”.

The research into the king’s assets, however, reveals quite how different they are from those of any other individual. To read exactly why - and to learn more about what is actually the Windsor family’s most valuable financial asset – tap the link in our bio.

"Robin Buller was just under six weeks pregnant when she began to have “heavy bleeding” and “agonizing stabs of pain” on her right side. After rushing to the emergency department, an ultrasound confirmed her pregnancy had been ectopic, meaning it had implanted outside the uterus.

“In simpler terms, I was going to have an abortion and it was going to save my life,” Buller writes.

She was relieved that she didn’t live in one of the 13 states that have banned abortion since Roe v Wade was overturned last year. However, living in California didn’t shield her from other brutal features of American healthcare.

“I was not exempt from the fact that in the US, receiving abortion care – or any medical care – can be extremely expensive,"" she writes.

""At the end of it all, I was billed over $55,000, a number that felt unfathomable for someone who grew up in Canada, where under a publicly funded health system, an emergency abortion (or any abortion, for that matter) would yield no cost to an insured patient.""

After her private health insurance plan paid its part, she owed over $8,000 for a procedure without which she might have died.

""And as it turns out, I’m not alone. One New York woman was charged $80,000 for services related to the termination of an ectopic pregnancy – again, in a state with liberal abortion laws.""

Even in non-emergency situations, abortions in the US are expensive. Typically, where abortion care is legal, it costs between several hundred and several thousand dollars. At a non-profit like Planned Parenthood, abortion costs range from $550-800. At a hospital or private clinic, price tags can be much higher.

"'Truth matters'

Fox News and the voting equipment company Dominion have reached a $787.5m settlement, ending a dispute over whether Fox knowingly broadcast false and outlandish allegations that Dominion was involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election.

Though the case was settled, Dominion had unearthed a stunning trove of internal communications from Fox laying bare how top talent and hosts knew the outlandish claims about Dominion and a stolen election were false. 

The extensive messages offered a remarkable insight into how some of the most powerful hosts in America did not buy the allegations they were broadcasting to their audience each night.

Neither party immediately disclosed the terms of the settlement other than the dollar amount, and attorneys for Dominion declined to answer questions about whether it requires Fox to issue a retraction or a formal apology.

In a press conference outside the courthouse, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson said the more than $787m represents “vindication and accountability”.

“Truth matters,” he said. “Lies have consequences. The truth does not know red or blue,” he continued. “People across the political spectrum can and should disagree on issues, even of the most profound importance. But for our democracy to endure another 250 years and hopefully much longer, we must share a commitment to facts.”

In a statement, Fox said the settlement reflects its “continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards”.

“We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues,” the statement said.

"“Ringing a doorbell is not a crime.”

Widespread international outrage has erupted in response to the shooting of 16-year-old Black teenager Ralph Yarl in Missouri, and the subsequent police response.

White homeowner Andrew Lester, 84, has been charged with armed assault after he shot Yarl, a high school junior who was going to pick up his younger twin brothers from a play date when he went to the wrong address by mistake, authorities announced on Monday.

Zachary Thompson, the prosecuting attorney, announced the charges later that day after intense local protests over the police’s decision to briefly detain Lester before releasing him without charges.

Yarl was recovering at home after being released from hospital on Sunday, where he was being treated for gunshot wounds to his head and chest, his family said.

Lee Merritt, an attorney for the family, told the Guardian that the teenager suffered a fractured skull, a traumatic brain injury involving swelling, post-concussive syndrome and injuries to his arm.

“The family is elated that Ralph didn’t succumb to his injuries, but now they’re angry about the failure of the justice system to show any value or appreciation of his life,” Merritt said in an interview before the charges were announced.

The prominent civil rights lawyer Benjamin Crump is also representing the family, and earlier told CNN: “It is inescapable not to observe the racial dynamics here ... We can only imagine if the roles were reversed ...""

Stacey Graves, chief of the Kansas City police, defended the release of the unnamed homeowner on Sunday, citing Missouri law that states a person can be held for only 24 hours before being formally charged or released. She said her department was working quickly to prepare evidence for the Clay county prosecutor as its felony investigation continued.

“We recognise the frustration this can cause,” Graves told reporters. “I want everyone to know that I am listening, and I understand the concern we are receiving from the community.”

The winning photograph depicted two women from different generations in black and white.

In a statement on his website, @boriseldagsen said he “applied as a cheeky monkey” to find out if competitions would be prepared for AI images to enter. “They are not,” he added.

“We, the photo world, need an open discussion,” said Eldagsen. “A discussion about what we want to consider photography and what not. Is the umbrella of photography large enough to invite AI images to enter – or would this be a mistake?

“With my refusal of the award I hope to speed up this debate.”

He said this was a “historic moment” as it was the first time an AI image had won a prestigious international photography competition, adding: “How many of you knew or suspected that it was AI generated? Something about this doesn’t feel right, does it?

“AI images and photography should not compete with each other in an award like this. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award.”

It was the first such outbreak of fighting since both groups joined forces to oust the veteran Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019.

"The super bloom is back – but not everyone is super excited by it. 

After a string of dry years, people are once again descending on orange-saturated valleys across California and Arizona for a glimpse of the wild poppies.

The flowers are having a strong showing this year following a historically wet winter in the southwest US. In some regions you can even see the bright blankets of flowers from space.

The spectacle set off a frenzy four years ago when heavy winter rains coated huge swaths of land in the wildflowers, leading to a crush of tourists, influencers, selfies and environmental complaints.

“The flowers were beautiful; the scene was a nightmare,” said Lake Elsinore’s mayor, Natasha Johnson, in a February press conference, where she announced the closure of the canyon where the poppies were starting to grow.

This year there are calls for a greater awareness around the impact of such tourism.

Today is the third day of the four-day strike that junior doctors in England are staging over a pay dispute with the government.
The British Medical Association has called for a 35% pay rise to bring junior doctor salaries back to 2008-2009 levels and compensate for 15 years of below-inflation wage increases.

"How worried should we be about having TikTok on our phones?

The app, which has more than 1 billion global users, has been under increasing scrutiny over its links to China and ability to protect data.

TikTok bans on government phones are piling up across the world, with Australia the latest country to pull the plug, while plans to completely ban the platform in the US are on the horizon. The app has also been fined £12.7m for UK data protection law breaches, including the use of the personal data of children under 13 without parental consent.

But what does this actually mean for everyday TikTok users? Our UK technology editor, Alex Hern, explains the security fears surrounding TikTok, and whether they mean we should all be deleting the app.

A TikTok spokesperson said recent government bans were “based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics” in which the app played no part. “We remain committed to working with governments and partners to address any security concerns, but ask to be judged on facts, not fears, and treated equally to our competitors,” they said.

"For a period of 270 years, Britain’s monarchs had links to slavery.

As part of an investigation into royal wealth and finances, David Conn - the Guardian's investigations correspondent - revealed that thirteen British Kings and Queens have invested in, profited from, or supported transatlantic slave trade and slavery itself.

The Guardian has for the first time published a document showing the 1689 transfer of £1,000 of shares in the slave-trading Royal African Company to King William III, from Edward Colston, the company’s deputy governor - you can see this document on slide five.
Responding to the emergence of this document, King Charles has given explicit support for research into the monarchy’s ties to transatlantic slavery for the first time.

A spokesperson for the palace said: “This is an issue that His Majesty takes profoundly seriously. As His Majesty told the Commonwealth heads of government reception in Rwanda last year: ‘I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery’s enduring impact.’

"Exclusive: millions of lives could be saved by a groundbreaking set of new vaccines for a range of conditions including cancer, experts have said.

A leading pharmaceutical firm said it is confident that jabs for cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, and other conditions will be ready by 2030.

Studies into these vaccinations are also showing “tremendous promise”, with some researchers saying 15 years’ worth of progress has been “unspooled” in 12 to 18 months thanks to the success of the Covid jab.

Dr Paul Burton, the chief medical officer of pharmaceutical company Moderna, said he believes the firm will be able to offer such treatments for “all sorts of disease areas” in as little as five years.

The firm, which created one of the leading coronavirus vaccines, is developing cancer vaccines that target different tumour types.

Burton said: “We will have that vaccine and it will be highly effective, and it will save many hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. I think we will be able to offer personalised cancer vaccines against multiple different tumour types to people around the world.”

He also said that multiple respiratory infections could be covered by a single injection – allowing vulnerable people to be protected against Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – while mRNA therapies could be available for rare diseases for which there are currently no drugs.

"Republicans in Tennessee have been accused of 'overt racism' after expelling two Black Democrats from the state legislature. 

In an act of unprecedented retaliation, Republicans removed the two lawmakers for joining a gun control protest following the Nashville shooting, while sparing a white Democrat who also participated.

Justin Jones, representative for Nashville, and Justin Pearson, who represented Memphis, gave rousing speeches in the chamber before the majority-white legislature voted to oust them, leaving tens of thousands of mostly Black and Brown Tennessee residents without representation.

Justin Jones, 27, said he had “no regrets, and would continue to speak up for Tennesseans who are demanding change”.

“What happened yesterday was an attack on our democracy and overt racism,” he said. “The nation got to see clearly what’s going on in Tennessee, that we don’t have democracy especially when it comes to Black and Brown communities. This is what we have been challenging all session, a very toxic, racist work environment.”

Jones said Republican lawmakers were trying to take Tennessee backwards, and pointed to the state’s history of white supremacy, the birthplace of the ultra-violent Ku Klux Klan.

Meanwhile Gloria Johnson, the white Democrat spared expulsion by a one-vote margin, was asked by reporters about the split vote as she left the chamber on Thursday.

“I’ll answer your question; it might have to do with the color of our skin,” said Johnson, a retired teacher.

Republican lawmakers denied allegations of racism, and said the expulsions were necessary to avoid setting a precedent that lawmakers’ disruptions of proceedings through protest would be tolerated.

"“When I found out I was HSP it truly changed and saved my life,"" tweeted comedian Miranda Hart.

The term Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) was coined in 1996 by psychologist Elaine Aron, who argued that sensitive brains are uniquely wired to process their environment at a deep level.

Her theory’s most striking claim is that physical and emotional sensitivity are one and the same. An intricate attention to body language heightens empathy; responsiveness to subtle physical cues creates rich sensations in HSPs, but can also overwhelm. Scratchy clothes, smells, background talk – unable to filter the noise, they soak up every drop.

We spoke with @jenngranneman, one of the writers of a new book on the subject, Sensitive: The Power of a Thoughtful Mind in an Overwhelming World.

The HSP hashtag has more than 498m views on TikTok, while Lorde, Nicole Kidman, Alanis Morissette, and Kanye West have publicly identified as such. HSPs make up about 30% of the population, so do you think you could you be one?

"Donald Trump turned himself in at a Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday, an extraordinary scene that marks the first time in American history a former US president has faced criminal charges.

Trump, the leading contender for the 2024 Republican nomination, arrived at the lower Manhattan courthouse at about 1pm ET, escorted by Secret Service agents, as supporters and protesters demonstrated outside.

He was set to be arraigned, fingerprinted and possibly photographed. Though defendants charged with felonies are typically handcuffed, Trump’s legal team has said he would not be.

The unprecedented proceedings were slated to be brief but remarkable, as the twice-impeached former president learns the indictment against him, and, as expected, enters a plea of not guilty to charges related to his role in a hush-money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels, made days before the 2016 election.

“There’s a lot of mystery here because we’re doing something that’s never been done before,” Joe Tacopina, a Trump lawyer, told ABC’s Good Morning America on Tuesday.

After the arraignment, Trump plans to return to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, where his campaign has scheduled a primetime news event with hundreds of high-profile supporters and possibly some of his most loyal allies on Capitol Hill.

"""Sleep is one of the most powerful things you can do for your body.""

Many of us are hoping for a happier, healthier life in 2023. We may already be trying lifestyle changes, but, regardless of your specific goal, it is hard to achieve anything when you haven't had enough sleep.

On the flip side, everything seems more possible when you are well rested. Sleep boosts the immune system, regulates mood and metabolism, and can make you more productive, patient or creative.

In his book, The Seven-Day Sleep Prescription, psychologist Aric Prather claims that, while we are built for sleep, many of us still struggle to overcome insomnia; “Sleep is one of the most powerful things you can do for your body. It’s just critical to make that a priority. Life is hard, there is always stress, sleep is disrupted, but there are things we can do.”

“The Scott Trust is deeply sorry for the role John Edward Taylor and his backers played in the slavery economy. We recognise that apologising and sharing these facts transparently is only the first step in addressing the Guardian’s historical links to transatlantic slavery, which was a crime against humanity,"" said Ole Jacob Sunde, chair of the Scott Trust which owns the Guardian.

“In response to the findings, the Scott Trust is committing to fund a restorative justice programme over the next decade, which will be designed and carried out in consultation with descendant communities in the US, Jamaica, the UK and elsewhere, centred on long-term initiatives and meaningful impact.

“These are significant new facts about the Guardian’s origin story, and they must therefore inform our purpose as we move forward, pushing us to do more to reflect the society we aspire to, alongside the radical history of Peterloo which originally inspired our values and our mission.”

"Donald Trump has been indicted in New York, over a hush money payment made to the adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election, the New York Times reported on Thursday. The paper cited four people with knowledge of the matter.

No former US president has ever been criminally indicted. The news is set to shake the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, in which Trump leads most polls.

Trump also faces legal jeopardy over his election subversion and incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress; his attempts to overturn the 2020 result in Georgia; his retention of classified records; his business dealings; and a defamation suit arising from an allegation of rape by the writer E Jean Carroll, which Trump denies.

Daniels claims an affair with Trump in 2006. Trump denies the affair but has admitted directing his then lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to pay Daniels $130,000 for her silence.

Cohen was also revealed to have arranged for $150,000 to be paid to Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who claimed to have an affair with Trump.

That payment was made by David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper, which squashed the story.

"These names are a fragment of the whole picture.

Attempting to trace all the human beings enslaved and forced to work on the sugar and cotton plantations that lined the pockets of the Manchester Guardian’s founders is complex, and building a full picture of their lives is near impossible.

As Dr Cassandra Gooptar, who conducted this research, writes: “The historically whitewashed narrative of Britain’s legacy of slavery and colonialism tended to treat the enslaved as a distant, abstract construct or statistic in a distant land.”

The effort to tell a different story – in an attempt to restore dignity and humanity – involves relying on sources that were not compiled with dignity in mind, such as lists of “confiscated property” or “contraband” after the US civil war, or newspaper ads placed to find “runaways” with crude descriptions of ethnicity, age or characteristics, as well as bills of sales. The ages are often written as approximate, and the names may not have been of their own choosing.

"“Funny, brave, fearless, kind”

Tributes have been pouring in for Paul O’Grady, the beloved TV host and comedian, who has died at the age of 67.

His partner Andre Portasio confirmed in a statement that O’Grady died “unexpectedly but peacefully” on Tuesday evening.

Portasio said: “He will be greatly missed by his loved ones, friends, family, animals and all those who enjoyed his humour, wit and compassion.

“I know that he would want me to thank you for all the love you have shown him over the years.”

O’Grady was best known for hosting Bafta-winning talkshow The Paul O’Grady Show, Blankety Blank, the reboot of Blind Date, and also for his drag queen persona Lily Savage, which saw him first break on to comedy the scene.

Tributes poured in early on Wednesday. “Such sad news,” TV presenter Lorraine Kelly wrote on Twitter. “Paul O’Grady - funny, fearless, brave, kind and wise ... I always think dogs are the best judge of character and they ADORED him.”

LGBTQ+ rights campaigner Peter Tatchell remembered O’Grady as “one of the loveliest people you could ever meet ...""

A well-known animal lover who kept dogs, pigs, bats, ferrets and more at his farm in Kent, O’Grady also presented the award-winning show For The Love Of Dogs. He won an RSPCA Animal Hero award for his “outstanding contribution to animal welfare”.

Throughout his career he was famously outspoken about the neglect of care workers, austerity and the Tory party: he made headlines when he said he wanted to see David Cameron and George Osborne’s “heads on spikes on Tower Bridge” over austerity cuts, and revealed that he quit his talkshow because celebrities were so dull they were like “relatives you felt obliged to visit”.

O’Grady wrote a four-volume memoir and in 2008 he was awarded an MBE for his services to entertainment. When described as a national treasure in an interview with the Observer in 2017, he responded: “Oh, what a terrible phrase. That wasn’t planned.”

"Israel’s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is facing pressure to announce a halt to his far-right government’s proposals to overhaul the judiciary after 12 weeks of escalating political crisis.

Hospitals, universities, and the country’s largest trade union announced a general strike on Monday morning, while Tel Aviv’s airport, Israel’s main international gateway, began cancelling flights. Local municipalities, nurseries, civil servants and tech workers have also joined the action.

The strikes come after a dramatic night of protests sparked by Netanyahu’s decision to sack his defence minister for opposing the judicial plans, and builds on significant pushback from the military, Israel’s vital hi-tech sector, and allies in the US.

Israeli media outlets, citing sources in Netanyahu’s Likud party, reported on Monday morning that in a televised address the prime minister was expected to announce a freeze to the bitterly contested legislation, which would limit the powers of the country’s supreme court.

While members of the Likud, as well as ultra-Orthodox coalition partners, appeared to have finally caved to the months of public pressure, the extremist security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, warned in a tweet that the prime minister must not “surrender to anarchy”.

If the judicial overhaul is paused or scrapped and the government collapses, the country could once again be headed for elections.

Weather service meteorologists estimated that the tornado was on the ground for more than one hour and traveled at least 170 miles, a distance that they described as “very, very rare”.

Twenty-five people were killed and dozens injured in Mississippi and another man died in the neighboring state of Alabama.

"Would you live in a micro-apartment? 🏠🇯🇵

Our Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, spent a night in one of the city's micro-apartments and was ""quite surprised by how cosy it is.""

The tiny homes measure just nine square metres – just under half the size of a typical studio apartment in the city – and our growing in popularity in Tokyo, but why?

They are cheap, rents for micro-apartments can be as low as ¥50,000 ($376; £311) a month, rising to ¥80,000 in more fashionable locations.

This is why many young people who are unable to afford the capital’s high, and rising, rents are living in these tiny homes.

But critics say the micro-apartments boom highlights the lack of affordable urban housing for young, underpaid workers, with quality of life sacrificed for convenience and affordability.

"What do you think of this kissing device?

A Chinese start-up has invented a long-distance kissing machine that transmits users’ kiss data collected through motion sensors hidden in silicon lips, which simultaneously move when replaying kisses received.

MUA – named after the sound people commonly make when blowing a kiss – also captures and replays sound and warms up slightly during kissing, making the experience more authentic, said Beijing-based Siweifushe.

Users can even download kissing data submitted via an accompanying app by other users. The invention was inspired by lockdown isolation. At their most severe, China’s lockdowns saw authorities forbid residents to leave their apartments for months on end.

“I was in a relationship back then, but I couldn’t meet my girlfriend due to lockdowns,” said inventor Zhao Jianbo.

Then a student at the Beijing Film Academy, he focused his graduate project on the lack of physical intimacy in video calls. He later set up Siweifushe which released MUA, its first product, on 22 January. The device is priced at 260 yuan ($38).

In the two weeks after its release, the firm sold over 3,000 kissing machines and received about 20,000 orders, he said.

The MUA resembles a mobile stand with colourless pursed lips protruding from the front. To use it, lovers must download an app on to their smartphones and pair their kissing machines. When they kiss the device, it kisses back.

It has received mixed reviews, with some users saying it was intriguing while others said it made them feel uncomfortable. Among the top complaints was its lack of tongue.

Some commentators on social media site Weibo also expressed concern that the device could be used for online erotic content, which is strictly regulated in China.

"Draped in an Aboriginal flag, independent Australian senator Lidia Thorpe was pulled to the ground while attempting to storm the podium of controversial UK anti-trans activist Kellie-Jay Keen.

The Canberra Times’ Sarah Basford Canales recorded the moment before Thorpe was physically stopped by police from taking the stage at a rally held by Keen in the capital.

Thorpe told @guardianaustralia that transphobia is not welcome on Aboriginal land. “As a sovereign black woman I’ve come to let these people know that they are not welcome on this country.

""We do not tolerate this … on Ngunnawal and Ngambri country.”

Australian Federal Police said the incident involving Thorpe had been referred to the AFP's professional standards command after the senator complained about the actions of officers.

Thorpe was part of a counter-protest to the event of more than 100 people, which outnumbered the crowd of around 30 supporters who had come to see Keen speak as part of a national tour of Australia.

"Why are the streets of Paris covered in rubbish?

The past two week have seen more than 10,000 tins of waste pile high across France's capital after the city's rubbish collectors went on strike.

This action is part of a larger nationwide protest against Emmanuel Macron's unpopular pension reform, which he controversially pushed through without a parliament vote.

The reform raises the retirement age by two years, from 62 to 64 for most and from 57 to 59 for trash collectors.

"""The force has had almost 30 years to put its house in order. It has not done so, either because it does not want to or it does not know how to.""

On 22 April 1993, Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old aspiring architect, was stabbed to death by a gang of racists in an unprovoked attack in south-east London.

In 1999, the Macpherson inquiry concluded that institutional racism contributed to the Metropolitan police’s failure to bring Stephen’s attackers to justice. In 2012, two men were jailed for murder, but others remain free.

Now, more than 20 years later, a new landmark report by Louise Casey, released today, has found that the capital’s police force has institutional problems with racism, misogyny and homophobia.

In response to the damning findings, Lady Lawrence, Stephen's mother, said: “It comes as no surprise to me that the report [...] has found that the Metropolitan police is riddled with deep-seated racism, sexism and homophobia. My suspicion that racism played a critical part in the failure of the Metropolitan police to properly investigate my son’s death in 1993 was borne out by the Macpherson report.

“Since then, despite repeated reassurances that the Metropolitan police had learned lessons from its failures, discrimination in every form is clearly rampant in its ranks.""

Lady Casey's report was commissioned after the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard in 2021 by serving firearms officer Wayne Couzens.

The 363-page report leaves no stone unturned, addressing the culture of bullying and harassment, and senior leadership’s inability to adequately address the mounting number of scandals within Britain’s biggest police force.

"“I am scared of the police. I don’t trust my own organisation.”

This is how one openly gay police officer describes being left feeling at the hands of his colleagues after being the “target of a sustained campaign of homophobia”. He says he joined the Metropolitan police – Britain's largest force – to “be there for the people who need us”.

His is just one of the alarming stories to emerge from the damning Casey review, which has exposed the institutional racism, misogyny and homophobia and inside the capital's police force.

The 363-page report details disturbing testimonies from officers on “banter culture”, humiliation of junior staff being urinated on in the showers to the shocking and deep-rooted mistreatment and abuse of LGBTQ+, female, Black, Asian and minority ethnic officers.

Multiple officers also report their treatment, only for their cases to be ignored and dismissed by a system the report describes as having a “culture of denial”.

One female officer who the report says was a victim of domestic and sexual abuse at the hands of a fellow Met officer during a long-term relationship, and who was so ‘distraught’ at the force’s handling of the case that she attempted suicide, was told days after Sarah Everard’s murder that her case was not being taken forward.

“The Met was coming out saying ‘we hate violence against women and girls, we stand against this’, and I was thinking no you don’t. It made me rage. Did I need to die in order for you to take me seriously?” the officer said in the Casey report.

“It feels like a lonely place trying to forge this change and a better Met.”

Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has said that he is “embarrassed” by the findings and that he accepted Casey’s factual findings about racism, misogyny and homophobia in his organisation and they were systemic, but neither he nor the Met would accept they were “institutional”, claiming it was a political term.

This is the ""final warning"" from scientists on the climate crisis.

The message was delivered as the final part of the UN's six-part climate report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and took hundreds of scientists eight years to compile and runs to thousands of pages.

The IPCC set out the devastation that has already been inflicted on swathes of the world.

Extreme weather caused by climate breakdown has led to increased deaths from intensifying heatwaves in all regions, millions of lives and homes destroyed in droughts and floods, millions of people facing hunger, and “increasingly irreversible losses” in vital ecosystems.

"More than 300 people were arrested across France last night during spontaneous protests against a decision by the president, Emmanuel Macron, to bypass parliament and force through unpopular pension changes, including raising the retirement age from 62 to 64.

Macron instructed the prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, to invoke article 49.3 of the constitution, which allows the government to adopt a bill without a parliamentary vote, because he said there was too much economic risk to the country if MPs voted against the bill.

As opposition politicians accused the government of a brutal and undemocratic approach, demonstrators gathered in Paris and other cities. About 200 protesters briefly blocked traffic on the Paris ring road early on Friday morning.

These protests occurred against a backdrop of two months of coordinated nationwide strikes and some of the biggest protests in decades, including a bin collectors' strike in Paris, during which waste piled high in the streets.

Unions immediately called for another day of mass strikes and protests for next Thursday, calling the government’s move “a complete denial of democracy”.

Opposition parties will call a vote of no confidence in the government on Monday.

"“Hope is our biggest currency right now”

The 2023 presidential election in Nigeria saw a marked rise in engagement by young people, many of whom rallied around the outsider candidate Peter Obi, who stood for the Labour party.

The vote was largely peaceful but the turnout was low - just 27%, a figure blamed in part on millions of Nigerians being unable to cast a ballot. The slow tallying of results angered voters and opposition parties, who allege vote-rigging.

Bola Tinubu, of the ruling All Progressives Congress, was declared the winner. The former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, 76, of the opposition People’s Democratic party, came second, and Obi third. The ruling party denied manipulating results.

Last week, the electoral commission said it was pushing back polling to elect state governors due to problems with the digital voting system experienced in the presidential vote on 25 February.

Obi is now contesting the result in the country’s highest court of appeal. The Labour party candidate, who for many, especially young voters, represented hope for change, said the election “will go down as one of the most controversial elections ever conducted in Nigeria”.

The observation was among the first made by the James Webb space telescope following its launch in late 2021, but the picture was not released until this week.

This star in the constellation Sagitta, officially known as WR 124, already has shed enough material to account for 10 suns, according to Nasa.

Webb’s infrared eyes observed all the gas and dust flung into space by a huge, hot star 15,000 light years away. A light year is about 5.8tn miles.

Shimmering in purple like a cherry blossom, the cast-off material once comprised the star’s outer layer. The Hubble space telescope snapped a shot of the same transitioning star a few decades ago, but it appeared more like a fireball without the delicate details.

Such a transformation occurs only with some stars and normally is the last step before they explode, going supernova, according to scientists.

"More than 200 people have been killed in Malawi and Mozambique after Cyclone Freddy triggered floods and landslips.

Rescue workers have warned that the death toll is likely to rise as they scoured destroyed neighbourhoods for survivors even as hopes dwindled.

Freddy could be the longest-lasting cyclone on record, having weakened and strengthened several times.

The fierce storm hit south-eastern Africa at the weekend, in its second landfall since late February after brewing off Australia and traversing the Indian Ocean.

It reached landlocked Malawi early on Monday after sweeping through Mozambique. Malawi’s government said at least 190 people were killed with 584 injured and 37 missing, while authorities in neighbouring Mozambique reported 20 deaths and 24 injured.

Many people died in mudslides that washed away homes in the country’s commercial capital, Blantyre.

Mayeso Chinthenga, 14, said his family’s house was taken by the cascading mud. “We were out looking for firewood when we saw rocks rolling down the mountain so we ran for safety. Some of our neighbours died on the spot,” he said at a nearby school.

Emails and messages were shown to the Guardian amid concern among some BBC insiders that the corporation has been too cowed by the government in recent years.

"These new statistics reveal “the staggering scale of violence against women and girls” and have “deeply worrying implications for women’s already low levels of trust in the criminal justice system”, says Farah Nazeer, the chief executive of Women’s Aid.

According to new data from the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), overall, 1,483 unique allegations were reported against 1,539 police officers – or 0.7% of the workforce. These included 1,177 cases of alleged police-perpetrated violence, including sexual harassment and assault, reported between October 2021 and April 2022.

Just over half the cases were conduct matters, which are usually raised by a colleague within the force. The remaining cases were complaints from the public.

The deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth, the National Police Chiefs’ Council coordinator for violence against women and girls, said she wanted to see more officers investigated, disciplined and sacked for crimes and misconduct against women and girls.

She said the figures “reinforce the urgency and importance of our current mission to lift the stones and root abusers and corrupt individuals out of policing. The vast majority of officers and staff are professional and committed but I know it is shocking to hear about any potential predators in policing and that this can further shake fragile trust.”

She added that the data was from a year ago and therefore did not reflect work done over the past 18 months to identify wrongdoing, strengthen misconduct investigations and toughen sanctions. She said she hoped that future iterations would show “the impact of those changes”, including giving more women the confidence to report concerns.

Publishing an annual assessment of police performance is a new step taken by the NPCC and College of Policing to improve responses to violence against women and girls, and to tackle rampant sexism and misogyny in the force.

The moves are part of efforts to tackle misogyny in policing after scandals including the case of David Carrick, a former police officer who was found to be a prolific sex offender, and the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer.

"'What we're seeing here is segregation.'

The worst 10 hotspots for fine particle air pollution in the US have been revealed by the Guardian in an analysis using cutting-edge modelling.

The findings show that, across the contiguous US, the neighborhoods burdened by the worst pollution are overwhelmingly the same places where Black and Hispanic populations live. Race is more of a predictor of air pollution exposure than income level, researchers have found.

“What we’re seeing here is segregation,” said Julian Marshall, one of the researchers who helped create the computer model. “You have segregation of people and segregation of pollution.”

The fine particles of air pollution emitted by cars, factories, wildfires and dusty agricultural activities, known to researchers as PM2.5, are small enough to travel deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream, increasing death rates from causes like respiratory disease, heart attacks and strokes.

New research is showing they are associated with a surprising array of health impacts, ranging from miscarriages and Covid-19 to kidney damage and blood infections.

More than 2m households fell into fuel poverty last year and in one community in north-east England, a group of women are pulling together amidst the deepening cost of living crisis to make sure everyone is supported.

The Guardian spent a week with volunteers at Shiremoor North Tyneside - a centre which doubles as a warm bank - a space where people can go to heat up for free if they can’t afford to turn on the heating in their home. 

The team are getting requests for food, period products, blankets and seeing families forced to choose between heating and eating everyday. But it comes at a cost, according to the founder Janine, who says they are close to breaking point.

"“The picture of us that is being drawn by government and far right is very saddening. The world needs to understand that we are human and should be treated like humans.”

This is what a 20-year-old asylum seeker who recently left Home Office accommodation in Kent said about the government's proposed new legislation, which will see asylum seekers arriving in the UK via small boats detained and deported.

Unveiling the plans to Conservatives, Braverman admitted the illegal migration bill was “more than 50%” likely to break human rights laws.

Braverman and Rishi Sunak have claimed the measures will successfully deter people from crossing the Channel. However, neither the home secretary nor the prime minister have been able to set out details on new detention facilities to accommodate the detained refugees or when people will be able to be deported to Rwanda.

“We’re not breaking the law, and no government representative has said that we’re breaking the law,” Braverman told Sky News on Wednesday.

The UN refugee agency said it was “profoundly concerned” by the bill’s provisions, which would give the government the right to criminalise, detain and deport asylum seekers, saying it would be a “clear breach of the refugee convention”.

Rights groups, politicians and charities have also been quick to condemn the immigration bill.

“Seeking asylum is not a crime, and those forced to flee their homes deserve compassion, dignity and the right to fair treatment. Conflict and persecution do not exist only within the confines of countries that the UK government deems worthy of a visa scheme,"" said Katy Chakrabortty, head of policy and advocacy at Oxfam GB.

In 2022, 45,755 men, women and children crossed the Channel in small boats to reach the UK, most of whom then claimed asylum. Nearly 3,000 people have already made the crossing this year, with official estimates expecting more than 80,000 this year.

"On a beach in Senegal with so much litter that much of the sand is covered, one man is trying to raise awareness about the dangers of plastics - with a very noticeable outfit.

Environmental activist Modou Fall, who many simply call “Plastic Man”, wears his uniform of bags, cups and other rubbish - which he emphasises “is not a costume” - while travelling across the country to tell as many people as will listen about the problems of plastic waste.

In 2020, Senegal passed a law that banned some plastic products. But, with single use plastic continuing to pile up in the water around the capital city Dakar, the country is struggling to enforce the ban.

"It started three months ago, when girls in the Iranian city of Qom reported a strange smell of tangerines at their school. Some began to experience trouble breathing, nausea and numbness. Eighteen of them were taken to hospital. They appeared to have been poisoned.

Today, the number of girls with symptoms in similar circumstances stands at more than 1,104 in 15 cities across the country.

Last week, as dozens more schoolgirls were admitted to hospital, the Iranian government acknowledged the events for the first time.

Many believe that the suspected attacks are part of an extremist response – perhaps with tacit state endorsement – to the protests led by women and girls that have convulsed Iran since the death of Mahsa Amini in September 2022.

But there are also suggestions that some of the cases may be evidence of mass sociogenic illness – symptoms without a biomedical cause – triggered by the repression of schoolgirls who have played a leading role in that movement.

With teenagers systematically targeted by the security services for their part in the protests, there were new protests in Tehran over the weekend over a perceived escalation in the threat to the country’s children – and more hospital admissions.

Since the start of the year, when its last 10 senators left office, Haiti has been without a single democratically elected government official.

After the assassination of Haiti’s former president Jovenel Moïse in July 2021, gangs have gained control of territories across the country, including 60% of the capital, Port-au-Prince.

Co-organiser Emily Eavis is facing criticism after the festival confirmed a lineup of all-male headliners for this year’s event.

She said festivals are struggling with a dearth of viable female headliners owing to an industry “pipeline” problem - adding that there needs to be more investment in female musicians to create future headliners.

52% of the 54 names on this week’s partial lineup announcement – with many more acts still to come – are male. Eavis said she remained “entirely focused on balancing our bill. It’s not just about gender, it’s about every aspect of diversity.” 46% of those 54 names are non-white, or feature non-white members.

"Israel and Palestine jump from crisis to crisis, but a string of brutal and deadly attacks over the past few weeks has raised fears that the Holy Land is spiralling toward unrelenting bloodshed.

There is speculation that the region is on the brink of an intifada – a Palestinian uprising or, literally, a “shaking off” of Israeli control. The first two uprisings were cracked down on hard, failed to end the occupation and left several thousand people dead, mostly Palestinians. Some believe a third intifada has already started.

Matt Hancock is facing a series of claims based on a leaked cache of more than 100,000 WhatsApp messages that provide an insight into the way the UK government operated at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

They include the suggestion that, while health secretary, he rejected advice from England’s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, to test everyone going into care homes in England for Covid-19.

Hancock vehemently denies overruling clinical advice. A spokesperson called the claim “categorically untrue”.

"23,003 people died in England during 2022 after spending at least 12 hours in an A&E waiting for care or to be admitted to a bed, according to analysis of NHS figures by emergency care doctors.

The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) says that equates to roughly one death every 23 minutes, 63 every day, 442 a week or 1,917 each month.

The college said its findings, while “shocking”, were also “unsurprising” and reflected the fact that emergency departments are often overwhelmed and unable to find patients a bed in the hospital.

NHS England disputed the RCEM’s findings but did not indicate how many avoidable deaths it thinks are occurring due to A&E delays.

“The cause of excess deaths is down to a number of different factors and so attributing deaths to one exact thing, as the figures quoted by the RCEM attempt to do, is very unlikely to give a full or certain picture”, a spokesperson said.

“It therefore would not be appropriate for NHSE to recognise these as fact and it is right that the experts at the ONS – as the executive branch of the statistics authority – continue to analyse excess deaths.

“The data highlighted looks at time in A&E rather than waits and covers a year when the NHS experienced four record-breaking months for attendances in A&E.”

Rosie Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ health spokesperson, said “patients are now dying in their droves” due to successive Conservative governments neglecting the NHS, and added that the lives lost due to A&E snarl-ups constituted a “national disaster”.

It has been warning since last September that up to 500 deaths have been occurring every week in A&Es in England because so many patients have spent so long there – a claim the NHS denies.

"At least 36 people have been killed and 85 injured after two trains collided near the town of Tempe in central Greece, the fire brigade said.

The two trains – a passenger train travelling from Athens to the northern city of Thessaloniki, and a cargo train from Thessaloniki to Larissa, collided head-on outside the central Greek city, Konstantinos Agorastos, the governor of the Thessaly region, told local media.

“The collision was very strong,” he said, adding that the first four carriages had derailed, while the first two were “almost completely destroyed”.

Agorastos said about 194 passengers were evacuated safely to Thessaloniki on buses.

Rail operator Hellenic Train said the northbound passenger train had about 350 passengers on board.

Survivors said several passengers were thrown through the windows of the train cars due to the impact. They said others fought to free themselves after the passenger train buckled, slamming into a field next to the tracks.

“There was panic in the carriage, people were screaming,” a young man who was evacuated to a nearby bridge told SKAI.

“We just heard a bang … the [train] car started spinning, before ending up sideways when we managed to exit,” another passenger told ERT, Greece’s public broadcaster.

“It was 10 nightmarish seconds with fire, you couldn’t see much from the smoke,” another passenger said.

Now decades later, the brutal murder of a young woman in Tehran last September has reignited her need to fight for equality in her homeland. Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested by the Iranian morality police for wearing her hijab 'improperly', but collapsed and died in custody a few days later. Haleh describes it as a moment that has changed the lives of British Iranians forever.

Her death has sparked huge international outrage and protest. In the UK, the Iranian community continues to turn out weekly to show solidarity with the movement in Iran, spearheaded by women and teenagers, demanding fundamental rights for women and pushing for a change in Iranian leadership.

This is what Lamar Abusarees, a Palestinian girl living in the town of Hawara, said as she recounted how Israeli settlers attacked her home overnight in the worst outburst of settler violence in the northern West Bank in decades.

Photos and video on social media showed large fires burning throughout the town and lighting up the sky.

As footage of the attacks dominated the evening news, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called for calm.

“Let the IDF [Israeli Defence Forces] complete the pursuit, don't take the law into your hands,” he said.

The violence was condemned by the Palestinian Authority, EU and UK.

"Exceptionally low tides and a lack of rain in Venice has left some of the city’s famous canals almost dry.

Weeks of dry winter weather have raised concerns that Italy could face another drought after last summer’s emergency, with the Alps having received less than half of their normal snowfall, according to scientists and environmental groups.

Venice, where flooding is normally the primary concern, faces unusually low tides that are making it impossible for gondolas, water taxis and ambulances to navigate some of its famous canals.

The Po, Italy’s longest river which runs from the Alps in the north-west to the Adriatic has 61% less water than normal at this time of year.

Latest weather forecasts do however signal the arrival of much-needed precipitation and snow in the Alps in coming days.

In July last year, Italy suffered its worst drought for 70 years and declared a state of emergency in the areas surrounding the Po, which accounts for roughly a third of the country’s agricultural production.

“We are in a water deficit situation that has been building up since the winter of 2020-2021,” climate expert Massimiliano Pasqui was quoted as saying by daily Corriere della Sera.“We need 50 days of rain.""

These were the words protesters in Iran were heard repeating as they marched through the streets of multiple cities in the most widespread demonstrations in weeks, online videos appear to show on Friday.

The demonstrations overnight on Thursday marked 40 days since Iran executed Mohammad Mahdi Karami and Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini on charges related to protests that began last year.

Videos showed demonstrations in Iran’s capital, Tehran, as well as in the cities of Arak, Isfahan, Izeh in Khuzestan province and Karaj, the group Human Rights Activists in Iran said.

In Iran’s western Kurdish regions, online videos shared by the Hengaw Organisation for Human Rights showed burning roadblocks in Sanandaj, which has seen repeated demonstrations since Amini’s death.

Many of the videos had been blurred or showed grainy night-time scenes.

The initial unrest – which began in September after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini three days after her arrest by “morality police” – morphed into one of the most serious challenges to Iran’s theocracy since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

"“You don’t know what we’re going through.”

A white supremacist who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, last year was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday after listening to relatives of his victims express their pain and rage.

The sentencing hearing for Payton Gendron was disrupted when he was charged at by a man in the audience who was quickly restrained. It resumed after about 10 minutes, with more emotional testimony from people who talked about losing loved ones in the attack.

The disruption in the sentencing hearing happened as Barbara Massey Mapps excoriated Gendron for killing her 72-year-old sister, Katherine Massey. As Mapps shouted and pointed at Gendron, a person in the audience took a few steps toward him before getting held back.

“You don’t know what we’re going through,” the man shouted as he was led away by court officers. The court said it will not take legal action against the man.

19-year-old Gendron wore bullet-resistant armor and a helmet equipped with a live-streaming camera as he carried out the 14 May attack with a semiautomatic rifle purchased legally but modified so he could load it with illegal high-capacity ammunition magazines.

Sturgeon says she has been ‘wrestling’ with resignation for ‘some weeks’ but knows the “time is now” for her to stand down, adding that it is “right for me, for my party and for the country”.

She has indicated she will continue on the backbenches as an MSP at Holyrood, saying in Scotland there are now “stronger protections for victims of domestic abuse, and parliament will soon consider legislation to improve access to justice for victims of rape and sexual offences”.

"A team of Israeli contractors who claim to have manipulated more than 30 elections around the world using hacking, sabotage and automated disinformation on social media has been exposed in a new investigation.

The unit is run by Tal Hanan, a 50-year-old former Israeli special forces operative who now works privately using the pseudonym “Jorge”, and appears to have been working under the radar in elections in various countries for more than two decades.

He is being unmasked by an international consortium of journalists. Hanan and his unit, which uses the codename “Team Jorge”, have been exposed by undercover footage and documents leaked to the Guardian.

Hanan did not respond to detailed questions about Team Jorge’s activities and methods but said: “I deny any wrongdoing.”

"Warning: this post contains graphic descriptions of sexual violence

More than four months after the death of Mahsa Amini, the Kurdish woman who died in police custody after being arrested for incorrectly wearing her hijab, the Iranian authorities’ attempts to crush nationwide protests have seen more than 500 people killed by security forces, including 71 children. 

Four protesters have so far been executed by the state, with many more facing the death sentence.

According to the latest report by Human Rights Activists in Iran, at least 19,763 individuals have been arrested in connection with the protests and thousands remain in detention.

Recently, Amnesty International released a detailed report confirming allegations of rape, violence and “extreme torture” of protesters in detention.

The Guardian has spoken to 11 protesters, women and men, who claim that they were subjected to rape, sexual violence, beatings and torture while being detained by security forces. Some say they were assaulted in a police van or on the streets; others while in custody in police stations or prisons.

"‘This is just wild’

A Guardian investigation has revealed that AI tools rate photos of women as more sexually suggestive than those of men, especially if nipples, pregnant bellies or exercise is involved.

Gianluca Mauro (@gianluca.mauro) and Hilke Schellmann (@hilke_s) used AI tools developed by large technology companies, including Google and Microsoft, to analyze hundreds of photos of men and women.

They found evidence that the AI tags photos of women in everyday situations as sexually suggestive. They also rate pictures of women as more 'racy' or sexually suggestive than comparable pictures of men.

As a result, the social media companies that leverage these or similar algorithms have suppressed the reach of countless images featuring women’s bodies, and hurt female-led businesses – further amplifying social disparities.

As one computer science expert we spoke to put it: ‘this is just wild’.

Nichols, 29, was a lot of things: a father, photographer, lover of sunsets and a skater.

And for Black skaters, who are often seen as outsiders in a world of outsiders, these interactions can be particularly fraught.

"Did you choose to watch the footage that was published of Tyre Nichols fatal beating by a group of Memphis police officers?

Dr. Riana Elyse Anderson decided not to watch the video because she wanted “to preserve her mental health.”

She’s an expert in racial trauma and explains that watching police brutality videos can trigger PTSD-like trauma for Black viewers.

Research shows that exposure to frequent violence against people that look like you causes negative stress reactions, this is called vicarious trauma. Even though you aren’t directly experiencing the violence, watching the disturbing video secondhand can still trigger a trauma response.

This was something that Dr. Anderson experienced in 2016, after watching a video showing the fatal shooting of Philando Castile, a Black Minnesota motorist, by a police officer left her so traumatised that she was left in a catatonic state, unable to move for 45 minutes.

At times like this, watching viral violent videos of police brutality might feel unavoidable - but Dr Anderson encourages you to not feel pressured by anyone else to view certain footage.

"Soaring inflation, climate-driven disasters and war – to name a few current crisis – inflicted untold hardship on hundreds of millions of people across the world in 2022.

At the same time, on an unprecedented scale, the year was the most lucrative for the fossil fuel industry; the five largest western oil and gas companies alone made a combined $200bn in profits.

Shell recently announced a record annual profit of $40bn (£33bn), driven by the high energy prices resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine.

As @greenpeaceuk pointed out on Twitter, even by earning £40,000 per day, every day for the past 2026 years (roughly how long ago Jesus is said to have been born), you would earn £29.6bn.

Shell has suffered a flurry of recent legal and regulatory challenges, which includes a Dutch court order to cut emissions from its oil and gas by 45% by 2030. Shell is appealing the verdict.

Today it's been revealed that the directors of the oil giant Shell are being personally sued over their climate strategy, which the claimants say is inadequate to meet climate targets and puts the company at risk as the world switches to clean energy.

Environmental lawyers ClientEarth have filed the lawsuit against the 11 directors at the high court in England. It is the first case in the world seeking to hold corporate directors liable for failing to properly prepare their company for the net zero transition, ClientEarth said.

“Shell may be making record profits now, but the writing is on the wall for fossil fuels long term,” said ClientEarth lawyer Paul Benson.

A Shell spokesperson said: “We do not accept ClientEarth’s allegations. Our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the company. We believe our climate targets are aligned with the more ambitious [1.5C] goal of the Paris agreement ...""

"“Because of you, 222 children have gone missing from government facilities.”

This is what activist Alaska Harrison said when immigration minister Robert Jenrick tried to speak at a Conservative party fundraiser in London.

The 10 social justice activists from Green New Deal Rising, an organisation that campaigns for climate and social justice, posed as Tory loyalists and demanded to know what happened to asylum-seeking children who have gone missing from hotels.

More activists popped up from the audience variously accusing the government of acting inhumanely and also failing victims of the Windrush scandal. One activist called on both the home secretary, Suella Braverman, and Jenrick to resign immediately.

Fatima Ibrahim, co-director of Green New Deal Rising, said: ‘Those who stand for justice stand against this government and the rhetoric and actions they use to demonise people who are simply seeking safety. We believe it is the responsibility of our government to provide safety for people facing impossible situations.”

A source close to Jenrick said: “Last night the minister spoke about and fielded questions on a wide range of issues including the contribution of the Windrush generation and asylum-seeking children. It is a shame that these individuals refused to engage in a grown up conversation.”

A man, his son and daughter were pulled out from beneath the rubble on Wednesday where they had been stuck for two days after the catastrophic earthquake.

The combined death toll from Monday’s quake which struck Syria and Turkey has now reached 11,416, as rescue efforts continued across the region, despite being hampered by cold weather conditions.

The World Health Organization has warned that up to 23 million people may be affected by the quakes. Many countries have so far pledged aid, and international rescue teams have begun to arrive. For those in the stricken areas, help could not come soon enough.

Authorities have said about 13.5 million people have been affected in Turkey. Aid officials were particularly alarmed, however, by the situation in Syria, already devastated by 11 years of a civil war that has hugely complicating relief efforts.

"Warning: the following post contains graphic descriptions of sexual violence

The serial rapist and former Metropolitan police officer David Carrick has been sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.

He used his status as a Metropolitan police officer to commit 48 rapes amid a spree of 85 serious offences against 12 women.

Sentencing him at Southwark crown court this afternoon, Mrs Justice Cheema Grubb told Carrick he would serve a total of 36 life sentences, with 30 years and 209 days to be served before the parole board can consider releasing him. She declined to impose a whole-life order, saying the threshold had not been met.

The 48-year-old’s offending was so prolific that he is one of the worst sex offenders in modern British legal history and the scandal has rocked the Met, which missed the rapist in their ranks despite repeated complaints against him.

Most of Carrick’s crimes took place in Hertfordshire and was against women he met socially or on dating apps, or with whom he had a longer-term relationship.

In their statements, his victims spoke of how they had “encountered evil”, and the court was told Carrick sent one of his victims a photograph of himself with a work-issue gun, saying: “Remember I am the boss.”

The criminal investigation will continue even after he begins his prison sentence, with detectives fearing there are more victims who did not come forward to be part of the case they built against Carrick.

"At least 1,200 people have been killed as they slept in Turkey and Syria after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit in the early hours of Monday morning, in one of the most powerful quakes in the region in at least a century.

Thousands more were injured as the quake wiped out entire sections of major cities in a region filled with millions of people who have fled the civil war in Syria and other conflicts.

Television images showed shocked people in Turkey standing in the snow in their pyjamas, watching rescuers dig through the debris of damaged homes. Buildings were levelled while many people were still asleep.

The number of confirmed casualties rose rapidly on Monday morning as rescue teams rushed to find survivors. Tremors were felt as far away as Lebanon, Greece, Israel and the island of Cyprus.

The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, the biggest humanitarian organisation in Turkey and part of the International Red Cross, said it was mobilising resources for the region and urged people to evacuate damaged homes.

The Syrian Civil Defence, a rescue service known as the White Helmets that works to save those trapped under debris from airstrikes, said they had declared a state of emergency to rescue the many people feared trapped under collapsed buildings in areas around Idlib across opposition-held areas in north-western Syria.

In a statement, the organisation described “a catastrophic situation with buildings collapsed or suffering major cracks, hundreds injured and stranded, dozens dead and a lack of services as well as safe shelters and assembly points in stormy and snowy weather conditions and low temperatures”.

The group also added a plea for aid from the international community “to prevent the situation from worsening” and to pressure both the Syrian government and their backers in Moscow to hold back on airstrikes in the area to prevent further tragedy.

"How many people do you share a Netflix password with?

The world of password sharing on the streaming service is soon to be history, and the company yesterday accidentally posted guidelines for how they would be cracking down on the practice.

Netflix said the mistakenly launched guidelines are being trialled in Chile, Peru and Costa Rica had been posted accidentally across its help centre pages including in the US on Wednesday, but had since been taken down.

Since last year Netflix has been trialling “paid sharing” in the three countries where an account holder pays for an extra person, located outside the account holder’s home, to access the service. In Costa Rica the fee is $2.99 (£2.44) a month.

To ensure that a Netflix account is not being shared outside of the household where it is registered, the trial requires users to connect their viewing device – such as a TV, mobile phone or tablet – to the wifi in their home, open the Netflix app and watch something on the streaming service at least once every 31 days.

Although Netflix has yet to unveil its plans to tackle account sharing worldwide, the trial is the closest indication to what a global approach might look like.

Netflix, which has 230 million subscribers worldwide, said last month that account sharing “undermines our long-term ability to invest in and improve Netflix”.

However as one Twitter user pointed out, they haven't always thought this. Netflix tweeted in 2017 that 'love is sharing a password'. Swipe for more of what a few users had to say on Twitter.

"“These obscene profits are an insult to working families ... as households up and down Britain struggle to pay their bills and make ends meet, Shell are enjoying a cash bonanza.""

This was said by Paul Nowak, the general secretary of the TUC after Shell reported one of the largest profits in UK corporate history, with the surge in energy prices sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushing the oil company’s annual takings to $40bn (£32bn).

Opposition parties and trade unions described Shell’s bonanza, the biggest in its 115 year history, as “outrageous” and accused Rishi Sunak of letting fossil fuel companies “off the hook”.

On Thursday, the UK headquartered company confirmed it had paid just $134m in British windfall taxes during 2022. It paid $520m under the EU “solidarity contribution” – Europe’s equivalent of the windfall tax.

The company was criticised in October when it said it had paid no UK windfall tax up to that point, but on Wednesday said it was likely to contribute $500m in 2023.

Shell has benefited from a surge in oil prices caused by embargoes on Russian oil imposed since the invasion of Ukraine, and Vladimir Putin's decision to cut off gas supplies to continental Europe.

Sunak’s spokesperson said No 10 was aware the public would view Shell’s profits as “extraordinarily” high, which was why the government had introduced its windfall tax comparable to those seen in other countries, he added.

That's how much public money has already been spent to fund Boris Johnson's legal defence for the inquiry into his Partygate denails.

According to our new exclusive report, officials at the government’s spending watchdog are examining the controversial decision to provide these taxpayer funds, and has yet to decide whether to mount a formal investigation.

On top of the six-figure budget already established, sources have also indicated more money could be set aside to cover the former prime minister’s legal advice, given the privileges committee’s investigation could drag on into next month.

The revelations came as Johnson issued a fresh defence of his actions as PM during lockdown, insisting: “I thought what we were doing was within the rules.”

Keir Starmer laid into Johnson for relying on taxpayers to foot the bill incurred during a long-running investigation into whether he misled parliament by denying any Covid rules were broken in No 10, before swathes of fines for illegal parties were handed out.

The Labour leader said he “couldn’t quite believe it” and urged Rishi Sunak at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday to “put his foot down” and tell Johnson that as “he made the mess, he can pick up the bill”.

The Cabinet Office defended the idea of taxpayers footing Johnson’s legal advice costs, saying: “There is an established precedent across multiple administrations that former ministers may be supported with legal representation after they have left office when matters relate to their time and conduct as a minister.”

Protesters have been taking to the streets across the US after police released graphic videos of Nichols’ fatal beating.

Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, died on 10 January several days after an encounter with a group of Tennessee police officers during a traffic stop near his mother’s house.

"“I was just trying to go home” 

This is what Tyre Nichols was heard pleading to police officers before his killing. 

Described as “a momma’s boy” by his mother, RowVaughn Wells, the 29-year-old Memphis, Tennessee, resident, the youngest of four children, was also a father himself. He leaves a four-year-old boy whom he loved to teach skateboarding.

⚠️ A warning: this caption contains details of graphic violence.

A group of Tennessee police officers punched and kicked Tyre Nichols – delivering at least a half-dozen blows – as he languished on the ground, crying out for his mother, during a 7 January beating that would result in his death, surveillance footage released Friday night revealed. 

The deadly attack on Nichols reportedly unfolded about 80 yards from his mother’s home.

The disturbing video, which was released in four parts by the Memphis police department, included both body-camera and street lamp-mounted camera video. 

While Nichols’s injuries were clearly severe, and his physical condition in obvious decline, the video indicates that an ambulance did not arrive for more than 20min after the vicious beatdown.

Some of the chaotic footage shows officers punching and kicking Nichols. One officer shouted that he would “baton the fuck outta you”.

Video from the camera attached to a light pole provided the broadest – and most wrenching – view of the beating. As Nichols, who appeared cuffed, remained on the ground, one officer kicked him in the head and then did so again.

We have decided not to show the footage here, but if you would want to better understand the chronology of the fatal encounter - and chose to view video - we have put together a report via the link in our bio.

"Have you heard of Andrew Tate?

Many adults are only now hearing about the former reality TV star.

Tate is known for making misogynistic statements online to his millions of followers. Last month, he was arrested with his brother, Tristan, as part of an investigation into human trafficking, rape, and organised crime. Both men have denied wrongdoing.

Worryingly, schools across the country are saying that Tate is already a hugely familiar figure to many of their pupils - and his dangerous language has spread to the classrooms.

“Girls had noticed a difference in how boys were speaking to them, they felt it was the Andrew Tate influence,” said teacher Charlotte Carson.
She says that many schools are trying to tackle the problem by encouraging students to question the content he puts out and spend less time online - but told us that she thinks more needs to be done at home.

“Parents need to have conversations with kids about what they are watching on TikTok,” she says.

"The occupied West Bank has seen its deadliest single day in years after Israeli forces conducted a raid in which nine Palestinians were killed.

Israel said soldiers conducted the unusual daytime operation at the Jenin refugee camp because of intelligence suggesting a cell linked to Palestinian Islamic Jihad was planning to carry out imminent attacks against Israelis.

A 61-year-old woman and a male civilian were among the dead, the Palestinian health ministry said, and about 20 more people were seriously injured in the violence.

Two of the casualties were claimed by the militant group Palestinian Islamic Jihad, another four by Hamas, and one by the armed wing of the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas’ Fatah faction.

Thursday’s bloodshed in Jenin is the latest development in Operation Breakwater, a nine-month-old Israeli military campaign, launched in response to a wave of Palestinian terrorist attacks last spring.

UN and Arab mediators have said that negotiations were being held with Israel and Palestinian factions across the West Bank and Gaza Strip in an effort to calm the situation.

"“Do I have to get on my knees?”

More than 6,500 Russian military personnel have sought to surrender through a special “I want to live” hotline, Ukraine’s government has claimed.

The hotline, fielded by 10 operators, was established after Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a mobilisation of 300,000 civilians with previous military experience to join the Russian war effort.

“During the liberation of Kherson, we had calls from Russians and they told us: ‘Just save our souls because we got stuck somewhere in the mud, our battalion is totally crashed, we have 10 soldiers left, please take us from this mess.'"", said Vitaly Matvienko, spokesperson at the department for prisoners of war.

"“We get a glimpse out of the window with queues of ambulances, a collapsing NHS, striking workers and signs to food banks … as these three characters sit inside, insulated from the hardship outdoors”.

This is how cartoonist Ben Jennings described his latest image capturing the UK government overseeing a country in turmoil, led by high profile figures beset by blunders and financial controversies.

On Friday, the Guardian revealed the current cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi resolved a multimillion-pound tax dispute with His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs by paying a seven-figure penalty during his short time as chancellor - when he was responsible for Britain’s tax affairs and tax collection. Zahawi says his mistakes were “careless”, but ""not deliberate"".

Meanwhile, the current prime minister Rishi Sunak recently received a fine for not wearing a seatbelt while filming a video – and it has been alleged that the BBC chair helped the former prime minister Boris Johnson arrange a guarantee on a loan of up to £800,000 weeks before he was recommended for the job by the then PM.

"Does it surprise you that it’s more dangerous to be a journalist in Latin America and the Caribbean than in a war zone?

In a new report, the press watchdog Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said that, globally, at least 67 journalists and media workers had been killed in 2022 - nearly double the 2021 figure of 45.

“Covering these beats is becoming extremely dangerous,” said the CPJ’s New York-based programme director, Carlos Martínez de la Serna.

Serna warns that the killing of journalists will continue unless the governments take radically different approaches to protect them.

"“What the regime has done with these executions is create a fire under the ashes”

This is what the friend of one protester in Iran, who is currently on death row, told our reporter Deepa Parent.

It has been more than four months since the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini at the hands of Iran’s “morality police” sparked waves of protests across the country.

But now, after mass arrests, the Iranian regime has begun executing people connected to the demonstrations after conducting what the UN human rights office has described as “unfair trials based on forced confessions”.

Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer and human rights activist in Iran, said due process had not been allowed, turning the executions into “open murder”.

Four men are known to have been executed after receiving trials that sources say lasted no longer than 15 minutes.

The Iranian foreign ministry has rejected criticism of the judicial process, saying: “Remarks of self-styled defenders of human rights are replete with racist thoughts.”

As concern grows for those demanding change in Iran, this video explains what we know about the executions so far – and how they have affected the protest movement.

"Two hundred asylum-seeking children who were placed in hotels run by the Home Office have gone missing, a minister has admitted.

They include one girl and at least 13 children under the age of 16, Simon Murray told the House of Lords yesterday.

It comes after the Observer reported a story that seemed to set a new low for the authorities’ handling of asylum seekers who come to the UK by small boats: dozens of vulnerable children, with no parent in the country, being abducted from outside Home Office-run hotels and disappearing, according to a whistleblower from a Home Office hotel in Brighton.

And yet that summary only scratches the surface of the policy mess that has left them so at risk.

At one hotel alone, 79 children are still unaccounted for.

In many cases, they may have been picked up by criminal gangs, perhaps having been told that they will be sent to Rwanda if they stay.

And yet there is no timeline in places for ending the practice of putting children up in hotels, a temporary policy created to deal with an emergency that has become the norm.

A Home Office spokesperson told us: “The wellbeing of children in our care is an absolute priority. Robust safeguarding procedures are in place to ensure all children and minors in care are as safe and supported as possible as we seek urgent placements with a local authority ...""

"Exclusive: Nick Markham, a Conservative health minister who was given a peerage by Liz Truss, has a substantial financial stake in a private health screening and Covid testing firm, the Guardian can reveal.

Markham, a businessman who was appointed to the health department, owns about 30% of Cignpost Investments and has done so throughout his first four months in the job, raising questions about the potential for a conflict of interest.

The company was set up during the pandemic to provide Covid testing and health screening services to the private sector.

Markham’s biography for the Department for Health website makes no mention of his private health sector interest, despite describing his previous private sector jobs at ITV and TopUp TV and as the founder of a charity.

He was made a health minister in September and declared the Cignpost investment on his register of interests in the House of Lords.

The Department of Health and Social Care had no comment when asked what was being done to mitigate the risks of a conflict of interest.

However, it is understood that Markham has told the department that he is now in the process of divesting his shareholding. He resigned as a director when he became a minister in September.

Angela Rayner, Labour deputy leader and shadow chancellor of the duchy
of Lancaster said: ""Conservative cronies have been rewarded with peerages and plum ministerial jobs while maintaining lucrative interests. There is a rotten stench about the revolving door the Tories have left wide open.""

"A march billed as the 'takeover of Lima' escalated into running battles between protesters and riot police amid stone-throwing and swirls of teargas on Thursday evening in Peru’s capital.

Thousands of protesters from across the country poured into Lima earlier in the week to take part in a huge march demanding the resignation of President Dina Boluarte after nearly six weeks of turmoil that has killed more than 50 people.

Outrage over the rising death toll has powered the mounting protests, which began in early December in support of then-president Pedro Castillo who was ousted from office. Boluarte was Castillo’s vice-president and replaced him after he attempted to shutter Congress and rule by decree on 7 December.

The demonstrations have now shifted overwhelmingly to demand Boluarte resign, the closure of Congress and fresh elections.

"She's been dubbed ""Toadzilla"" – this giant cane toad – found by rangers in Queensland’s Conway national park on Thursday – is believed to be the largest of her species ever discovered tipping the scales at 2.7kg.

“A cane toad that size will eat anything it can fit into its mouth, and that includes insects, reptiles and small mammals,” says Kylee Gray, the ranger who found her.

“The Queensland Museum is interested in taking her, as she might be the largest on record ... She was found at an elevation of 393 metres, which isn’t unusual, but she has created a lot of interest among our ranger staff due to her size,” she added.

“We dubbed it Toadzilla, and quickly put it into a container so we could remove it from the wild.”

Cane toads are one of Australia’s most notorious invasive species and are considered a threat to native wildlife. They have colonised a wide variety of habitats across north-eastern Australia after they were introduced into Queensland in 1935 to control the cane beetle.

"“The Scottish government is just trying to make it fairer, quicker, and more humane for trans people to change their legal gender,” says Harry Nicholas, who legally changed his gender in 2022 by applying for a gender recognition certificate GRC. 

He decided to get one so he could marry his boyfriend as his true gender - but the reasons why trans people apply for a GRC differ from person to person.

Currently, to change the gender marker on their birth certificate, a trans person in the UK must have a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria and proof that they’ve lived as their true gender for two years.

The Scottish government was trying to pass a law that would simplify and speed up this process by removing the need for a diagnosis and lowering the age limit to 16, as Nicola Sturgeon’s government believes the current process is too difficult and invasive.

But this was stopped by the UK government which has - for the first time ever - blocked a Scottish law change. How?

Under section 35 of the Scotland Act, a UK secretary of state can stop a bill from getting royal assent if they have reasonable grounds to believe the law in question would have an adverse effect on legislation reserved to Westminster.

In this case, it was the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, claiming the gender recognition bill would impede operation of the UK Equality Act.

But Sturgeon has argued there are no grounds for the UK government to challenge the legislation as it falls within the powers of the Scottish Parliament.

She has said any move to block the reforms would be using trans people “as a political weapon”.

"As the 'world’s elite' descend on the small Swiss town of Davos this week for forums aiming to solve “the biggest issues facing our world"", the charity Oxfam have released a report revealing the extreme gap between the world’s wealthiest and poorest people.

The charity said the best-off had pocketed $26tn (£21tn) in new wealth up from the start 2020 to the end of 2021. That represented 63% of the total new wealth, with the rest going to the remaining 99% of people.

The report calls for immediate action to tackle widening global inequality after revealing that while poverty has increased for the first time in 25 years, the combined fortune of billionaires has increased by $2.7bn a day.

“The current economic reality is an affront to basic human values”, says Danny Sriskandarajah, the chief executive of Oxfam GB.

“How can we accept a system where the poorest people in many countries pay much higher tax rates than the super-rich? Governments must introduce higher taxes on the super-rich now.""

One of the richest men in history, Elon Musk, has been shown to pay a ‘true tax rate’ of 3.2%, while another of the richest billionaires, Jeff Bezos, pays less than 1%, the report says.

Oxfam said extreme concentrations of wealth led to weaker growth, corrupted politics and the media, corroded democracy and led to political polarisation.

The super-rich were key contributors to the climate crisis, the charity added, with a billionaire emitting a million times more carbon than the average person.

“Taxing the wealthiest is no longer an option – it’s a must"" said Colombia’s finance minister, José Antonio Ocampo in a foreword to the report.

"Ukraine has denied a claim by the Russian defence ministry that its forces had taken the town of Soledar, which has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the war.

“The statements of the Russian MoD about the capture … are not true. There are battles in Soledar,” said Serhiy Cherevaty, spokesman for the Eastern group of the Ukrainian army.

Andriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s presidential office, described the situation in Bakhmut and Soledar as the “battle of Verdun in the 21st century”, referring to the longest battle of the first world war which led to huge casualties.

“The Russians release criminals from prisons who die as soon as they reach the front line. Their bodies are left in place,” he said.

“But before us is a human mass that is constantly attacking, attacking, attacking. Soledar is a place of street battles … The Russians are there, but they do not control the city. The situation is complicated, but our goal is to liberate our territories [and] fully restore the territorial integrity of Ukraine.”

Moscow is hoping to turn the tide on half a year of humiliating retreats in Ukraine.

"“We now have the smoking gun showing that they accurately predicted warming years before they started attacking the science,"" said Geoffrey Supran who led the new analysis of the oil company.

The oil giant Exxon privately “predicted global warming correctly and skilfully” only to then spend decades publicly rubbishing such science in order to protect its core business, new research has found.

A new study has made clear that Exxon’s scientists were uncannily accurate in their projections from the 1970s onwards, predicting an upward curve of global temperatures and carbon dioxide emissions that is close to matching what actually occurred as the world heated up at a pace not seen in millions of years.

Armed with this knowledge, Exxon embarked upon a lengthy campaign to downplay or discredit what its own scientists had confirmed.

“What they did was essentially remain silent while doing this work and only when it became strategically necessary to manage the existential threat to their business did they stand up and speak out against the science,” said Supran.

“They could have endorsed their science rather than deny it. It would have been a much harder case to deny it if the king of big oil was actually backing the science rather than attacking it,"" he continued.

A spokesperson for Exxon said: “This issue has come up several times in recent years and, in each case, our answer is the same: those who talk about how “Exxon Knew” are wrong in their conclusions. In 2019, Judge Barry Ostrager of the NY State Supreme Court listened to all the facts in a related case before him and wrote: “What the evidence at trial revealed is that ExxonMobil executives and employees were uniformly committed to rigorously discharging their duties in the most comprehensive and meticulous manner possible... The testimony of these witnesses demonstrated that ExxonMobil has a culture of disciplined analysis, planning, accounting, and reporting.”

"Newly obtained body-camera video shows heavily armed Florida police officers descending on the homes of two men accused of illegally voting, as part of the governor, Ron DeSantis’s, crackdown on voter fraud.

Ronald Lee Miller and Robert Lee Wood were in their underwear, unarmed, and placed in handcuffs as police arrested them in front of their Miami-Dade county homes on 18 August 2022.

The Guardian obtained video of both arrests through public records requests with the Miami-Dade police department, which assisted with executing warrants for both men.

The voter fraud charges against them were separately dismissed.

The videos add to mounting scrutiny over the arrests of 19 Floridians in August, including Miller and Wood, who were accused of voter fraud. These arrests were part of the first wave brought by the office of election crimes and security, a new state agency focused on investigating voter fraud. Hours after the men were arrested, DeSantis held a press conference saying those accused of voter fraud would ""pay the price"".

Miller’s attorney, Robert Barrar, described the video of his client’s arrest as “abominable”.

“I think they’re trying to make an example of him because he’s Black. It’s horrible”, he said.

Riot police have entered the abandoned village of Lützerath, in western Germany, where hundreds of climate activists barricaded themselves on Wednesday in a showdown that has highlighted tensions around Germany's climate policy during an energy crisis.

Anti-coal demonstrators have occupied Lützerath, in North Rhine Westphalia, for more than two years. The village is due to be bulldozed to expand the nearby Garzweiler coalmine.

About 700 demonstrators occupying the deserted village clashed with officers after eviction orders were issued by a local court.

The environmental activists say that expanding the coalmine would result in huge greenhouse gas emissions. The government and utility company RWE say the coal is needed to ensure Germany’s energy security.

"“We need to be nicer to mother nature.”

That’s what TV host and Californian resident Ellen DeGeneres said in a video she posted about the deadly storms that have hit the US state.
A barrage of extreme weather has caused destruction since late December, with the latest storm hitting in recent days and more on the horizon.

Heavy rainfall and winds have continued putting entire communities under flood warnings and evacuation orders, knocking out power to tens of thousands and causing hillsides to collapse.

Authorities confirmed that at least 17 people have been killed in the storm and the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said that figure was “likely to grow”.

"“What we are witnessing is a terrorist attack,” the news anchor Erick Bang announced on the GloboNews television.

Thousands of supporters of Brazil’s far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro invaded the country’s congress, presidential palace and supreme court on Sunday, in a grim echo of the US Capitol invasion two years ago by backers of former president Donald Trump.

Shocking video footage showed pro-Bolsonaro militants sprinting up the ramp into the Palácio do Planalto, the presidential offices, roaming the building’s corridors and vandalising the nearby supreme court, whose windows had been smashed.

Videos posted on social media showed fires burning inside the congress building. Furniture was broken and tossed around, objects were reportedly stolen in the presidential palace and the supreme court, and in some places sprinklers appeared to be dousing chambers.

“They are throwing chairs out of the windows,” said another bewildered GloboNews commentator, Eliane Cantanhêde. “They are destroying public buildings.”

Lula, a veteran leftist, was sworn in as Brazil’s new president last Sunday in celebrations attended by hundreds of thousands of Brazilians.

But thousands of pro-Bolsonaro extremists have refused to accept Lula’s narrow victory in October’s election, spending recent weeks camping outside army bases across the country and calling for a military coup.

Although unbelievably popular and successful while in office, Lula was imprisoned on corruption charges in 2017. These charges were later annulled by the Supreme Court, and he was free to run for president again in the 2022 election.

"These two images show Alaska's Northwestern Glacier melting over a 60 to 80 year period. The Glacier retreated around six miles from when the first image was taken between the 1920s-40s, and 2005.

This trend is only set to accelerate. According to new research, half the planet’s glaciers will have melted by 2100, even if humanity sticks to goals set out in the Paris climate agreement. The scale and impacts of glacial loss are greater than previously thought, and at least half of that loss will happen in the next 30 years.

Researchers found 49% of glaciers would disappear under the most optimistic scenario of 1.5C of warming. However, if global heating continued under the current scenario of 2.7C of warming, losses would be more significant, with 68% of glaciers disappearing, according to the paper, published in Science. The study looked at all glacial land ice except for Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

This will significantly contribute to sea level rise, threaten the supply of water to up to 2 billion people, and increase the risk of natural hazards such as flooding.

If temperature increases are limited to 1.5C of warming, average sea levels would increase by 90mm (3.5in) from 2015 to 2100, but with 2.7C of warming, glacial melt would lead to around 115mm of sea level rise. These scenarios are up to 23% more than previous models had estimated.

Mountain glacier melt is believed to contribute to more than a third of sea level rise. A lot of this loss is unavoidable, but the magnitude of loss is directly related to temperature increases, so acting on the climate crisis is key.

“The rapidly increasing glacier mass losses as global temperature increases beyond 1.5C stresses the urgency of establishing more ambitious climate pledges to preserve the glaciers in these mountainous regions,"" researchers wrote.

"“It’s been a real mess – they’re shooting up in the air trying to bring down the [police] helicopters. The whole town is a mess.”

This is how a resident in the Mexican city of Culiacán described the deadly riot that erupted in response to the arrest of El Chapo’s son.

Mexican authorities have recaptured Ovidio Guzmán, a son of the incarcerated drugs kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. This has prompted a wave of retaliatory attacks from cartel gunmen in the northern city of Culiacán.

According to one resident, heavy fighting raged for hours after Guzmán – a key figure in the Sinaloa cartel since the arrest of his father – was arrested in the city early on Thursday.

“They caught him at about 4am, and since then the shooting hasn’t stopped,” the resident said.

The Sinaloa state government said three members of the security forces had been killed in the clashes,18 people admitted to hospital, two planes were hit by gunfire and more than 100 flights were cancelled.

Guzmán-López is accused of leading a part of his father’s notorious Sinaloa cartel and is wanted by the US on drug trafficking charges.

His father, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, is serving a life sentence in the US after being found guilty in 2019 of drug trafficking and money laundering.

"Russia has acknowledged its worst military losses since the war in Ukraine began, in an attack on New Year’s Eve.

Officials say 89 servicemen were killed in Makiivka, eastern Ukraine.

But the real death toll is still unknown as Ukrainian officials claim that almost 400 soldiers were killed and 300 injured in the strike.

The deaths of Russian conscripts in Makiivka sparked heavy criticism from pro-war Russians.

Russian military correspondents, who have gained influence in recent months, said hundreds could have been killed and accused Russia’s commanders of incompetence.

Vladimir Putin has not yet reacted to the Makiivka strike, which came during the holiday season before Orthodox Christmas, which many Russians spend with their families.

"By the time you are reading this, the bosses of Britain’s biggest companies have made more money than the average UK worker will in the entire year, according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else in the country.

The High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, said that by 2pm on Thursday, the third working day of 2023, a FTSE 100 chief executive will have been paid more on an hourly basis than the UK worker’s annual salary, based on median average remuneration figures for both groups.

According to analysis by the GMB trade union, it would take a 999 ambulance call handler almost 150 years to match the pay of the average chief executive. “It’s an utter disgrace,” said Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, which represents ambulance workers set to go on strike next week. “NHS workers and others are being forced on to the picket lines just to make ends meet while these fat cats get the cream.”

FTSE 100 chief executives are paid £3.4m on average, which works out at 103 times the £33,000 average salary for full-time UK workers, according to Office for National Statistics figures.

The highest-paid FTSE 100 CEO, according to the research, was Sébastien de Montessus, of Endeavour, which operates goldmines in Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso and Senegal. He was paid £16.9m, including an £8m “one-off award” when the firm relocated from Toronto to London.

The second highest-paid boss was Pascal Soriot, of AstraZeneca, who was paid £13.9m.

Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, said: “In the worst economic circumstances that most people can remember, it is difficult to believe that a handful of top earners are still raking in such extraordinary amounts of money.

“The UK economy really cannot afford for such a big share of the wealth that is created by all workers to be captured by such a tiny number of people at the top. To address declining living standards for the majority, we need measures to balance the distribution of incomes more evenly.”

The confrontation escalated, Harry writes, until William “grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and … knocked me to the floor”.

"Have you heard of Manx Gaelic?

It's the rarest language in England and Wales according to the latest census - so you'll be forgiven if you haven't...

But if you take a trip to the Isle of Man, which is located in the Irish Sea between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, you're far more likely to have heard it, because this is where Manx Gaelic originates.

For centuries, Manx, which is part of the Celtic language family like Irish and Scottish Gaelic, was how people on the island communicated.

By the 19th century however, the English language took over - and by 2009 Unesco declared it extinct, which was soon corrected to ‘critically endangered’ after outcry from the Manx language community.

Because the Isle of Man is not part of the UK – but is a self-governing crown dependency with its own parliament, government and laws – it has its own census.

And Manx is continuing to grow in popularity year on year, with over 120 years of support from the community, and residents on the island are using music, schooling, and the internet to bring back their ancestors’ mother tongue.

We spoke to Ruth Keggin Gell from Culture Vannin. She teaches Manx and is a part of the movement keeping Manx alive.

"UPDATE: Since this was posted, two additional mass shootings occurred in 2022 in the US, bringing the total for the year up to 648.

A mass shooting, according to the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), is when four or more people are shot in a single event, at the same general time and location, not including the shooter. 

This took place 646 times in the US over the past year, and resulted in 671 people dying.

It’s rare to go one day without a mass shooting in America.

Since 2014 the US has averaged more than one mass shooting a day, according the GVA, a non-profit that tracks gun violence incidents across the country.

2022 is the second-highest year for mass shootings in the United States on record since the group began tracking them in 2014. It is surpassed by 2021, when 690 shootings took place.

"Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who served as leader of the Catholic church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, has died aged 95, the Vatican has announced.

A statement from Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said: “With sorrow, I inform you that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI passed away today at 9.34 in the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican. Further information will be provided as soon as possible.”

Benedict will be remembered as the first pope in 600 years to retire, rather than die in office. His sudden resignation in 2013 left the church reeling and began an unprecedented period in which two popes co-existed.

Benedict, formerly a German cardinal, was a theological conservative, holding uncompromising positions on homosexuality and contraception.

During his tenure, allegations of clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up began to surface. His critics said he failed to grasp the gravity of the crimes and the scale of the crisis, which reached a peak several years after he was elected pope in April 2005.

As well as the flood of allegations, lawsuits and official reports relating to sexual abuse and the priests’ complicity in covering it up, the Vatican was also rocked by the theft of confidential documents, many of which later appeared in an exposé of alleged corruption.

Upon his retirement, Benedict pledged to devote his life to private prayer, but he remained a powerful conservative influence and a focus for opponents of successor, Pope Francis, and his efforts to reform the church.

In April 2019, two months after Francis convened a groundbreaking Vatican conference on sexual abuse, Benedict published a 6,000-word letter saying abuse was a product of a culture of sexual freedom dating from the 1960s.

His death paves the way for Francis, to consider whether to follow Benedict by retiring at some point – impossible while the outcome would have been three popes.

"UPDATE: Romanian authorities have confirmed the pizza box featured in Andrew Tate’s video, posted prior to his arrest, did not lead police officers to his location.

The controversial online influencer and self-described misogynist was detained in Romania on charges of human trafficking, rape and forming an organised crime group.

After his arrest, local media reported that prosecutors mobilised law enforcement only after seeing the Tates were together from “social media”.

This led to online speculation and subsequent news reports that the brand of pizza featured in a video that Tate posted to his Twitter account helped police to confirm his presence in Romania.

However, the anti-organised crime unit representative said that it was not the case that Tate’s arrest had been made as a result of the pizza boxes.

The former kickboxer and reality TV star was arrested alongside his brother and two other suspects.

Over the past week, he had been engaged in a Twitter standoff with the climate activist Greta Thunberg, attempting to troll her by telling her about his large collection of emission-heavy cars. Thunberg responded by implying Tate had “small-dick energy”.

She used her public profile to champion issues including nuclear disarmament and the fight against climate change, often bringing the causes she cared about to the runway.

"“My daughter is a survivor, but she shouldn’t have to be; hair discrimination has no place in our schools or workplaces,” says Kate Williams, whose daughter Ruby was left “hurt and humiliated” when her school tried to police how her natural afro hair should look.

In October, in a huge milestone, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) issued new guidance to schools to warn them that appearance policies that ban certain hairstyles, including “natural Afro hairstyles, braids, cornrows, plaits and head coverings”, without allowing for exceptions on racial and religious grounds, are likely to be unlawful.

But Ruby’s was one of several high-profile cases in recent years that should have caused schools to stop and think about their hair policies long before this, says Kate. Swipe to read more.

"Which of these figures do you think is the most shocking?

Christmas staples such as turkey, potatoes and carrots have increased in price by an average of nearly 20% over the last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This is three times faster than wages have risen, according to research from the Trades Union Congress (TUC).

The TUC is calling for ministers to give fully funded, cost of living-proofed pay rises to public sector workers and to raise the minimum wage to £15 an hour “as soon as possible”.

“Christmas should be a time for celebration. But soaring food and energy prices mean many families will struggle to afford the festivities,” Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said earlier this month. “And the fact is, many workers are dreading the new year.”

"A deep freeze enveloped most of the US early today, as cold air plunged south from northern Canada all the way to the Gulf coast. Combined with a massive winter storm brewing in the midwest, two-thirds of the nation is under extreme weather alerts. 

Wind-chill temperatures lower than -40C are expected, the point at which the celsius and fahrenheit scales intersect.

At the White House, after a briefing on the potential “bomb cyclone”, President Joe Biden said last night: “This is not like a snow day when you were a kid. This is serious stuff.” 

A bomb cyclone forms when atmospheric pressure drops very quickly in a strong storm. Forecasters expected that to occur near the Great Lakes, increasing winds and creating blizzard conditions.

Roughly 200 million people across the America are expected to be forced to face the these frigid conditions, posing life-threatening dangers to anyone without shelter from the storms, wreaking havoc on holiday travel plans and possibly straining susceptible power grids.

"""It's like an antidote to despair""

In the midst of the UK's deepening cost of living crisis, our journalists John Harris and John Domokos went in search of hope.

Touring England and Wales they met a new type of community activist: the people dealing with hunger, poverty and loneliness, but who are also trying to push towards a better future.

They spoke to dozens of people about what life has been like for them, including Julia, who has been helping at the Selby Trust, a food hub in Tottenham, north London, since the day it opened.

""This has been going on for too long. We're in poverty – what are you [the government] going to do about it?"" she says.

"The Taliban has reportedly banned girls in Afghanistan from attending primary school in what would amount to a total ban on female education.

On Tuesday, the fundamentalist regime announced that women would be banned from university education indefinitely.

Yesterday, female students who showed up for class wept and consoled each other after they were turned away by security forces, forced to reckon with the loss of their imagined futures – and the further tightening of the same extreme misogynist ideology that the Taliban once promised would not return.

This news follows a series of recent edicts which suggest that the most fundamentalist voices within the Taliban are now dominant.

A number of Afghan civil and women’s rights activists abroad have issued a joint statement calling for the Taliban to reverse “this medieval crime” that will “impose absolute isolation on Afghan women and girls and expose women to violence, poverty and exploitation”.

Zahra Joya used to run Rukhshana Media, a news agency she founded to report on the lives of women and girls in Afghanistan, from a small office in Kabul. Forced to flee after the Taliban seized power last year, she relocated to London.

Yesterday she wrote a piece for the Guardian, speaking to women facing the abrupt end of their education – even if they were close to graduating.

The quote above was written by student Sakina Sama on Facebook. Joya has spoken with more women and girls about their experiences - and it's a heart-wrenching read.

"What do you think is behind this disparity?

Australian women have poorer health, lower incomes and less engagement in the labour force than men, a new report has found.

A health and wellbeing scorecard, published earlier this month, has found that women’s economic equity and health have deteriorated in the past decade.

Led by researchers at the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, the scorecard will annually document progress in health and wellbeing outcomes in Australia over time.

Prof Helena Teede, the MCHRI’s director and a co-author of the report, said the scorecard highlighted the need for urgent structural change.

“Our workforce productivity is so profoundly affected by the very dramatic impact that childcare has in Australia, because we have one of the most expensive childcare systems in the world,” she said. “At the moment in Australia, having a family has pretty much no impact on a man’s income or their career trajectory; it has a very profound impact for women.”

The MCHRI is calling for the establishment of a national institute that focuses on women’s health, wellbeing and equity.

"A powerful congressional committee on Tuesday voted to publicly release Donald Trump’s tax returns in a move that is sure to ignite a political row as well as anger among some privacy experts in America.

The Democratic-controlled House ways and means committee decided to release the documents, which the former US president has long tried to shield, after several hours of debate.

The New York Times previously released extensive chunks of Trump’s tax returns which showed how the real estate mogul and reality TV star had suffered serious losses and engaged in extensive tax avoidance.

The decision by the panel comes after a long battle that ultimately resulted in the supreme court clearing the way last month for the treasury department to send the returns to Congress. The committee received six years of tax returns for Trump and some of his businesses.",2022-12-21 02:56:11

Since then, bombs have torn through thousands of buildings destroying homes and killing civilians and troops.

The official death toll is unknown but since the war broke out in February, the US estimates that there have been 200,000 military casualties on all sides of the war and as many as 40,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed.

"""Nurses are fighting for my life, and for your life, like they have always done. So I will join them on the picket line as they demand the pay rise they deserve.""

Melanie Duddridge has Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia and chronic asthma. She relies on the NHS every day – that’s why she says she is supporting striking nurses across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Today marks the second day of strikes in December, after an initial strike last week, the biggest in the Royal College of Nursing's history.

It meant the cancellation of thousands of outpatient appointments and non-urgent operations.

The RNC has said that low pay is the cause of chronic understaffing that is putting patients at risk and leaves NHS staff overworked.

Ahead of the first strike, Duddridge wrote: ""I know the strikes might affect my care in the weeks to come, but this action is needed to keep patients like me safe. Nurses aren’t just going on strike for themselves, they are striking to preserve the NHS for all of us.""

"""Now you shut up you stupid man"".

This video captures an exchange between British lawmaker, Bob Stewart, and Sayed Alwadaei, a human rights activist who was imprisoned and tortured for taking part in a pro-democracy uprising in Bahrain in 2011.

Alwadaei confronted the Conservative MP outside a reception hosted by the Bahraini embassy on Wednesday about trips he had taken that were paid for by the Bahraini government ahead of its elections.

Stewart replied by telling Alwadaei ‘you’re taking money off my country’.

The politician apologised for his remarks and said the activist had “persistently taunted me by saying I had taken money from Bahrain”.

He said that the remarks were deeply offensive and that he had not taken money from the country. Stewart added that he defended Bahrain because he was stationed there in 1969 and said he had seen the country progress.

Alwadaei, the director of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird), who sought political asylum in the UK in 2012, has complained to the Tory Party after the interaction.

"Breaking: The January 6 committee has referred Donald Trump to the justice department for criminal charges, accusing the former president of fomenting an insurrection and conspiring against the government over his attempt to subvert the outcome of the 2020 election, and the bloody attack on the US Capitol.

“The committee believes that more than sufficient evidence exists for a criminal referral of former President Trump for assisting or aiding and comforting those at the Capitol who engaged in a violent attack on the United States,” congressman Jamie Raskin said as the committee held its final public meeting.

The committee’s referrals approved by its members Monday are the first time in American history that Congress has recommended charges against a former president. It comes after more than a year of investigation by the bipartisan House of Representatives panel tasked with understanding Trump’s plot to stop Joe Biden from taking office.

The referrals are largely a recommendation, but will arrive at a justice department already busy investigating the former president for crimes he may have committed during and after his time in office.

The panel is expected to release a lengthy report into the attack that left five people dead and spawned nearly 1,000 criminal cases.

"A column by TV personality Jeremy Clarkson about the Duchess of Sussex has provoked outcry online, with social media users labelling it “vile”, “horrific” and “abusive”.

Writing for the Sun, Clarkson wrote he loathed Meghan “on a cellular level”. He said he was “dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, ‘Shame!’ and throw lumps of excrement at her”.

Clarkson also wrote: “Everyone who’s my age thinks the same way.”

The comments have drawn widespread condemnation. The comedian John Bishop tweeted that the remarks were a “blatant appeal to incite humiliation and violence on a woman”.

Harry and Meghan recently opened up about life as senior royals in the UK and their decision to step down from their duties in a six-part Netflix docuseries, including about how tabloid coverage impacted their lives.

While Mbappé mesmerised – scoring the first hat-trick in a World Cup final since 1966 –and Argentina goalkeeper Emi Martínez was magnificent – it was Messi’s magic that will go down in history.

This is what one Guardian reader told us about why they're donating to our annual charity appeal.

We are raising money for grassroots charities providing much-needed support services to people struggling at the frontline of the cost of living crisis, via our two charity partners, Citizens Advice UK and Locality.

An incredible £500,000 has been donated already to our appeal by generous Guardian and Observer readers, with many people telling us that to them donating has been an expression of anger and frustration with the government for not enough being done to support families on low incomes.

For some this is also about simple human compassion. “Times are hard and a little kindness is needed,” added one of our readers.

Donations will go to local voluntary organisations working in some of the UK’s most deprived areas, which are providing crisis support ranging from food banks and warm rooms to debt and housing advice and mental health help.

"Eleven days after her father died crossing the Channel, seven-year-old Clara Hussain Hasib learned of his passing.

Hussein Haseeb Ahmed's wife, Afan Talib, was told about her husband's death when she received a phone call from the Iraqi consulate in London while they were in their home in Chamchamal in northern Iraq.

Ahmed, 31, died on 19 November, a week after arriving in the UK following a long journey from Kurdistan and being taken to Manston, a Home Office site where initial checks are carried out on small boat arrivals.

People are only supposed to be held there for 24 hours but Ahmed was there for seven days and is believed to have been held there unlawfully. He is confirmed to have had a diphtheria infection but it is not yet known if that was the cause of his death.

Talib and Clara told the Guardian they could not believe their beloved husband and father was gone and were hoping against hope there had been a mix-up and the man who died was not Ahmed.

The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed there have been at least 50 diphtheria cases this year, 49 of them relating to asylum seekers in Manston in October and November.

Ahmed made the difficult decision to travel to the UK using smugglers because he wanted to go to “the best country in the world for human rights”, something he said was lacking in Kurdistan.

The family were not well off. They rented their home and Ahmed worked at different jobs including as a hospital cleaner and on a market stall. They sold everything to pay the smugglers for Ahmed’s journey – even their mattress, duvet and pillows. Now Afan and Clara are moving between the homes of Afan’s and Ahmed’s parents.

"How would you feel if you were suddenly a year younger?

South Korea has passed laws to scrap its traditional method of counting ages – a shift that will make its citizens either one or two years younger on official documents.

South Koreans are deemed to be a year old when they are born, and a year is added every 1 January. The unusual – and increasingly unpopular – custom means a baby born on New Year’s Eve becomes two years old as soon as the clock strikes midnight.

However, a separate system also exists for conscription purposes or calculating the legal age to drink alcohol and smoke, in which a person’s age is calculated from zero at birth and a year is added on 1 January.

On top of this, for medical and legal documents South Korea uses the international standard of measuring age, where someone is zero at their birth and turns a year older on their birthday.

The confusing array of systems will disappear from June 2023 – at least on official documents.

“The revision is aimed at reducing unnecessary socio-economic costs because legal and social disputes as well as confusion persist due to the different ways of calculating age,” Yoo Sang-bum of the ruling People Power party told parliament.

Jeong Da-eun, a 29-year-old office worker, is happy about the change, and says she has always had to think twice when asked overseas about her age.

“Who wouldn’t welcome getting a year or two younger?” she added.

This is how the mother of Brian Sicknick, who died after a mob of Donald Trump supporters ransacked the US Capitol building, denounced Senior Republicans Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy at an event for the police who defended against the 6 January insurrection - according to a tweet by CNN congressional reporter Daniella Diaz.

During the Congressional Gold Medal award ceremony earlier this week, the January 6 officers and relatives walked straight past the Republican duo, barely looking at them.

McConnell, the Senate minority leader, was caught on video with his hand outstretched, waiting in line for handshakes that never came as senior officers and Sicknick’s parents warmly greeted the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer.

McCarthy, who hopes to become Speaker when Republicans take over the House majority next month, was widely condemned for what analysts said was a pilgrimage to Donald Trump’s Florida resort in the days after the insurrection.

"This is Mohsen Shekari. He is the first person known to have been executed by the Iranian regime in relation to the anti-government protests that have rocked Iran.

He was hanged after being found guilty by a revolutionary court of “waging war against God”. Shekari was accused of blocking a street and wounding a member of the pro-regime Basij militia on 25 September during the early phase of the protests triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini.

Shekari’s uncle Mahmoud Shekari told the Guardian from Denmark that authorities “have started a familiar game to torture his family” by not releasing his body, a complaint that tallies with the experiences of other families of dead protesters.

Tehran has repeatedly blamed foreign enemies for the unrest and accused “terrorists” of killing dozens of security force members. This is in conflict with statements from the UN office of the high commissioner for human rights, which said more than 300 people had been killed so far in the crackdown, including more than 40 children.

Although World Cup organisers have said all along that the tournament shouldn’t involve politics, it seems the ‘Free Palestine’ cause is being embraced by Qataris, people across the Arab world, as well as some visiting football fans.

Encounters between Arab football fans and Israeli journalists have gone viral on social media - along with another clip of England supporters shouting ‘Free Palestine’ during a TV interview also with an Israeli broadcaster.

Though neither Israel nor Palestine are playing in the tournament, support for the latter has featured prominently at the Middle East’s first World Cup, as our international correspondent Michael Safi explains #Qatar2022",2022-12-09 11:39:14
"Russia freed the WNBA star Brittney Griner in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange, with the US releasing the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, American officials said.

The swap, at a time of heightened tensions over Ukraine, achieved a top goal for Joe Biden but carried a heavy price and left behind an American jailed for nearly four years in Russia. 

Paul Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive, has been jailed since December 2018 on espionage charges his family and the US government say are baseless.

The deal, the second such exchange in eight months with Russia, procured the release of the most prominent American detained abroad. Griner is a two-time Olympic gold medalist whose months-long imprisonment on drug charges brought unprecedented attention to the population of wrongful detainees.

Biden’s authorization to release a Russian felon once nicknamed “the Merchant of Death” underscored the escalating pressure that his administration faced to get Griner home, particularly after the recent resolution of her criminal case and her subsequent transfer to a penal colony.

The swap was confirmed by US officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations who were not authorized to publicly discuss the deal before a White House announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.

"“Pedro Castillo was dictator for only two hours”.

This is what Iván Lanegra, secretary-general of the Peruvian NGO Transparencia, tweeted after the country's now ex-president, Pedro Castillo, was removed from office and detained on charges of ""rebellion"".

Castillo was ousted after he announced he would dissolve congress and install a “government of exception” – just hours before he was due to face an impeachment vote.

The former president was subsequently arrested and charged with “breaching constitutional order”. He was accused of an attempted coup and had been seen fleeing the presidential palace.

Some supporters of Castillo clashed with riot police in the country's capital, Lima after the news was announced, while others took to the streets to celebrate the ex-leader's removal from office.

"""The people have spoken""

The Democratic incumbent, Raphael Warnock, has fended off a challenge from Republican Herschel Walker and won the Georgia Senate runoff, securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his party’s majority in the chamber.

One of 12 children born to a father who was also a pastor and a mother who once picked cotton, in his acceptance speech last night Warnock reflected on the unlikelihood of his path to becoming a US senator.

The Associated Press called the race about three-and-a-half hours after polls closed in Georgia, as Warnock led Walker, by approximately 40,000 votes.

Warnock also told the crowd: “After a hard-fought campaign – or should I say campaigns – it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: the people have spoken.”

"The Democratic incumbent, Raphael Warnock, has won the Georgia Senate runoff, securing his first full term and delivering a 51st seat to bolster his party’s majority in the chamber.

The Associated Press called the race about three and a half hours after polls closed in Georgia.

The news came a month after the national midterm elections, when neither Walker or Warnock secured enough support to win outright, thus requiring the runoff race.

The result of the runoff did not determine control of the Senate, as Democrats have already won enough seats to maintain their hold for the next two years.

But Warnock’s victory gives Democrats a crucial 51st seat, allowing them to abandon their current power-sharing agreement with Republicans in the evenly divided chamber. A 51-seat majority will also provide Democrats with some wriggle room when it comes to close committee votes and nomination fights.

Nearly 2 million Georgians cast ballots in the runoff before election day, and those early voters appeared to significantly favor Warnock. Republicans were counting on a strong election day turnout, but Walker’s support on Tuesday was not enough to get him across the line.",2022-12-07 05:37:12
"“Indonesian democracy is dead”

These were the words of lawyer Citra Referandum as she joined a small protest outside the parliament building in Jakarta after Indonesia’s parliament passed new legislation to overhaul the country’s criminal code to outlaw sex outside marriage and curtail free speech.

Newspapers in Australia have labelled the legislation the “Bali bonk ban” as the law will apply to Indonesians and visiting foreigners.

These are six of the most significant parts of the code:

- Sex outside marriage will be punishable by up to a year in jail
- Unmarried couples living together could face six months in prison
- In both cases, charges can be based only on police reports lodged by a spouse, parents or children
- There will also be punishments for insulting the president
- Under the code “women can be punished” for their dress
- And the promotion of contraception and religious blasphemy will be illegal

There are fears the rules could have a severe impact on LGBTQ+ communities in Indonesia, where gay marriage is not acknowledged.

Amidst muted protests this morning, Referandum, the director of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute, said she expected “people’s anger will mount” over what is seen as a dramatic setback to freedoms in the world’s third-largest democracy.

In this video, journalist @haylenaaa explains the key points of the new code.

"Does this term resonate with you?

For the first time ever, the 2022 Oxford word of the year has been decided by a public vote, and the winner is 'goblin mode'.

More than 340,000 English speakers, decided between a choice of three words (or phrases/hashtags given that 'word' is defined fairly loosely) narrowed down by lexicographers from Oxford University Press.

“Metaverse” was the second choice, followed by “#IStandWith”. Goblin mode was a landslide victory: it was selected by 318,956 people, making up 93% of the overall vote.

“Given the year we’ve just experienced, ‘goblin mode’ resonates with all of us who are feeling a little overwhelmed at this point”, the president of Oxford Languages, Casper Grathwohl said. “It’s a relief to acknowledge that we’re not always the idealised, curated selves that we’re encouraged to present on our Instagram and TikTok feeds.""

The hashtag #goblinmode on TikTok is often used as a rebuff of the “that girl” trend, which is all about being the “best version of yourself”, ie getting up early to exercise, performing elaborate skincare routines and drinking organic smoothies – and, of course, posting about all of this on social media.

The winning term was first seen on Twitter in 2009, but went viral in February 2022 after being tweeted in a mocked-up headline.

Goblin mode “embraces the comforts of depravity”, wrote our technology reporter @karipaul__ in March, who attributed the rise in the phrase’s usage to “the pandemic’s third year and the feared launch of World War Three”.

"“It was raining volcanic ash” said Heri Susanto who helped his family evacuate from their village near the erupted Mount Semeru in Indonesia.

The country’s highest volcano erupted over the weekend spewing hot ash clouds a mile high and rivers of lava down its side on Java island.

There were no immediate reports of any casualties from the Semeru volcano eruption, but local authorities were forced to launch a mass evacuation.

Mount Semeru, which is 400 miles east of the capital, Jakarta, erupted last year killing more than 50 people and displacing thousands.

With 142 volcanoes, Indonesia is home to 8.6 million people living within six miles of one - the world’s largest population living in close range of a volcano.

The country has also suffered a series of earthquakes recently, including one last month that killed more than 300 people.

Germany had been planning to wear the OneLove armband in support of LGBTQ+ rights in Qatar until Fifa announced at the last moment that they would face sporting sanctions for doing so. Instead, the players posed with hands over their mouths to indicate they felt they had been silenced.

People across Iran have been protesting for nearly three months, defying a deadly crackdown by regime forces. The demonstrations are seen as a fierce challenge to four decades of hardline clerical rule. 

The protesters’ cry of ‘Woman, Life, Freedom’ has galvanised the movement, which has travelled across the world, but within Iran there have been more than 18,000 arrests, violence and a rising death toll. 

According to human rights activists, Iran’s security forces have killed at least 448 people in the last 11 weeks, including 60 children under the age of 18 and 29 women.

The largest protests in a generation erupted in cities across China over the weekend against the government’s zero-Covid policy. 

The most widely used symbol in the demonstrations has been a blank sheet of paper. It symbolises censorship, and may also, some Twitter users pointed out, be read as a reference to the deaths last week of 10 people in a building fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang, which was blamed on lockdown restrictions that protesters believe prevented the residents from escaping in time.

"This is how Ngozi Fulani, the founder of the charity @sistahspace_, which provides support for African and Caribbean heritage women affected by abuse, has described her interaction with a royal aide at a reception hosted by the queen consort, Camilla. 

Fulani claimed the aide, who has been identified as Susan Hussey - the late queen’s lady-in-waiting and Prince William’s godmother - moved her hair to reveal her name badge and persistently questioned her over where her “people” came from, despite having been told she was a British national.
 
Fulani said she was left feeling traumatised and violated by the encounter, which took place on Tuesday at a violence against women and girls reception.

A spokesperson for the Prince of Wales said the comments were unacceptable and that “racism has no place in our society”. Buckingham Palace launched an immediate investigation, describing the remarks as “unacceptable and deeply regrettable”.

"For nearly 1,300 years, no one knew it was there ...

The name of a highly educated English woman, secretly scratched on to the pages of a rare medieval manuscript in the eighth century, but impossible to read – until now.

Academics have discovered the Old English female name Eadburg was repeatedly scored into the surface of the religious text, using a method that kept it hidden from the naked eye for more than 12 centuries.

The covert writing of the woman’s name was finally revealed when researchers at the Bodleian Library in Oxford used cutting-edge technology to capture the 3D surface of the ancient manuscript, a Latin copy of the Acts of the Apostles that was made in England between AD700 and AD750.

It is the first time this technology, capable of revealing “almost invisible” markings so shallow they measure about a fifth of the width of a human hair, has been used to record annotations on the surface of a manuscript.

“There are only a limited number of surviving early medieval manuscripts which contain clear internal evidence of a woman having created, owned or used them,” said Jessica Hodgkinson, a PhD student at the University of Leicester who made the discovery while researching her thesis on women and early medieval manuscripts.

Writing Eadburg’s name on the book quietly asserted her power and high status at a time when only a few elite, highly educated women were able to write and read both Old English and Latin. “It’s a hugely significant and very powerful text – the word of God, conveyed through the apostles. And I think that might be at least part of the reason why somebody chose to write Eadburg’s name into it, so that she was close to that.”

“Still, to this day, there’s this human urge to leave a mark of your presence on something that is meaningful to you or is a record of where you’ve been,” said Hodgkinson.

“We don’t know all that much about Eadburg, but now, because of this amazing technology, we’ve seen her name, we know she was there. She’s here, in this book – and it speaks across the centuries.”

It's an ancient cavalry sport that originated in south Asia centuries ago and it's rising in popularity in the UK.

Some claim neza bazi’s origins date back to the time of Alexander the Great, or the Persian empire. But historical records pinpoint its practice to Indian cavalry during the British Raj, when it was used as a military tactic to attack tents.

“They would send their crack team of tent pegging cavalry in to whip the pegs out, collapse the tents, create confusion because they’d all be asleep and stuck inside the tents. Then the infantry would finish them off, and they wouldn’t know what hit them,” said Jem Pearce, 44, a spokeswoman for the British Tent Pegging Association.

"The growing controversy over a PPE company linked to the Tory peer Michelle Mone has sparked an angry reaction in parliament, as MPs demanded an investigation into wider concerns over what one called “absolutely sickening, shameful and unforgivable” instances of politically connected firms profiteering from unusable PPE during the pandemic.

Parliamentarians on Thursday asked ministers for more information about how PPE Medpro was awarded more than £200m in government contracts after it was referred to ministers by Lady Mone.

Millions of pounds of PPE Medpro's profits were later transferred to a secret offshore trust fund of which Mone and her family members were beneficiaries. The gowns provided by this company were rejected after inspection and never used in the NHS. PPE Medpro insists the gowns passed inspection and that the company is entitled to keep the money.

Neil O’Brien, a junior health minister, defended the government's actions, denying that political connections played a role in the distribution of contracts, adding that the referral system connected ministers with members of the public who wanted to help plug shortages.

Mone’s lawyer last year said she “did not benefit financially and was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. On Thursday, Mone broke a 10-month silence on Twitter by sharing an image that said: “Don’t believe everything you read, or everything you think.”

During an urgent question tabled by the deputy leader of the opposition, Angela Rayner, the Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi said it was “absolutely sickening, shameful and unforgivable” that “chums of the Conservative party were profiteering” as the country struggled with Covid.

The Commons Speaker reminded members that parliamentary procedure meant MPs were not allowed to specifically criticise the conduct of Mone, a sitting member of the House of Lords.

Pointing to the T-shirt, another fan said 'the same exact T-shirt was worn at the last match – the Iran-England match. People wore the same exact T-shirt.'

The fan was also carrying a flag in Iranian colours but not the official national flag. She told Reuters that security later let her into the game after she changed into an official Iran soccer shirt and surrendered the flag.

During the match, which Iran went on to win 2-0, some Iranians carrying a flag with the words ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ were confronted in the stadium by security officials.

"“This get-rich-quick scheme to fast-track cronies, politically connected pals and colleagues was never going to end well. I suspect that today’s revelations, however shocking, are simply the tip of a very large iceberg – an iceberg that could yet sink this ship of fools.”

This is how the Scottish National Party's Brendan O'Hara referred to the Guardian's recent revelations that Tory peer Michelle Mone secretly received £29m from a 'VIP lane' PPE firm.

Lady Mone’s support helped newly formed company PPE Medpro secure a place in a “VIP lane” the government used during the coronavirus pandemic to prioritise companies that had political connections. The company went on to win two multi-million pound contracts supplying PPE to the NHS during Covid's first deadly wave.

Now, documents seen by the Guardian indicate that Mone and her children secretly received £29m of PPE Medpro’s profits, which were passed on from her husband through a series of offshore accounts, trusts and companies.

Contacted about the new disclosures, a lawyer for Mone said: “There are a number of reasons why our client cannot comment on these issues and she is under no duty to do so.” A lawyer who represents both her husband Douglas Barrowman and PPE Medpro said that an ongoing investigation limited what they were able to say on these matters. He added: “For the time being we are also instructed to say that there is much inaccuracy in the portrayal of the alleged ‘facts’ and a number of them are completely wrong.”

"""Human rights are non-negotiable""

Germany’s players placed hands over their mouths and wore rainbow stripes on their warm-up tops and boots in a show of defiance against Fifa before their World Cup match against Japan.

In a powerful statement published shortly after the game started, the German Football Association warned football’s governing body: “Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position ...
“It wasn’t about making a political statement – human rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted, but it still isn’t the case. That’s why this message is so important to us.”

Their message was reinforced by the German interior minister, Nancy Faeser, who also wore a OneLove armband, which promotes tolerance, diversity and LGBTQ+ rights, as she sat next to Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino at the Khalifa International Stadium in Qatar.

Germany are one of seven nations, including England and Wales, who were banned by Fifa from wearing the armband on Sunday. The fear of sporting sanctions – including captains receiving a yellow card at kickoff – had led the teams to backtrack from their promise to wear the OneLove in their World Cup matches.

However Danish football federation chief executive, Jakob Jensen, has confirmed that those nations were now exploring legal options to overturn Fifa’s decision.

"This is the moment five-year-old Azka was rescued from the rubble three days after Indonesia's deadly earthquake.

He was in his bedroom watching TV with his mother when the quake struck. Two members of his family were found dead, one relative said.

The death toll from the earthquake that struck Indonesia’s main island of Java on Monday had risen to 268 on Wednesday. Many of the dead are schoolchildren.

The quake, centred in the Cianjur region of West Java province, struck at a shallow depth of 6.2 miles (10km), triggering landslides and damaging buildings, including tens of thousands of homes and dozens of schools.

Henri Alfiandi, the head of the national search and rescue agency (Basarnas) said many of the victims were children who had been at school when the quake hit.

More than 12,000 army personnel were deployed on Wednesday to increase the strength of search efforts being carried out by more than 2,000 police, rescue workers and volunteers, said the National Disaster Mitigation Agency chief.

"“Devastated by the senseless act of violence”.

Those are the words of the mayor of Chesapeake, Rick West, after six people were killed in a shooting at a Walmart in Virginia last night - the second high-profile mass killing in the US in a handful of days. The assailant was also dead.

Leo Kosinski, a spokesperson with the police department, said in a brief news conference that officers received reports of a shooting at 10pm and arrived to find multiple fatalities. At the time, Kosinski said “no more” than 10 people were killed.

The Virginia shooting comes three days after a person opened fire at a gay nightclub in Colorado, killing five people and wounding 17. That shooter, who is nonbinary, was arrested after patrons at the club tackled them. The shootings come in a year when the US was shaken by the deaths of 21 in a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.

“I’m tired of waking up to texts about another mass shooting in America,” tweeted David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland 2018 school shooting in Florida, in the wake of the Chesapeake shooting yesterday.

40,000 people have died from gun violence deaths in 2022 alone, according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. Gun violence overtook car accidents as the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in the US in 2020, according to a report from the University of Michigan.

The Virginia state senator, Louise Lucas, said she was “absolutely heartbroken that America’s latest mass shooting took place in a Walmart in my district in Chesapeake, Virginia.

“I will not rest until we find the solutions to end this gun violence epidemic in our country that has taken so many lives.”

"Has The Simpsons predicted the future again? 🐡

In what looks like it could only have come from the nuclear lake in The Simpsons, an angler has caught the world's largest goldfish.

Andy Hackett caught the 30kg leather carp-koi hybrid, aptly named the Carrot, in Bluewater Lakes in Champagne, France.

That's nearly as heavy as five bowling balls.

It was put into the lake 20 years ago, and has proved to be a slippery customer ever since.

Hackett, from Kidderminster in Worcestershire, reportedly spent 25 minutes bringing the fish in.

It is a hybrid species of a leather carp and koi, and is thought to be the second largest of its type ever caught.

42-year-old Hackett said: “I always knew the Carrot was in there but never thought I would catch it.

“I knew it was a big fish when it took my bait and went off side to side and up and down with it. Then it came to the surface 30 or 40 yards out and I saw that it was orange.

“It was brilliant to catch it but it was also sheer luck.”

"At least 162 people have been killed after a magnitude-5.6 earthquake struck Indonesia’s main island of Java, triggering landslides and causing buildings to collapse.

“There are residents trapped” said Ridwan Kamil, the governor of West Java province, after a fatal quake, which was centred in the Cianjur region at a depth of 6.2 miles (10km).

Kamil told reporters that he believed the death toll was expected to rise based on the damage he has already seen, “So many buildings crumbled and shattered,” he said.

Footage from Cianjur showed a school building with a collapsed roof, as well as badly damaged homes where brick walls had been torn down. At a local hospital, overwhelmed by the number of victims, the injured were treated outside, some lying on mattresses or blankets on the ground as they were given oxygen masks and IV drips.

Indonesia is especially vulnerable to earthquakes because of its position on the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire”, the most seismically and volcanically active zone in the world.

"“We’re broken.”

Joshua Thurman has spoken about the moment he heard gunfire and saw a “flash from the muzzle of the gun” used in a mass shooting at an LGBTQ+ nightclub in Colorado Springs.

At least five people were killed and another 25 were injured in a shooting late Saturday, officials first said at least 18 people were wounded, though that number was increased after an update later in the day.

Thurman says the shooting has ‘shattered’ the local LGBTQ community, saying: “This is the only LGBTQIA+ space we have in the city of Colorado Springs. Where are we going to go? We can rebuild, we can do things but it’s not going to bring back the five people that died.”

There is a history of attacks at LGBTQ venues in the US. In 2016, a gunman killed 49 people and wounded more than 50 a gay nightclub in Orlando in one of the deadliest attacks in US history.

The attack took place at Club Q, a club that had a weekly drag show scheduled on Saturday evenings, according to an archived version of its website.

The shooting happened amid growing fears of violence and intimidation toward drag queens. Those fears were sparked by Republicans who have targeted drag queens with legislation that would ban drag shows entirely, prohibit drag story hours at libraries that are meant to familiarise children with them, and bar minors from attending drag shows.

"Did you know that coral is an animal?

Each structure that we know of as ‘coral’ is made up of thousands of tiny creatures which rely on algae for energy.

But this makes them incredibly temperature sensitive, and the heating of our seas and oceans is causing them to expel their algae, leaving behind the white skeletons seen in “bleaching” events.

Many of the world’s reefs now face an “existential crisis” with 14% lost between 2009 and 2018 - and even if the 1.5C limit on global heating is kept, more than 90% will be destroyed by severe aquatic heatwaves.

"Iranian security forces have opened fire on people at a metro station in Tehran and beaten women who were not wearing mandatory hair coverings as protests over the death of Mahsa Amini entered a third month.

Footage shared on social media showed passengers running towards exits, with many falling and being trampled, after police opened fire on a crowded platform. Police were also filmed through train windows marching through carriages and beating women with batons.

Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman of Kurdish origin, died in the custody of the morality police on 16 September after her arrest for an alleged breach of Iran’s strict dress code for women.

Demonstrations intensified on Tuesday, when protest organisers called for three days of action to commemorate “Bloody November” of 2019, when hundreds were killed during protests against raising fuel prices.

“We’ll fight! We’ll die! We’ll take back Iran!” dozens of protesters could be heard chanting around a bonfire on a Tehran street, in a video published by the 1500tasvir social media monitor. Protesters were also recorded chanting and setting headscarves on fire in metro stations.

In separate developments on Wednesday as many as 15 people were shot dead in Iran, including members of the security forces and a nine-year-old boy, in different incidents as the country experienced one of its most serious and widespread nights of protests of the past nine weeks.

The total number of deaths during the latest protests has spiralled to 348, according to Harana, a human rights agency, though the figures are impossible to verify. In at least three cities, seminaries were set alight.

"Republicans have won back control of the House of Representatives scraping a victory from a midterms election that many had expected to be a red wave of wins but which instead turned into more of a trickle.

Nevertheless, the party finally won its crucial 218th seat in the lower chamber of Congress, wresting away control from the Democrats and setting the stage for a showdown with Joe Biden in the next two years of his presidency.

The result means the end of Democrat Nancy Pelosi’s time as House speaker and is likely to pass the speaker’s gavel to Republican leader Kevin McCarthy who has announced his intention to take up the post.

"""You are threatening us by smashing the camera?”

World Cup organisers have apologised to a Danish television station whose live broadcast from a street in Doha was interrupted by Qatari officials who threatened to break their camera equipment.

The journalists were ""mistakenly interrupted"", the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy acknowledged in a statement. “Upon inspection of the crew’s valid tournament accreditation and filming permit, an apology was made to the broadcaster by on-site security before the crew resumed their activity,” organisers said.

Reporter Rasmus Tantholdt was speaking live to a news anchor in Denmark when three men drove up behind him on an electric cart and tried to block the camera lens. ""You invited the whole world to come here, why can’t we film? It’s a public place,"" said Tantholdt. ""You can break the camera, you want to break it? You are threatening us by smashing the camera?”

The incident revisited a subject that has been sensitive for tournament organisers who have denied claims there are strict limits on where media can film in Qatar. Organisers said they later spoke to Tantholdt and also ""issued an advisory to all entities to respect the filming permits in place for the tournament"".

Denmark’s football federation has been one of the biggest critics of Qatar over the emirate’s record on human rights and treatment of low-paid migrant workers. Danish players will wear match shirts that have a toned down badge and manufacturer’s logo as a protest in support of labour rights when they play France, Australia and Tunisia in their group.

"'We were lied to'

In the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections, the punditocracy of commentators, pollsters and political-types united behind the threat of a looming ""red wave"" of Republican gains.

But one dissenting voice stood out: that of leftist film-maker Michael Moore. Against all the commonplace predictions, he had forecast Democrats would do well. He called it a “blue tsunami”.

That proved to be true in his home state of Michigan, where Democrats won governor, house and senate for the first time in 40 years, often by large margins. It’s been more of a blue wall across the rest of the country, where Republican gains mostly failed to materialize, with the exception of Florida. 

But even so, the strong performance by Democrats has stunned people on both sides of the US political divide, delighting the left and sparking hand-wringing on the right.

With the Democrats retaining power in the Senate, and Republicans poised to take the House by only a handful of seats (vastly falling below expectations), suddenly Moore is looking like a prognosticator par excellence.

"Democrats have kept control of the Senate after the crucial race in Nevada was announced in their favor, cementing a midterms election performance for the party that widely beat expectations.

Democratic US senator Catherine Cortez Masto has now beaten Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, a former state attorney general who was endorsed by former president Donald Trump, the Associated Press said.

With Masto’s victory coming on the heels of Democratic senator Mark Kelly winning re-election in Arizona late on Friday, the win takes the Democrats to the crucial number of 50 seats in the Senate, with the Republicans at 49. 

The race in Georgia is set to go to a runoff in December, but even if Republicans win there, a 50-50 split means the Senate would effectively be controlled by the Democrats because the tying vote falls to the vice-president, Kamala Harris.

For the Republicans, it was another blow after they steeply underperformed in many races. The party had touted hopes of a “red wave” that could sweep across the US and deliver the upper chamber of Congress into their hands. Instead – with a few exceptions, such as Florida – the wave was more of a trickle.

The Democrat win in the Senate is likely to prompt further recrimination in Republican circles over who is to blame for the poor showing. 

Much attention has so far focused on Trump after he backed rightwing or celebrity candidates in several key races who lost, such as Dr Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania.

The victory is also another boost for president Joe Biden after his party defied immediate fears that his low popularity ratings and an electorate battered by high inflation would translate to punishment at the polls.

"“It’s humiliating”

A Kulkalgal activist from the Torres Strait Islands has said the way the world often treats Indigenous people is an insult and that he is here at the Cop27 conference in Egypt “fighting for our home”.

Yessie Mosby, who in September was part of a group of claimants who made history during a landmark legal case that found the Australian government should compensate Torres Strait Islanders for their climate crisis failures, told the Guardian that “we were a race of people that we have hold on to a lot of ancient knowledge, which is being neglected and pushed aside.”

“Whether it’s us in the saltwater, people of the Pacific Islands, or the people of the plains and the mountains, the swamps, who are facing climate change, and really want our voices to be heard. And we really need action.

“We the Torres Strait saltwater people we are so in tune with nature. We are a race that will see birds and they will tell us what the weather is going to be like tomorrow, we look at plants which tells us which particular fish are to be eaten or not to be eaten, we see plants which tells us that this particular fish in the water is poisonous.”

“The world definitely will have a lot to learn from us.”

"The Guardian’s Patrick Greenfield asked the World Bank president David Malpass if he was a climate denier at Cop27. This is what he said. 👆

“You know that I’m not [a climate denier]. So don’t misreport it,” he said when asked following an event. 

Malpass, a Donald Trump appointee, has previously said he did not “even know” if he accepted climate science. Joe Biden’s White House condemned his comments. Malpass later apologised. 

The World Bank has repeatedly failed to adopt a strong action plan on the climate crisis, and is under growing pressure to reform to help finance the climate transition in developing countries.

The bank’s president had rejected requests for interviews at Cop27 after he was delayed in South Africa before the climate summit when his plane got caught in lightning.

When approached on Wednesday, Malpass refused to answer questions about the need for World Bank reform before walking backstage.

"“We know they're happy for him to die, they just don’t want it to happen while the world is watching. But the world is watching.”

There were fraught scenes at the Cop 27 climate conference today as the sister of the jailed British-Egyptian activist, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, was harassed by a pro-regime lawmaker as she spoke at a press conference on the fears she has for her brother's life.

Writer Abd el-Fattah has been on hunger strike for nearly seven months, and told his family shortly before the beginning of the UN climate conference in Sharm el-Sheik that he would begin a water strike.

His family are demanding proof of life from the desert prison where he is currently held after failing to receive a letter that would provide information about his condition.

Speaking to the Guardian today, Seif added that she fears the Egyptian authorities will begin force feeding her brother in order to guarantee nothing happens ""while the world is watching"", which would be a form of torture, but added that she had no received any updates despite her mother waiting outside the prison for hours and attempts to push the UK government and Rishi Sunak to do more.

"The midterm elections are here. 

As US voters go to the polls today they are voting in what Joe Biden has framed as a vital test for American democracy in the face of a Republican party fielding candidates who buy into the ""big lie"" of a stolen 2020 election.

Republicans, meanwhile, have tried to capitalize on widespread economic anxiety in the face of rising inflation as well as stoking culture war themes and fears over crime, often spilling over into racism and intolerance.

Millions of voters are casting their ballot as both parties fight for control of Congress, numerous state governorships as well as many local offices and ballot initiatives on issues like abortion.

A handful of general scenarios could play out, each having momentous significance for the Biden presidency and the tactics of a resurgent Republican party and its de facto leader Donald Trump.

"“We’ve been excluded”

When 24-year-old Ugandan activist @mnyomb1 arrived in Egypt for the Cop27 climate summit today he was turned away from the high level talks because he did not have the right accreditation.

Only country delegates and some members of the press were allowed in the event for heads of states and government officials.

“Why are we here”, asks Nyombi - adding that the world leaders and negotiators who are currently deciding how far to push climate action need to quickly change the way they work and who they listen to, saying right now he doesn’t think it is right to truly call this an African Cop.

“You have to frontline the voices of African youth activists, because these are the innovators. These are the ones implementing actions, not our leaders, our leaders are just always in the office, but you are excluding us. So it is time to understand that this event is in Africa. We need to give African voices a chance ... We cannot lead without knowledge.”

"“We’re meant to be human beings, and we’re treating people like that?”
 
Hundreds gathered in the rain outside Manston detention centre in Kent at the weekend to demand its closure.
 
Several people raised placards reading “no one is illegal” and “refugees are welcome”, while others unfurled a banner reading “the enemy doesn’t arrive by boat – he arrives by limousine”.
 
The protest comes after it was revealed that the former military base, which opened as a processing centre for asylum seekers in February with the intention of holding a maximum of 1,600 people for 24 hours at a time, was housing about 4,000 people for weeks on end.
 
Some asylum seekers described the conditions at the airfield, which provides tented accommodation, as being “like a prison”, with reports of an outbreak of diphtheria.
 
A letter in a bottle, which was thrown over the fence by a young girl detained in the centre last week, said there were pregnant women and sick people being held there and that “we really need your help”.
 
A Home Office spokesperson said: “Manston remains resourced and equipped to process migrants securely and we will provide alternative accommodation as soon as possible.”.

Addressing the assembled world leaders, Guterres called for a “historic” climate solidarity pact between developed and emerging economies and argued that “humanity has a choice — cooperate or perish”.

"This week began with an astonishing political comeback in Brazil.

Brazil’s leftist former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – known as Lula – narrowly defeated far right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro by two percentage points.

By choosing Lula, Brazil is abandoning Bolsonaro’s far-right vision for the country, which has been characterised over the past three years by attacks on democratic institutions, the media, the left and the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Instead, the Brazilian electorate chose Lula and a platform that centred around social justice, environmental protection, defending democracy and reunifying the country.

Four more years of Bolsonaro would have had devastating environmental consequences, not just for Brazil but for the whole world. Two billion trees have been burned or cut down during his presidency – an area the size of greater London was lost in the first six months of 2022 alone.

So is there reason to be hopeful now?

Our Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips thinks there definitely is. And analysis conducted for Carbon Brief indicates that Lula’s victory could cut Amazon deforestation by 89% over the next decade.

"In the lead-up to the Cop27 climate summit, many activists have accused the organisers of ‘greenwashing’.

This is not the first time that the UN’s conference of the parties (Cop) has been accused of this, but the event this year has received extra criticism because it’s taking place in Egypt - a country with a poor human rights record and imprisoning activists.

At this very moment, Alaa Abd El-Fattah, one of Egypt’s most high-profile political prisoners is still behind bars after being imprisoned by the country’s authorities nine years ago. He’s currently on hunger strike and will refuse water from 6 November, the first day of the climate summit.

Many people don’t think that climate justice can be debated at Cop27 when it’s taking place in a country that imprisons activists and bans certain research. “Unless political freedoms are defended, there will be no meaningful climate action,” says author Naomi Klein.

Meanwhile, activists have also been making demands from the organisers to try and see Cop27 deliver greater climate action and change to the summit.

"Whether it's throwing soup on Van Gogh's Sunflowers, or scaling bridges, climate activist group Just Stop Oil have made more than a few waves during a month of protests throughout October.

Many say these striking protests are even more remarkable in that they have been funded in part by an oil heiress. Aileen Getty, a philanthropist whose grandfather was the tycoon J Paul Getty, co-founded the Climate Emergency Fund and has gifted it $1m to be used by activists.

Among thousands of other smaller donors to the fund, several other prominent figures have made major contributions – Abigail Disney, scion of the Disney family, has given $200,000 and Adam McKay, director of the darkly satirical climate film Don’t Look Up, has pledged $4m.

Theories have even been spread on social media that the stunt was aimed at discrediting climate activists, as part of an elaborate ruse concocted by Getty.

In an opinion piece from The Guardian last month, Aileen Getty wrote:
""I am the daughter of a famous family who built their fortune on fossil fuels... Our family sold that company four decades ago, and I instead vowed to use my resources to take every means to protect life on Earth.""

"Takeoff, the third member of Migos alongside the rappers Quavo and Offset, has died.

The 28-year-old rapper, real name Kirshnik Khari Ball, was fatally shot at a bowling alley in Houston where he and Quavo were playing dice around 2.30am; Takeoff was pronounced dead at the scene. Two other people on the premises were shot and taken to hospital. Quavo was unharmed.

On Twitter, friends and admirers paid tribute to the late rapper. “I remember Takeoff being a very down to earth, cool dude,” wrote boxer Chris Eubank Jr. “Can’t believe I’m having to say this again about another young black star being killed for no reason, something really has to change in the industry.”

Takeoff was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in 1994. He began rapping with Quavo and Offset, his uncle and cousin, respectively, in 2008 under the collective name Polo Club. In 2011, the trio released Juug Season, their debut mixtape as Migos.

In 2013, Migos released Versace, their first mainstream hit. The song was notable for popularising the triplet flow – Migos’ signature rapid-fire cadence – within modern rap, and was eventually remixed by Toronto rapper Drake, who would go on to have a long-running association with all three members of the group.

Migos are best known for their 2016 Lil Uzi Vert collaboration Bad and Boujee, which peaked at No 1 in the US, as well as Top 10 hits MotorSport, with Nicki Minaj and Cardi B, and Walk It Talk It, with Drake. As a solo artist, Takeoff released one album – 2018’s The Last Rocket, which debuted at No 4 in the US – and one record as a duo, last month’s Only Built for Infinity Links, with Quavo.",2022-11-01 14:42:02

"Is there a line in this song that resonates with you most?

An Iranian protest anthem that has become the soundtrack to the national uprising was again thrust into the international spotlight over the weekend when @coldplay performed a cover and broadcast it live around the world.

The British band played the song, Baraye, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Friday and Saturday night at the start of their world tour, with the exiled Iranian actor @golfarahani on stage and singing in Farsi.

Baraye, which means “For …” or “Because of …”, was written by one of Iran’s most popular musicians, @shervinine, with verses taken from online posts by Iranians explaining why they have been demonstrating against the country's regime. Days after the song was released, the 25-year-old was arrested and his song deleted from Instagram.

Iran has been gripped by protests since the death in custody on 16 September of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old of Kurdish origin who was arrested in Tehran by the “morality police” over her headscarf. Amini was allegedly beaten, taken to hospital in a coma and later died.

Since then, protests led by women have been met with violence by authorities, with at least 270 people dead and 14,000 arrested, according to the group Human Rights Activists in Iran.

Friday’s concert was streamed via satellite to cinemas in 81 countries, although not in Iran, where playing or singing the song could lead to arrest.

These are the words of Brazil's new leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, after his narrow victory over the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro.

The 77-year old, a former factory worker who became Brazil’s first working-class president exactly 20 years ago, has sealed an astonishing political comeback over Bolsonaro in one of the most significant and bruising elections in the country’s history.

With 99.97% of votes counted, Silva had secured 50.9% of the vote. Bolsonaro, a firebrand who was elected in 2018, received 49.10%.

Addressing journalists at a hotel in São Paulo, Lula vowed to reunify his country after a toxic race for power which has profoundly divided one of the world’s largest democracies.

Silva was sidelined from the 2018 election that saw Bolsonaro claim power after being jailed on corruption charges that were later annulled.

Tensions remain high in the country, with videos showing students jeering at government officials, demanding greater freedoms, and holding posters of fellow students who have been arrested.

A group of university students at the Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology in the Iranian capital, Tehran, have also held a vigil today to mark the 40 days since Amini’s death and the end of the traditional mourning period in Iran.

On the same day, Iranian security forces reportedly opened fire on mourners who had gathered in their thousands in Amini’s hometown to pay tribute at her grave.

Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian of Kurdish origin, died on 16 September, three days after her arrest by the morality police while visiting Tehran with her younger brother. Her death has sparked mass protests across Iran and abroad.

According to Oslo-based organisation Iran Human Rights, 141 demonstrators have been killed during the crackdown on the Amini protests, in an updated death toll on Tuesday.

At four weeks Dr Joan Fleischman, part of the MYA Network, uses a gentle handheld device that removes the tissue. This more delicate type of extraction keeps it intact.

The final slide shows the gestational sac of the pregnancy at nine weeks. This is everything that would be removed during an abortion and includes the nascent embryo, which is not easily discernible to the naked eye.

Sometimes, patients want to see the tissue after an abortion. “They are stunned by what it actually looks like,” says Dr Fleischman. “That’s when I realized how much the imagery on the internet and on placards – showing human-like qualities at this early stage of development – has really permeated the culture. People almost don’t believe this is what comes out.”

"""All I can say is that I am not daunted.""

Rishi Sunak has given his first speech outside Downing Street after being appointed as UK prime minister by King Charles.

He said Liz Truss was right to want to improve growth and that was a “noble aim”, but added that ""mistakes were made"" and he had been elected to fix them.

Sunak also paid tribute to Boris Johnson “for his incredible achievements as prime minister” and said the mandate earned by the Conservative party in 2019 does not belong to any individual: ""It is a mandate that belongs to
and unites all of us.""

The former chancellor, who resigned dramatically from Johnson’s government in July, has become the third Conservative prime minister in less than two months and the fifth in six years.

Sunak takes on the role at a time of deep economic crisis, and is expected to make tough decisions on taxation and public spending that may prove unpopular. He is expected to announce who will be in his cabinet soon.

"‣ UK's first prime minister of colour
‣ First Hindu prime minister
‣ Youngest PM since 1812
‣ And the richest British PM in history

Some big firsts have been hit by Rishi Sunak's elevation to UK prime minister, and there have been a swell of responses online to Sunak's unprecedented wealth. This is first time in history that the occupants of No 10 Downing Street will be richer than the monarch in Buckingham Palace.

Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, are sitting on a combined fortune of about £730m – roughly double the estimated £300m-£350m wealth of King Charles III and Camilla, Queen Consort.

Earlier this year, the 42-year-old became the first frontline politician to ever be included in the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s wealthiest people.

At at a time when millions of Britons are struggling with a cost of living crisis, what do you think of the country's leader being so wealthy?

"Breaking: Rishi Sunak has won the Conservative leadership contest and will become the UK's third prime minister in the space of seven weeks, taking over from Liz Truss.

The former chancellor, who has been an MP for seven years and was in the cabinet for just over two years, was confirmed as the winner on Monday after the only other remaining candidate, Penny Mordaunt, failed to reach the threshold of 100 nominations from her fellow MPs. Former prime minister Boris Johnson pulled out of the accelerated leadership contest last night.

Sunak, whose parents are of Punjabi Indian heritage, will be the first person of colour to become UK prime minister, as well as the first practising Hindu selected for the job. He is not the first minority ethnic PM – Benjamin Disraeli, who held the office twice between 1868 and 1880, was of Jewish heritage.

Sunak is likely to formally take over as prime minister from Truss in the next day or so. If he takes over tomorrow, Truss will have served as prime minister for just 50 days, the shortest tenure in history. She agreed to step down last Thursday after chaos within her cabinet and amid a turbulent reaction to her mini-budget in September.

"In a town in northern Philippines where floods have become a perennial problem, motorcycle taxi drivers have modified their vehicles to keep passengers dry and high above the knee- to waist-deep floodwaters.

Motorcycle taxis, a popular form of transport in rural Philippines, have had steel tubes added to the forks of the vehicles, boosting them by a few extra feet to allow them to operate in the worst kinds of floods.

Some streets in Hagonoy just outside the capital Manila have been impassable in recent years, with rain levels reaching as high as two metres (6.5 feet) in monsoon season, when residents either wade through thigh-deep water or travel in small boats.

One of the town’s problems, according to officials, is the rapid rise in informal dwellings along a nearby river and lack of adequate waste management solutions.

Until things change, many of those living in Hagonoy say the modified motorbikes have become a godsend for them to go about their daily lives.

"Should we take this as a compliment?

The UK home secretary, Suella Braverman, has blamed ‘Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati’ for the disruptions caused by protesting.

Over the past week, the climate action group Just Stop Oil has been hitting the headlines for a series of demonstrations, the latest of which involved blocking a major motorway between Essex and Kent yesterday.

That prompted the home secretary, Suella Braverman, to attack you, dear reader, as responsible for disruption to traffic, saying: “I’m afraid it’s the Labour party, it’s the Lib Dems, it’s the coalition of chaos, it’s the Guardian-reading, tofu-eating, wokerati – dare I say the anti-growth coalition that we have to thank for the disruption we are seeing on our roads today.”

"Ukraine is using sandbags to try to protect its cultural monuments from Russian bombs.

""Boxed up, muffled, veiled and hidden, they give Kyiv a strange new look – as if the sculptures have been replaced by contemporary artworks,"" the Guardian's Charlotte Higgins writes.

For two Mondays in a row Russia has launched missiles at Kyiv’s city centre, in the most intense strikes on the capital since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The targets of these missiles are unclear – if they were meant to strike crucial infrastructure, the only real clarity is that they have exploded in central, residential districts, falling close to parks, offices and cultural buildings.

Two of last week’s explosions were so close to significant national monuments that some speculated that the statues themselves might have been the targets.

"Russia launched a wave of 28 drones against Ukraine’s capital this morning killing at least three people.

Photos showed the drones swooping low across the skies of Kyiv as police officers fired at them from the ground and residents scurried to shelters. Other images showed smoke rising from explosions across the city.

Kyiv’s mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, said a woman died from one of the blasts in the city’s central Shevchenkiv district, and another person was trapped under the rubble of a house.

According to Ukrainian military officials, “kamikaze” drones are cheaper and less sophisticated than missiles but have proved effective at causing damage to targets on the ground. The Shahed-136 drones are able to remain airborne for several hours and circle over potential targets before being flown into enemy troops, armour or buildings and explode on impact.

It comes just days after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, promised there would be ‘no need for more massive strikes’ on Ukraine.

"China’s president, Xi Jinping, walked into the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday to open the Communist party summit and lay out his vision for the next five years. 

Xi Jinping celebrated China’s crushing of Hong Kong’s autonomy, and warned Taiwan that the “wheels of history” are turning towards Beijing taking control of the island democracy, as he opened a key Communist party summit.

He sees seizing Taiwan as a key part of his legacy and a requirement for China’s “national rejuvenation”. China will never renounce the option of using force to achieve it, he said, repeating a familiar talking point.

“The wheels of history are rolling on towards reunification and the rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation. Complete reunification must be realised and it can without a doubt be achieved,” Xi said on Sunday, drawing the strongest applause of the speech.

“We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force.”

A major reshuffle will take place in the Chinese Communist party’s top echelon at the 20th party congress in Beijing this week, a twice-a-decade meeting that began in the capital yesterday.

Xi, who scrapped term limits in 2018, is expected to be formally returned to power this week for a precedent-breaking third term. Over 104 minutes his speech gave a foretaste of what is in store for the next half decade.

"“Not now, not ever.”

Ten years ago this week, Julia Gillard gave her famous speech against misogyny in the workplace as Australia’s first female prime minister.

Gillard stood up in parliament, called out the then-opposition leader and demanded a higher standard in her workplace.

That was a decade ago but what about sexism in the workplace today?

Just this week, a damning report leaked to the Guardian revealed that the Royal College of Nursing in the UK, the world’s biggest nurses’ union, has exposed bullying, misogyny and a sexual culture where women are at risk of “alcohol and power-related exploitation”.

Last month, on International Equal Pay Day, the International Labour (ILO) Organization revealed that on average, women globally are paid about 20 per cent less than men.

This pay gap is even bigger for Black and Hispanic women and a study in the US found that last year Black women averagely earnt 63.9% less than white men and Hispanic or Latina women earn 57.3% less.
A decade later and workplaces continue to prejudice against women workers.

"Robbie Coltrane, whose acting career spanned everything from Bond films to Cracker to Harry Potter, has died aged 72.

Born Anthony Robert McMillan in the prosperous Glaswegian suburb of Rutherglen, Coltrane was educated at Glenalmond College, an independent boarding school whose corporal punishment he described as “legalised violence”, before going to the Glasgow School of Art.

He had second thoughts about his ability as a painter, and switched to live performance, acting in radical theatre companies (including a troupe from San Quentin State prison) and doing standup, taking the pseudonym Coltrane as homage to celebrated jazz musician John Coltrane.

His first screen credit was Waterloo Sunset, the Richard Eyre-directed Play for Today in 1979, in which he played opposite Queenie Watts’s care-home escapee.

Coltrane’s raised status was confirmed by his casting as the criminal psychologist “Fitz” Fitzgerald in Jimmy McGovern’s TV series Cracker, which first aired in 1993. A defiantly non-comic role, Fitzgerald was a groundbreaking creation: brilliant at his job but a mess in his personal life. Coltrane won the best TV actor Bafta in 1994, 1995 and 1996 for the role.

He found himself at the top of the list for the casting of Hogwarts’ school groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid in the film adaptation of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series. The first in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, was released in 2001, and gained Coltrane a new audience of younger fans.

"The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay $965m to people who suffered from his false claim that the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax, a jury in Connecticut decided.

The verdict is the second major judgment against the Infowars host over his relentless promotion of the lie that the 2012 massacre never happened, and that the grieving families seen in news coverage were actors hired as part of a plot to take away people’s guns.

It came in a lawsuit filed by the relatives of five children and three educators killed in the mass shooting, plus an FBI agent who was among the first responders to the scene. A Texas jury in August awarded nearly $50m to the parents of another slain child.

The Connecticut trial featured tearful testimony from parents and siblings of the victims, who told about how they were threatened and harassed for years by people who believed the lies told on Jones’ show.

Strangers showed up at their homes to record them. People hurled abusive comments on social media. Erica Lafferty, the daughter of slain Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, testified that people mailed rape threats to her house. Mark Barden told of how conspiracy theorists had urinated on the grave of his seven-year-old son, Daniel, and threatened to dig up the coffin.

Testifying during the trial, Jones acknowledged he had been wrong about Sandy Hook. The shooting was real, he said. But both in the courtroom and on his show, he was defiant.

He called the proceedings a “kangaroo court”, mocked the judge, called the plaintiffs’ lawyer an ambulance chaser and labeled the case an affront to free speech rights. He claimed it was a conspiracy by Democrats and the media to silence him and put him out of business.

Jones now faces a third trial, in Texas around the end of the year, in a lawsuit filed by the parents of another child killed in the shooting.

It is unclear how much of the verdicts Jones can afford to pay. During the trial in Texas, he testified he couldn’t afford any judgment over $2m. Free Speech Systems has filed for bankruptcy protection. But an economist testified in the Texas proceeding that Jones and his company were worth as much as $270m.",2022-10-13 02:40:59

• Older people appear to be at slightly higher risk of developing long Covid symptoms, notably kidney problems and mental health conditions, according to CDC research. But the risk isn’t much lower for younger people.

• People who were hospitalized with Covid-19 are probably at higher risk of developing long Covid symptoms compared with those who were not, according to a meta analysis of dozens of studies. But even people who had a mild case of Covid have a pretty good chance of experiencing long Covid symptoms.

• Women are more likely to develop long Covid symptoms, according to the meta-analysis. This is in line with previous studies showing women have a higher risk level.

• Being vaccinated may reduce your chances of developing long Covid symptoms, according to several studies. But it's not always completely clearcut, with one recent study showing a limited impact.

Lansbury was born in London in 1925, to Irish actor Moyna Macgill and Edgar Lansbury, a politician and timber merchant who died when she was nine. Following the Blitz, Lansbury, two of her siblings and her mother relocated to the US, where she trained at New York’s Feagin School of Drama and Radio. She went on to receive an Oscar nomination for her first film role, aged 19, in the 1944 film Gaslight, and starred in the hit film National Velvet, as well as a steady stream of other MGM productions during the 1940s.

After more minor roles, Lansbury came to prominence once again in the 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate, however it wasn’t until 1966, when she took the lead title in the musical Mame, that she reached widespread prominence. 

However, she will be best known to many for playing the role of Jessica Fletcher in the US crime drama Murder, She Wrote. An international success, the whodunit drama ran from 1984 and 1996 and made a global star of the actor who played its lead, a crime writer and would-be detective. She also exec produced the show, via Corymore Productions, a production company she started with her late husband Peter Shaw, who died in 2003. Lansbury also notably voiced Mrs Potts in the 1991 Disney film Beauty and the Beast.

Lansbury received five Tony Awards, six Golden Globes and an Olivier Award as well as an Honorary Oscar and a Lifetime Achievement Award from BAFTA over the course of her career. In 2014 she was made by a dame by Queen Elizabeth II.",2022-10-11 23:00:57

They weren’t alone, however. On the same day, protesters from Just Stop Oil, Extinction Rebellion and other environmental groups were out on the streets calling for the government to act on the growing climate crisis.

With an “autumn of anger” expected, and people increasingly willing to take action on the streets, can these two, often separate, groups find common ground and unite to finally create political change?

"Russia has launched a massive wave of strikes targeting cities across Ukraine in response to an attack on the Kerch bridge linking Russia and Crimea.

Barely hours after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, denounced the bridge attack on Saturday as an “act of terrorism” that he blamed on Ukraine’s secret services, missiles slammed into the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, during morning rush-hour.

President Zelenskiy urged people to take shelter, saying: “Such a time and such targets were specially chosen to cause as much damage as possible. Stay in shelters today. Always follow the safety rules.”

Zelenskiy also said the wave of missile attacks on Ukrainian cities by Russian forces had targeted energy supplies and people, and were chosen to cause as much damage to civilians as possible.

According to Ukraine’s military, by mid-morning on Monday, 75 missiles had been launched, of which it claimed over 40 had been intercepted.
Explosions also rocked the cities of Lviv, Ternopil and Dnipro after overnight strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia for the third night in a row.

In the immediate aftermath of the first wave of missiles, Ukraine’s defence ministry said it would seek revenge. “There is sacrifice amongst people and destruction,” the ministry said on its Facebook page. “The enemy will be punished for the pain and death brought upon our land! We will get our revenge!”

The last attack on Kyiv was in June, leading to a relative return to normality in the city. But unlike previous attacks that mostly hit Kyiv’s outskirts, Monday’s strikes targeted several locations in the very centre of the city.

"Iranian schoolchildren were being arrested inside school premises on Sunday by security forces arriving in vans without licence plates, according to reports on social media as protests against the regime entered their fourth week - with young women emerging as powerful voices of dissent against the regime.

On Friday, reports began to surface of the death of a second teenage girl at the hands of security forces in Iran. Sarina Esmailzadeh, a 16-year-old who posted popular vlogs on YouTube, was killed when the security forces beat her with batons at a protest in Gohardasht in Alborz province on 23 September, according to Amnesty International.

The news came after allegations surrounding the circumstances of another 16-year-old Nika Shakarami’s death had been circulating on social media. She was reported missing on 20 September after joining a protest in Tehran, amid claims that she had been beaten, raped and her body stolen and buried by the regime in a village away from her family.

Although the authorities claimed that Shakarami killed herself, her mother has accused the security services of murdering her, claiming that they tried to force her to say her daughter had taken her own life.

Separately, officials had also told Esmailzadeh’s family that investigations had concluded her death was a result of suicide. Citing a primary source, a statement by Amnesty claimed that her family had been subjected to “intense harassment to coerce them into silence”, claims denied by Iranian officials.

Protests started in Kurdish regions of Iran after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country’s feared morality police who had detained her for being in violation of the dress code for women.

Iran’s leaders have attempted to characterise the protests as a foreign plot, and a separatist push by a Kurdish minority. However, a groundswell of people from all walks of life continues to fuel a movement that is drawn from widespread social grievance.

"From major portraits of the likes of Naomi Campbell, FKA Twigs and Tyler, the Creator to cover shoots for leading magazines, Campbell Addy has quickly become one of the most in-demand photographers of his generation.

@campbelladdy has now released a new book which features his striking imagery woven between trailblazing Black creatives reflecting on the first time they say they felt seen in their industry.

""The first time I got in front of the camera lens and looked up to see Campbell Addy, I realised something special was happening,"" @naomi told the Guardian in a 2019 interview.

""There was something in that moment that felt sacred. It occurred to me that this was the first time a Black photographer had shot me for a mainstream publication in my 33-and-a-half-year career.""

Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who styled Tyler, the Creator in this gallery, says: ""I spent a lot of time trying to make myself smaller so I could slip through the cracks or camouflage the parts of me that didn’t “fit”. André Leon Talley [the late creative director of Vogue] was the first Black person I became aware of who had a seat at the table – at the very top of the mountain – who insisted on taking up space. He represented possibility to me.""

Addy, who is also a filmmaker, says he balances his own experiences as a queer, Black photographer who left his Jehovah’s Witness family home at 16 with broader questions of identity, intimacy and art which face many creatives today. ""I thought, well, where do I fit in as an image-maker? Once you get rid of the queer, the Black, the male, whatever, then it’s just my interests. The things I like to explore.

""... In theory, my work is about showcasing. It’s about putting things within my world under the microscope. My book is about feeling seen because every person, every object, needs to be handled with care. That’s kind of where the title came from.""

Addy's new book, Feeling Seen, is out now through Prestel Publishing.

"‘It’s too much, too fast’

Over the past decade, a once bucolic California town has become one of the biggest US hubs for the e-commerce industry.

A 45-minute drive east of Los Angeles, Ontario now has the highest amount of warehouse space in the Inland Empire region, and one of the highest in the US. Within just a few years, the e-commerce and logistics industries have reshaped not only the town’s landscape, but also its air, its job market, its politics and its way of life.

In addition to the 4.1m-square-foot Amazon facility under construction, three other Amazon facilities as well as a sprawl of warehouses for FedEx, Nike, and other companies dot the landscape.

The changes have come quickly, but also quietly. While neighboring communities have been publicly fighting warehouse projects abutting schools and boxing in homes, in Ontario, many residents said they hadn’t noticed just how many new warehouses had cropped up on fallowed fields and along old country roads – until they were surrounded.

“I’ve seen two warehouses go up along my drive to work just since September,” said Andrea Galván, who lives in an older residential neighborhood in northern Ontario.

“It’s too much, too fast,” she said.

"Microplastics have been detected in human breast milk for the first time, with scientists greatly concerned over the potential health impacts on babies.

Infants are especially vulnerable to chemical contaminants and the researchers said further studies were urgently needed. However, they stressed that breastfeeding remains by far the best way to feed a baby.

The Italian scientists recorded the mothers consumption of food and drink in plastic packaging and of seafood, as well as the use of plastic-containing personal hygiene products. But they found no correlation with the presence of microplastics.

This suggests the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the environment “makes human exposure inevitable”, the researchers said.

With huge amounts of plastic waste being dumped in the environment, microplastics now contaminate the entire planet: from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People consume the tiny particles via food and water as well as breathing them in, and they have been found in the faeces of babies and adults.

Previous research has shown toxic effects of microplastics in human cell lines, lab animals and marine wildlife but the impact on living humans remains unknown.

Prof Dick Vethaak, who recently led a team at VU University Amsterdam in discovering microplastics’ presence in human blood, warned: “We see only the tip of the iceberg with microplastics.

"♟The chess world has been rocked to its foundations by a scandal involving allegations of cheating, dramatic game forfeits and speculation over vibrating anal beads.

A chess match that took place last month between the world champion, Magnus Carlsen and 19-year-old American Hans Niemann has turned into a part soap opera, part whodunnit.

Carlsen quit the prestigious $500,000 (£447,000) Sinquefield Cup after losing to Niemann and then accused the teenager of cheating.
Since then a cloud of suspicion has hung over the sport, along with increasingly wild theories about cheating using vibrating anal beads.

Niemann denies cheating in this game against Carlsen, and responded to the rumours by saying: “They want me to strip fully naked? I’ll do it. I don’t care because I know I know that I’m clean and I’m willing to subject myself to what you want me to play.”

But, Niemann did confess to violating the rules of fair play at least twice in the past by using the assistance of chess engines: first as a 12-year-old in an online tournament, and then as a 16-year-old playing unrated games while streaming.

Then this week, a Chess.com report has offered compelling data-driven evidence that dramatically contradicts those statements. The 72-page report made no conclusions regarding Niemann’s over-the-board games, but did flag contests from six of his stronger in-person events, stating they “merit further investigation based on the data”.

This scandal has engulfed chess and left fans of the sport fearful for its future, as @guardian_sport’s chief reporter, @seanmarkingle explains.

"This year will be remembered as a watershed year for the escalating climate crisis. Dozens of countries have been hit by extreme weather so far in 2022. Millions have been driven from their homes by flood, fire or drought, while food and energy shortages are becoming acute in many regions.

But what has taken us so long for meaningful action to save our planet?

""People are saying the climate crisis is real, only because it has knocked on the door of the global north,"" says Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate.

The 54 countries in Africa combined account for 15% of the world’s population but contribute less than 4% of global greenhouse emissions – in contrast to 23% by China, 19% by the US, and 13% from the European Union. Right now, more than 18 million people are facing severe hunger due to extreme droughts in the Horn of Africa.

The countries suffering the worst effects of climate change are not the ones who caused the climate crisis. Here 25-year-old @vanessanakate1 speaks about about this extreme climate injustice, and what needs to be done about it.

Cop27 takes place in November this year in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. Countries from across Africa – and the wider global south – will be looking to secure billions of dollars of climate financing for adaptation and the green energy transition, as well as separate funds for loss and damage and reparations.

Iranian authorities introduced a social media blackout in response to viral videos of women cutting their hair and burning the hijab in a movement calling for fundamental change.

"Handmaid's tale or an exciting breakthrough?

In a world first - a synthetic embryo with a beating heart has been created without the need for sperm, eggs and fertilisation.

Scientists at the Weizmann Institute in Israel found that stem cells from mice could be made to self-assemble into early embryo-like structures.

The researchers believe the work could also reduce animal experimentation and ultimately pave the way for new sources of cells and tissues for human transplantation. For example, skin cells from a leukaemia patient could potentially be transformed into bone marrow stem cells to treat their condition.

When compared with natural mouse embryos, the synthetic embryos were 95% the same in terms of their internal structure and the genetic profiles of the cells. As far as the scientists could tell, the organs that formed were functional. But crucially, these synthetic embryos did not have the potential to develop into live animals, or at least they hadn’t when they had been transplanted into the wombs of female mice.

Speaking to StatNews, Prof Paul Tesar, a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University, said the more scientists pushed stem cell-derived embryos further and further along the path of development, the more the synthetic and natural embryos begin to merge.

“There will always be a grey area,” he said. “But as scientists and as a society we need to come together to decide where the line is and define what is ethically acceptable.”

"This protest song by one of Iran’s most popular musicians has become the soundtrack to the country’s biggest civil uprising for decades, channeling the rage of Iranians at home and abroad.

Shervin Hajipour, 25, who was reportedly arrested days after the song was released, created the lyrics to Baraye, meaning ‘For …’ or ‘Because of …’ in Farsi, entirely from messages that Iranians have posted online about why they are protesting.

In the song, Hajipour sings lyrics such as, “For dancing in the streets, for kissing loved ones,” and “for women, life, freedom,” a chant that has become the rallying cry of the wave of protests following 22-year-old Mahsa Amini’s death in police custody.

The song, which was released online last week, quickly went viral, being viewed millions of times across various platforms.

However, sources close to Hajipour believe the singer was made to remove the song from Instagram when he was arrested. It has since been registered as having been written by someone else, allowing copyright infringement complaints to be made and the song being removed by platforms it had been uploaded to. Despite this, the song has already been widely shared and continues to be uploaded by users on YouTube.

A campaign is under way calling on the public to nominate the song for a Grammy in the best song for social change category.

"""This makes a mockery of people’s efforts to reduce their own emissions”.

New figures have revealed that 40,000 ghost planes — planes that fly with less than 10% of passengers — took off or landed in the UK since 2019, with an average of 130 flights a month having no passengers on at all.

Campaigners have called these flights “a vast waste of money and a needless source of emissions”.

“Following a summer of record-breaking, runway-melting heat, this wanton waste of carbon by airlines flies in the face of those feeling the full brunt of our warming world,” says Alethea Warrington, at climate charity Possible.

Airlines do not publish information about why these flights happen, prompting campaigners to call for more transparency to understand why these “inefficient, polluting practices” continue, and to hold the main airline culprits to account.

"Putin has just formally annexed the occupied territories of Ukraine in four regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia - marking the largest forcible takeover of territory in Europe since the second world war.

How did this happen? It started when Russia held fake referendums over the last week in order to claim a mandate for the territorial claims, which Ukrainians have described as a vote held at gunpoint.

Why is Putin doing this? Analysts say that Russia is carrying out these annexations as an attempt to halt Ukraine’s recent successful counterattack.

By declaring these territories to be part of Russia, Moscow is threatening an overwhelming response, including a possible nuclear attack, as a part of a defensive war unless Ukraine halts its successful efforts to liberate its own territories. By threatening a massive escalation, Russia is seeking to slow its losses until its forces can regroup.

How has the rest of the world responded to the news? Many world leaders have publicly condemned Putin’s move and the EU announced they ‘reject and unequivocally condemn’ annexation.

US ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink has reiterated her country’s opposition to Russia’s annexations, saying “We will never recognise Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory.”

Ukrainians living in the four annexed occupied territories have been trying to flee since it became clear that Russia was trying to take control of these areas. A civilian convoy of cars heading to pick up relatives trying to flee Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine was hit earlier this morning by Russian forces near the city of Zaporizhzhia, with initial reports suggesting at least 25 people have been killed and at least 50 wounded.

"“I’ll fight like a lioness”

No one does political rags to riches stories quite like Brazil, but even in a nation where the most celebrated president in decades once shined shoes to survive, the story of Erika Hilton takes some beating.

As a teenager she came out to her family as transgender and was kicked out of her home aged 14. She spent several years as a sex worker in rural Brazil before reconnecting with her mother and studying teaching and gerontology at university. 

Discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ communities in Brazil are widespread and the country has the highest levels of violence against trans people in the world. 

In the face of this stark reality, Hilton moved into student politics, joined the leftwing PSOL party and in 2020 became the first transgender person elected to the city council, Brazil’s largest.

Now, as the country heads to the polls in this Sunday’s general election, the activist and politician hopes the vote will not only mark the end of the far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro’s presidency, but will also see her elected to a Congress with the leftist Lula da Silva at the helm.

"Protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini are becoming more deadly, with anger spreading across the country and security forces escalating their crackdown against protesters.

Mahsa Amini was a 22-year-old who died in police custody after allegedly wearing the hijab ‘in an improper way’. She was visiting Tehran with her family when she was stopped by morality police officers, enforcers of the Iranian government’s conservative rules on how women should dress.

Authorities have attributed Amini’s death to underlying health conditions, but her family and protesters across Iran believe she was beaten and tortured.

News of her death triggered national outrage, with protests spreading to as many as 80 cities.

Seventy-six people have reportedly been killed and thousands more arrested, and the Iranian government has restricted the use of the internet and social media.

Because of the country’s crackdown, we haven’t heard from many people living in Iran but support for their protests has been growing elsewhere.

"The rapper Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr, has died at the age of 59 in Los Angeles, his manager has confirmed.

Coolio is best known for his 1995 single Gangsta’s Paradise, for which he won a Grammy for best solo rap performance. The runaway hit came from the soundtrack of the Michelle Pfeiffer film Dangerous Minds and sampled Stevie Wonder’s 1976 song Pastime Paradise.

He was nominated for five other Grammys during a career that began in the late 1980s. His career took off with the 1994 release of his debut album, It Takes a Thief, on Tommy Boy Records. 

A year later, Gangsta’s Paradise would become a No 1 single, with its haunting opening lyrics: “As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/ I take a look at my life and realize there’s nothin’ left/ ’cause I’ve been blastin’ and laughin’ so long that/ even my mama thinks that my mind is gone.”

Earlier this year, the song hit one billion views on YouTube. “I want to thank everybody for all the years of love and being there for me,” Coolio said in a video marking the milestone, Billboard reported. “I hope I got you through some good times and got you through some bad times.”

Pfeiffer was among those to pay tribute to the rapper. In a post on Instagram, the actress said: “Heartbroken to hear of the passing of the gifted artist @coolio. A life cut entirely too short … I remember him being nothing but gracious. 30 years later I still get chills when I hear (Gangsta’s Paradise).”

Rapper Ice Cube wrote on Twitter: “This is sad news. I witness first hand this man’s grind to the top of the industry. Rest In Peace.”

Born in Monessen, Pennsylvania, south of Pittsburgh, Coolio moved to Compton, California, where he went to community college. He worked as a volunteer firefighter and in airport security before devoting himself full-time to hip-hop. His early work for firefighting crews in the San Jose area was “a way to clean up”, he told the Los Angeles Times in 1994. “In firefighting training was discipline I needed. We ran every day. I wasn’t drinking or smoking or doing the stuff I usually did.”

"This is Zaynab Mohammed Ayoub playing with her toys next to the rubble of her demolished home in the Palestinian village of Fahit in Massafer Yattah.

After a two-decade legal battle, Israel’s high court ruled in May that about 1,000 Palestinians can be evicted from an area of the West Bank and the land repurposed for Israeli military use.  The ruling, which contravenes international law, was one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began in 1967. 

Israel designated the 3,000ha (7,410 acre) area of the barren south Hebron hills as a military training zone – Firing Zone 918 – in the 1980s. After decades of legal battles, however, four months ago the supreme court finally agreed with the IDF’s argument that the people living in Masafer Yatta could not prove they were residents before the firing zone was established.

Now, the homes and livelihoods of the entire community are at risk, and the army, together with illegal Israeli settlers, is increasing the pressure to try to get the Palestinians to leave.

The Ayoub house was demolished by bulldozers in an operation supervised by the Israel Defence Forces a few weeks after the ruling, leaving them living in a tent all summer. Now they are preparing to relocate into the cave before winter comes. 

“We have no choice,” said Mohammed Ayoub, the head of the extended family of 17. “We have been sleeping in the village clinic since our home was destroyed, but we have to find an alternative.”

"Would you trust a cyborg cockroach to save your life?

If an earthquake strikes in the not-too-distant future and survivors are trapped under tonnes of rubble, the first responders to locate them could be a swarm of cockroaches with backpacks.

That's a potential application of a recent breakthrough by Japanese researchers who have discovered a way to mount solar electronic batteries on the bugs and direct their movements via remote control.

‘The main purpose we think this could be used for is searching for survivors in places where disasters have occurred,’ says senior research scientist Kenjiro Fukuda, Senior research scientist.

Fukuda and his team chose Madagascar hissing cockroaches for the experiments because they are big enough to carry the equipment and have no wings that would get in the way. Even when the backpack and film are glued to their backs, the bugs can traverse small obstacles or right themselves when flipped over.

"Via @guardianus: there is a “rapid acceleration” of book censorship occurring across the US, with more than 2,500 different book bans taking place over the past school year, a new report has found.

A total of 1,648 individual book titles, many of them that mention issues relating to race or sexuality, were the subject of bans by school districts in 32 states in the last school year, according to the new analysis.

More than 5,000 schools nationally have had books barred from access by students in libraries and classrooms, according to the report by Pen America, a non-profit that supports freedom of expression in literature.

There has been a “proliferation of organized efforts to advocate for book removals”, the report states, from rightwing politicians in states such as Texas, Georgia and Wisconsin to at least 50 groups that have sprung up either in-person or on Facebook.

Many of the books have been banned for simply featuring people who identify as LGBTQ+, with a third of all book bans from April to June including people with such identities, often under a spurious justification that the titles are “obscene”. Race and discussion of America’s racist past is also a target of book bans, with 40% of titles banned featuring prominent characters of color.

“While we think of book bans as the work of individual concerned citizens, our report demonstrates that today’s wave of bans represents a coordinated campaign to banish books being waged by sophisticated, ideological and well-resourced advocacy organizations,” said Suzanne Nossel, chief executive officer of Pen America.

"Could this save the world from a future planet-killing asteroid?

Nasa’s Dart spacecraft has crashed into the asteroid Dimorphos 6.8m miles from Earth in the space agency’s first “planetary defense test”.

Dart (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) collided head-on with an asteroid the size of a football stadium on Monday in an unprecedented full-scale test of Nasa’s capacity to defend Earth from a doomsday scenario.

The test was humanity’s first attempt at moving another celestial body, to see if a large asteroid hurtling towards Earth could be diverted

"A gunman with a swastika on his T-shirt has killed 15 people, including 11 children, and wounded 24 at a school in Russia, investigators have said.

The attacker, a man in his early thirties who was named by authorities as Artem Kazantsev, killed two security guards and then opened fire on students and teachers at School Number 88 in Izhevsk, where he had once been a pupil. He then killed himself.

The motive for the shooting in the capital of the Udmurtia region which is about 600 miles east of Moscow, was unclear. 

In videos shared online, children are seen hiding in classrooms and running out of the building as authorities intervene.

Russia’s investigative committee, which handles major crimes, said it was looking into the perpetrator’s suspected neo-Nazi links.

"News that a coalition led by the Brothers of Italy is poised to win power in Italy has been greeted with delight by other European far-right parties, warnings from political moderates - and an expression of profound alarm from the leading Italian writer Roberto Saviano.

Giorgia Meloni’s nationalist party, which has neofascist origins, appeared well positioned to give Italy its first far-right-led government since the second world war.

Leader of France's far-right party, Marine Le Pen, tweeted: “The Italian people have decided to take its destiny in hand by electing a patriotic and sovereignist government. Congratulations to Giorgia Meloni and [League leader] Matteo Salvini for having resisted the threats of an anti-democratic and arrogant European Union by winning this great victory.”

"“The clothing that’s available on the market assumes a very binary world,"" says Wandia Gichuru, CEO of Kenyan fashion brand Vivo.

Alongside Bold Network Africa, the brand has released a vibrant genderless clothing collection called Zoya X Bold. It is one of a new crop of collaborations showcasing androgynous fashion.

LGBTQ+ activist Chris “Makena Njeri” Muriithi, CEO of Bold Network Africa – which describes itself as a queer storytelling platform – says that fashion needs to be more inclusive. “For the longest time, I had to go to the men’s section to even buy a shirt,” says Muriithi, who is non-binary.

“I was bullied on social media for how I used to dress just because it did not conform with what society has shown people to be the norm,” says Muriithi.

Kenya’s queer community has been increasingly visible over the past few years, after a number of prominent Kenyans came out publicly. Celebrities such as Willis Chimano of Afropop band Sauti Sol, challenge traditional gender dressing with crop tops, low V-necks, bare backs and bodysuits. YouTuber Jayson Wamae also embraces fashion fluidity, dressing in anything from sheer tops and silk jumpsuits to neck scarves.

Muriithi says: “People need to be able to be who they are without having to be afraid.” But LGBTQ+ people face systemic discrimination and violence in Kenya, and gender non-conforming people face heightened threats.

In April, a 25-year-old non-binary lesbian was murdered in a suspected hate crime. The following month, a 50-year-old intersex person was raped and killed. Figures by the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission suggest that these are not isolated incidents.

Ashton Laurence – pictured above – who modelled the new line, faces harassment daily but does not shy away from growing out his hair, wearing eyeliner and mesh vests. It is an ode to his younger self, who he describes as a feminine boy.

“I didn’t see a lot of people like me growing up in Nairobi, so I want to be that person for others,” says Laurence.

"This isn't a small island. 
This is the village of Gabarun in Nigeria's northern Jigawa State - almost entirely surrounded by flood water from the Hedejia River.

The country is currently battling its worst floods in a decade with more than 300 people killed this year alone - with authorities saying earlier this week that the situation is “beyond our control.”

The floods in 27 of Nigeria’s 36 states and capital city have affected half a million people, including 100,000 displaced and more than 500 injured, Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency said on Tuesday.

The disaster has also destroyed thousands of hectares of farmland, worsening fears of a disruption of food supply in Africa’s most populous country. 

Nigeria sees flooding every year, often as a result of non-implementation of environmental guidelines and inadequate infrastructure. Authorities are blaming the floods this year on water overflowing from local rivers, unusual rainfalls and the release of excess water from Lagdo dam in neighbouring Cameroon’s northern region.

The floods have also destroyed crops, mostly in Nigeria’s northern region, which produces much of what the country eats, raising concerns that they could further affect food supplies already disrupted by armed conflict in the country’s north-west and central regions.

In the Benue state, Aondongu Kwagh-bee, 30, said he visited his rice farm recently and discovered that a heavy downpour had “wiped away everything.

“Right now, there is nothing there. Just sand filled up and the rice has been washed away.""

That’s what Dr Tom Roa, an iwi kaumātua (elder) and academic said about a Māori tribe landmark settlement that just took place in New Zealand’s House of Representatives.

After decades of fighting for reparations, the Ngāti Maniapoto iwi (tribe) has finally secured a long-awaited apology and millions of dollars in redress for atrocities committed by the crown, including for its “indiscriminate” killings and “massive” alienation of tribal land.

As well as an apology, the Waikato-based iwi of nearly 46,000 members received NZ$177m in financial redress – New Zealand’s fifth-largest sum of its kind – and the return of 36 sites of cultural significance.

The public gallery was full of members of the iwi, who had travelled for nine hours to witness the Maniapoto claims settlement bill become law.

"“Women, life, freedom”

These are the words heard at Mahsa Amini’s funeral, which have been repeated by protesters across Iran, including in a video which shows young women burning their hijabs while male protesters fight off security forces.

Mahsa Amini​, 22, ​was detained ​by morality police ​on 16 September for allegedly wearing a hijab headscarf in an “improper” way. Activists said the woman, whose Kurdish first name is Jhina, had suffered a fatal blow to the head, a claim denied by officials, who have announced an investigation. Police continue to maintain that she died of natural causes, but her family suspect that she was subjected to beating and tortur​e.

Iran has​ now​ shut off the internet in parts of Tehran and Kurdistan and blocked access to platforms such as Instagram and WhatsApp in an attempt to curb a growing protest movement that has relied on social media to document dissent.

Iranian state media reported that by Wednesday street rallies had spread to 15 cities, with police using teargas and making arrests to disperse crowds of up to 1,000 people.​ ​On Thursday, protesters torched police stations and vehicles in several cities.​ ​
This comes as anti-regime demonstrations spilled into cyberspace, with videos of women burning their hijabs going viral. Other women have been posting emotional videos in which they cut their hair in protest under the hashtag #Mahsa_Amini.

"“Chris was a big brother, he had a fiancee, he was a dad to be. He had so much going for him … which makes this tragedy all the more worse.”

The family of Chris Kaba have reiterated their call for “justice” after being shown the bodycam footage of his shooting during a meeting with the new commissioner of the Metropolitan police.

Kaba, an unarmed black man, was killed on 5 September after a police pursuit of his car which ended in Streatham Hill, south London. His Audi was hemmed in by two police vehicles in Kirkstall Gardens, a narrow residential street, and one round was fired from a police weapon.

The Met police officer involved has been suspended by the force and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating. In a statement, the IOPC said it would “explore all of the circumstances” surrounding the death of the 24-year-old father-to-be, including whether “race influenced any actions taken by the police”.

Following a meeting with the Met police commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, and the IOPC director general on Wednesday, Kaba’s mother, Helen Nkama, said: “It was hard … very hard ... As I’ve said before, my heart is already broken. What I want is justice for my son and I want the truth.”

Jefferson Bosela, Kaba’s cousin who was also at the meeting, said: “It was hard, but the family just wants justice. For now, the family are going to take a break and take a step back.” We spoke to Bosela, who has been acting as the family’s spokesperson, a few days before the meeting - you can watch the video in full and read more via the link our bio.

"The Ukrainian president has shrugged off Russian moves to escalate the conflict and threats of nuclear war, saying his country’s forces would continue their counteroffensive, not giving Russia breathing space to mobilise and dig in on Ukrainian soil.

“We can return the Ukrainian flag to our entire territory. We can do it with the force of arms, but we need time,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a recorded broadcast to the UN general assembly on Wednesday.

Security forces detained more than 1,300 people in Russia overnight at protests denouncing mobilisation, a rights group said, hours after Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s first military draft since the second world war.

"Anti-war protests have erupted across Russian cities after Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation in Russia.

Large groups were seen chanting ‘no to war’ and ‘no to mobilisation’ as police violently apprehended the demonstrators.

According to the Russian human rights group OVD-Info, more than 1,300 people have been arrested across the country.

In an anticipated TV address early on Wednesday, the Russian president announced a partial mobilisation and also threatened nuclear retaliation, saying ‘we will use all the means at our disposal’.

His speech came after a rapid reversal in the Kharkiv region, where Ukraine has pushedback Russian forces, claiming to have retaken control of the entire province.

Speaking at the UN general assembly on Tuesday, the secretary general said that “polluters must pay” for the escalating damage caused by heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts, and demanded that it was “high time to put fossil fuel producers, investors and enablers on notice ...

“Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,"" he said adding that: “those funds should be redirected in two ways – to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.”

"Vladimir Putin has announced a partial mobilisation in Russia in a significant escalation that places the country’s people and economy on a wartime footing.

The president also threatened nuclear retaliation, saying Moscow had “lots of weapons” to reply to what he called western threats on its territory and added that he was not bluffing.

In a highly anticipated televised address, Putin said this was a direct response to the dangers posed by the west that “wants to destroy our country” and claimed the west had tried to “turn Ukraine’s people into cannon fodder”.

Putin’s decision has sent shockwaves across Russia. Since the start of the invasion, the Russian president has sought to shield his population from the grim realities of war, with the Kremlin eager to cultivate a sense of normality on the streets of Moscow and other major cities.

But with the decision to announce a partial mobilisation and the call-up of 300,000 mostly young Russian men, the war will now enter the household of many families across the country.

"Will anybody be held accountable for the Champions League chaos?

On 28 May 2022, the final between Real Madrid and Liverpool took place at the Stade de France in Paris. But the showpiece match between two great clubs was disfigured by chaotic organisation, in which Liverpool supporters suffered a near disaster and as riot police teargassed spectators while failing to protect people from violent attacks by local thugs.

Yet the French government, police and Uefa united instantly to put the blame on Liverpool supporters, claiming that the problems were caused by thousands seeking entry with fake tickets. Echoes of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, in which 97 people were unlawfully killed but the South Yorkshire police falsely blamed Liverpool supporters, were inescapable.

Uefa has issued a “sincere apology” to spectators “who had to experience or witness frightening and distressing events”, but has not admitted to any failings or retracted its statements blaming Liverpool supporters.

Two official reports in France have severely criticised the police operation but not contested the official claims of “industrial scale” ticket fraud.

"Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old from Iran’s Kurdistan province, fell into a coma and died following her arrest in Tehran last week by the morality police for “unsuitable attire,” sparking nationwide anger and demonstrations in numerous areas, including the capital.

In the Kurdish region, the rights organisation Hengaw said there were protests in 13 cities on Monday and that 250 people had been arrested. Hengaw gave the names of three people who it said had been killed during protests in three different cities, including Amini’s hometown of Saqez. There was not official confirmation of the deaths. The reports could not be immediately independently verified.

Videos posted on social media have shown demonstrations in numerous cities, with women waving their headscarves and protesters facing off with security forces.

The news comes weeks after Iran’s hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, ordered a crackdown on women’s rights and called for stricter enforcement of the country’s mandatory dress code, which has required all women to wear the hijab head-covering since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

Iranian media is now rife with debate about the accountability of the morality police.

The police deny beating Amini, and it was claimed by the interior ministry that she collapsed due to a heart condition. But her father has repeatedly said his daughter had no health problems, adding that she had suffered bruises to her legs. He held the police responsible for her death.

On Monday, the Tehran police commander described her death as an “unfortunate” incident, while rejecting what he said were “cowardly accusations” against the police.

Several landslides had been reported, government officials said. The storm forced the closure of roads while a highway bridge in Utuado town in the island’s center had been washed away by a flooding river.

The bridge, installed in the area after Hurricane Maria devastated the region five years ago, can be heard to collapse with a sickening crash in the rising water. Critics say the total blackout show that authorities have learnt nothing since the 2017 hurricanes.

"Prince George, nine, and Princess Charlotte, seven, have taken a prominent role at their great grandmother's funeral.

The pair could be seen in a car following the procession with the Queen consort and their mother, the Princess of Wales - and also walked behind the coffin during the Queen's state funeral at Westminster Abbey.

Charlotte’s presence was a reminder of how the Queen’s reign ended hundreds of years of male primogeniture in the British monarchy.

From 2013, a younger son could no longer displace an elder daughter in the line of succession, meaning that Charlotte is third in line to the throne and her younger brother, Louis, who was not at the funeral, is fourth.

After the funeral, a procession travelled behind the Queen's coffin to the Wellington Arch. After the pomp and almost continual musical accompaniment of earlier, the national anthem was played for a final time, and a royal salute was given as the hearse departed to Windsor Castle.

The committal service will begin at 4pm at St George's Chapel, Windsor, before the Queen is lowered into the royal vault, where she will lay to rest alongside her husband and parents.

King Charles III and his three younger siblings, Anne, Andrew and Edward, led the procession, followed by Charles's sons, Princes William and Harry, and other senior members of the royal family.

Speaking to the 2,000-strong congregation, which included royalty, world leaders and members of the British establishment, Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, said during the service: “People of loving service are rare in any walk of life. Leaders of loving service are still rarer. But in all cases those who serve will be loved and remembered when those who cling to power and privileges are long forgotten.”

The Queen’s coffin will now be transferred to Windsor Castle, where there will be a committal service in St George’s Chapel. She will be buried in the castle’s King George VI Memorial Chapel, alongside her father, her mother, and her sister’s ashes.

The coffin of her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year, will also be moved from the royal vault in St George’s Chapel to be interred with the Queen, as the couple requested.

"“I was labelled outrageous because I fell in love with a woman.”

In a memoir Anne Heche worked on over the past year, the late actor shared candid thoughts on her relationship with Ellen DeGeneres in the late 1990s, when they were among Hollywood’s first openly gay couples.

In her lifetime, Heche said that she was effectively blacklisted by the industry because of her relationship with DeGeneres, who around the same time made television history by having her character in the sitcom Ellen come out as gay. The couple dated between 1997 and 2000.

“I did not, personally, identify as a lesbian. I simply fell in love! It was, to be clear, as odd to me as anyone else. There were no words to describe how I felt,” Heche wrote in her upcoming book, which is a sequel to her 2001 memoir Call Me Crazy.

Heche, whose films included Donnie Brasco and Wag the Dog, died in August at 53, a week after crashing her car into a house in Los Angeles. Her death was ruled an accident by the coroner.

“As many of you know, the past three years have presented me with challenges in the form of injuries and surgeries. I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form. But I also know my body’s capacities and limits, and its message to me lately has been clear ... Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognise when it is time to end my competitive career.

""The last 24 years on Tour have been an incredible adventure. While it sometimes feels like it went by in 24 hours, it has also been so deep and magical that it seems as if I’ve already lived a full lifetime.”

Unlike his siblings, who wore ceremonial military uniforms, Prince Andrew, who became a “non-working royal” after the scandal of his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein the convicted sex offender, wore a morning suit adorned with honours including the South Atlantic medal, a reminder of his military service in the 1982 Falklands war.

The Queen’s grandsons followed the same route down the Mall and Whitehall 25 years ago when as children they followed their mother’s coffin on foot to her funeral after she was killed in a car crash in Paris. On that day, Prince Harry was 12 and William 15.

The Duke of Sussex wore morning dress as a result of protocol that non-working royals cannot wear military uniforms at such public occasions. Reporting of that fact appeared to irk the duke and a spokesperson for him issued a statement late on Tuesday that appeared to ask the press to stop talking about it.

“His decade of military service is not determined by the uniform he wears and we respectfully ask that focus remain on the life and legacy of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,” they said. The duke served as an army captain and was deployed on two tours of Afghanistan.

"""Yes this looks grim. Very grim. But it is still not too late for action!""

The climate crisis has driven the world to the brink of multiple “disastrous” tipping points, according to a major study, which was largely unreported following the news of the Queen's death.

According to the analysis, published in the journal Science last week, we are well on our way to 1.5C of global heating. The work also highlights five dangerous tipping points may already have been passed due to the 1.1C of warming caused by humanity to date.

Here our @guardianaustralia cartoonist, @firstdogonthemoon lays what exactly these are.

"Exclusive: Dozens of Clarence House staff have been given notice of their redundancy as the offices of King Charles and the Queen Consort move to Buckingham Palace after the death of the Queen, the Guardian has learned.

Up to 100 employees at the King’s former official residence, including some who have worked there for decades, received notification that they could lose their jobs just as they were working round the clock to smooth his elevation to the throne.

Private secretaries, the finance office, the communications team and household staff are among those who received notice during the thanksgiving service for the Queen, at St Giles’ Cathedral in Edinburgh on Monday, that their posts were on the line.

Many staff had assumed they would be amalgamated into the King’s new household, claiming they were given no indication of what was coming until the letter from Sir Clive Alderton, the King’s top aide, arrived. One source said: “Everybody is absolutely livid, including private secretaries and the senior team. All the staff have been working late every night since Thursday, to be met with this. People were visibly shaken by it.”

"'I can't bear this bloody thing!'

King Charles became annoyed with a leaking pen during a visit to Northern Ireland's Hillsborough Castle.

Charles, alongside the Queen Consort, Camilla, was attending a reception at the castle today, where he met with members of Northern Ireland's assembly.

During a book-signing ceremony towards the end of visit, Charles realised he had initially signed the wrong date and then complained about the pen he was using, with the Queen Consort saying it was leaking 'everywhere'. 

The pen was swiftly vanished by a royal aide before Camilla sat down to sign the book herself.

"""It was ludicrous""

In London, Paul Powlesland, a barrister and climate activist who had held up a blank piece of paper near parliament, said he had been threatened with arrest by a police officer if he added the words 'Not my King' to his sign.

Civil liberties campaigners and others have expressed alarm about the response of police to anti-monarchy protesters after a number of incidents, one of which included the arrest and subsequent de-arrest of Symon Hill for shouting, 'Who elected him?' when the proclamation of King Charles III was read out in Oxford.

Powlesland told the Guardian on Monday night that he had had quite a long discussion with the police who had stopped him, who were from Norfolk’s force. “Normally, you can get into trouble for shouting, but if you have something written that is super-factual and which is not abusive, then you would normally think that you are protected. It’s pure free speech.""

“I think the idea that he could arrest me and that there could be a conviction under the Public Order Act was ludicrous, but interventions like that are having a chilling effect,” Powlesland added.

The Metropolitan police on Monday night appeared to acknowledge the reaction to Powlesland’s tweets after they had gone viral, issuing a statement saying it was was aware of video showing an officer speaking to a member of the public at the Palace of Westminster.

“The public absolutely have a right to protest and we have been making this clear to all officers involved in the extraordinary policing operation currently in place and we will continue to do so,” said the deputy assistant commissioner, Stuart Cundy.

"In a lightning offensive over the last few days, Ukrainian forces have recaptured the majority of Russian-occupied territory in the Kharkiv region.

Videos have since been emerging on social media of locals celebrating in several locations. On Sunday, the district mayor of Derhachi, north of the city of Kharkiv, released footage of himself ripping a Russian flag in two after liberating the village of Kozacha Lopan, which had been occupied by invading forces for six months. The Derhachi district includes several satellite towns of Kharkiv city and stretches up to the Russian border.

Ukraine’s gains over the weekend have inflicted an extraordinary defeat on Moscow, prompting the Russian army to pull back thousands of troops after suffering a series of battlefield defeats.

But Russian strikes have now knocked out power and water to much of the Kharkiv region, plunging its cities into darkness and cutting power in hospitals in what Ukraine described as an act of “revenge” by Russia for its recent battlefield successes.

"The family of Chris Kaba has called for the immediate suspension of the Metropolitan police officer involved in his fatal shooting.

The 24-year-old, who was due to become a father for the first time, was shot dead by a firearms officer in Streatham, south London, on Monday night.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has since launched a homicide investigation into his death, yet the Met is yet to confirm if any of those involved have been disciplined.

On Saturday, thousands of protesters marched through Whitehall demanding justice for Kaba.

The rapper Stormzy was among those to address the crowd, calling on people to “have stamina” in the campaign for justice.

Kaba was driving an Audi, which was reportedly rammed and boxed in by police on Monday night. He was said to have been killed by a single shot fired through the driver’s side of the windscreen of the car.

His family has called for the officer who fired the shot to face suspension. 

After the opening of the IOPC homicide investigation, the family has also demanded the Met release video from body-worn cameras from the officers showing the moment that they shot him.

After enjoying markedly good health for so long, the oldest monarch in British history had recently appeared more fragile. She had understandably become a more private woman since the death of Prince Philip last year and had been less publicly visible, undertaking lighter duties. All of us knew that this moment was approaching.“

“It arrives nevertheless as a national shock, but also as a shared moment of reflection, and as the start of a new and unwritten chapter for the British monarchy and the country itself.

"""It's worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change"" - Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022

Queen Elizabeth has died at the age of 96. Ascending to the throne at the age of just 25 in 1952, she would go on to become the longest-reigning monarch in British history. 

Elizabeth's reign spanned a period of major political change for the UK including decolonisation, the Troubles, and Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. She also endured familial upheaval with the breakdown of her children's marriages, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from their role as senior royals.

"Breaking: Queen Elizabeth II, the longest-reigning monarch in British history, has died at the age of 96.

Prince Charles, 73, heir to the throne since the age of three, is now king, and will be officially proclaimed so at St James’s Palace in London as soon as practicably possible.

In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: “The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon. The King and the Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.”

Flags on landmark buildings in Britainwere being lowered to as a period of official mourning was announced.

As Queen of the UK and 14 other realms, and head of the 54-nation Commonwealth, Elizabeth II was easily the world’s most recognisable head of state during an extraordinarily long reign.

Coming to the throne at the age of 25, she successfully steered the monarchy through decades of turbulent change, with her personal popularity providing ballast during the institution’s more difficult times.

Fifteen prime ministers served her, attesting to her deep knowledge, experience of world affairs and mastery of political neutrality. They stretched back to Sir Winston Churchill, who was still prime minister when she assumed the throne, with resolve and far earlier than she had expected, on the premature death of her father, George VI, in 1952.

As many nations today mourn a queen, one family is mourning a mother of four, a grandmother of eight, and a great-grandmother of 12.

"""For us, it is totally racist and criminal and we want all the community, especially the minority community, to see this as a racism case.""

These are the words of Prosper Kaba, the father of Chris Kaba, 24, who was shot dead by police in south London on Monday night.

Kaba's family have called for a homicide investigation as it was revealed that a search of the scene had found no gun linked to their son.

Kaba was driving a car which was first rammed before being boxed in by police. He was killed by a single shot that entered through the driver’s side of the windscreen of the Audi. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the car Kaba was in had triggered an intelligence system indicating it was linked to a firearms incident days earlier, which led police to chase and then force the vehicle to stop.

Mr Kaba, who was due to become a father, was a rapper known as Madix or Mad Itch and was part of the MOBO-nominated drill group 67.

On Wednesday, family and friends paid tribute to the “kind” and “happy” 24-year-old. Kim Alleyne, 49, whose daughter Karimah Waite was engaged to Kaba, said: “He was so loved. He was so funny. He was super-kind. Crazy. He was always happy. He would do anything for you.”

She added: “He was a fiance, he was due to get married in five months’ time. He’s got a baby on the way that he’s never going to see. It’s horrible and so shocking and so sad.”

The Met’s commander, Alexis Boon, expressed sympathy to Kaba’s family for the “devastating and lasting impact this tragic incident will have on them”. He added: “I understand that this incident is extremely concerning and I would like to reassure the community that the Met is cooperating fully with the Independent Office for Police Conduct.

“I also recognise that the family and community want answers about what happened. I know the IOPC investigators are working hard to establish the facts, but also need some time and space to be able to progress their inquiries.”",2022-09-08 17:48:13

"The official portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama have been unveiled at the White House in an emotional and overdue ceremony.

Customarily, a former president returns for the unveiling during the tenure of his successor. But the Obamas did not have their ceremony while Donald Trump was in office.

Speaking after his portrait was unveiled, Barack thanked the artists Robert McCurdy and Sharon Sprung.

On McCurdy’s photorealistic painting style, Obama noted how “he captures every wrinkle of your face, every crease of your shirt, [and] you’ll note he refused all of my requests to make my ears smaller,” he said.

“He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way,” Obama added to laughter and applause, a nod to the social media firestorm that occurred when he wore such a suit in 2014.

Meanwhile, Michelle hailed the portraits as a reminder of American opportunity, saying “there’s a place for everyone in this country”. “If the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world,” she said, “it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can too.”‪

"“Without any action, it is all meaningless.”

In 2019, Zumrat Dawut and her family fled China for the US after she spent more than two months in a detention camp in the region of Xinjiang, where she says she was shackled, interrogated, beaten and forcibly sterilised.

Dawut, an outspoken advocate for Uyghur victims of oppression, has told her story again and again – and is now speaking out once more in the hope of spurring global action.

Last week, the UN high commissioner for human rights, released a long-awaited report on abuses in Xinjiang. The 45-page document was published years after the world first learned of a huge crackdown on Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, including mass detention, re-education, and religious and cultural oppression.

From the time of receiving the first notifications to publication, the report took half a decade to compile. It determined that the Chinese government had been committing long-running human rights abuses against Uyghur and other ethnic Muslim minorities, likely to the level of crimes against humanity.

The report demolished Beijing’s counter-terrorism framework, which it used to justify the crackdown in Xinjiang, and found credible evidence of torture and assault, mass arbitrary detention, forced medical procedures and “credible indications” of coerced family planning, including forced sterilisation.

Victims and rights groups had feared a watered-down report – and have since criticised UN for failing to label the treatment as genocide.

As the report was released, Dawut was protesting alongside other Uyghur exiles in Washington DC. “The report was all we could think about,” Dawut said via video link. “We were eager to find out about how reflective it would be about what has happened to our people. Any kind of crime you can think of is happening to Uyghurs.”

The Chinese government has named Dawut in press conferences, releasing personal information and photos, and calling her a liar. She – like many others – has cut off contact with loved ones for their protection.

As Chilean president Gabriel Boric gave a speech imploring people to vote in support of major progressive changes to the country's constitution, a young boy dressed as superman stole the show.

The boy, who is reportedly in the foster care of Boric's mother, appears to have no idea about the significance of the speech going on. 

The viral clip was recorded last week before Chileans voted against the new constitution which had been drafted to replace the 1980 document written under Gen Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship.

It enshrined gender parity across government and other organs of the state – for the first time anywhere in the world – prioritised environmental protection and recognised Chile’s Indigenous peoples for the first time in the country’s history.

Many criticised the document’s guarantees for Indigenous people, which they said would divide Chile. Others warned that the shakeup of the political system was unnecessary and experimental.

Chilean-American novelist Ariel Dorfman writes: ""It was the most ecologically advanced such founding document in world history, granting personhood to nature, protecting rivers and air and forests. 

""It extended democracy, established gender parity and popular participation, granted Indigenous peoples the recognition they had been denied for centuries, lovingly answered the need for universal health care, decent education and pension funds, access to water, sovereignty over mineral resources, the care for animals and children – things that generations of Chileans have been fighting for.""

'I remember my sister and I hanging on to dear life, while my mother held my other sister tightly in her arms with her rosary beads praying... I remember how my face almost hit the ocean as our boat rocked so hard from the storm.'

She also described living for ‘years’ in refugee camps before being accepted to resettle in Australia.

Le went on to speak of her feelings of ‘gratitude and freedom’ at coming to live in the country.

'This migration story belongs to all of us. It’s our story, and we can all be proud to share it.'

Le, who represents the culturally diverse but low income area of Fowler, went on to criticise that her western Sydney community was subjected to more harsh conditions by the state government than wealthier areas in the city’s eastern suburbs during the 2021 lockdowns.

She said her community were 'the forgotten people, and yet we are the backbone of Australia.'

"In a post-Roe America, would you trust a period tracker?

Nearly a third of American women use period tracking apps, according to a 2019 survey published by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

They have helped make women’s lives easier in many ways, from family planning and detecting early signs of health issues to choosing their preferred time for a holiday.

However, many women in the US have been deleting their apps amid fears of their data being used against them in criminal cases in states where abortion is illegal.

Period tracking apps tend to collect all of data from their users. Flo, one of the most popular period tracking apps in the US, has come under fire in the past for sharing its users data after a Wall Street Journal investigation found that the app informed Facebook when a user was on their period or if they intended to get pregnant.

That said, privacy experts believe that it's still possible for these apps to change their ways.

""They should never have owned so much data in the first place. If they adopted practices like storing data locally and minimizing the data to what’s strictly necessary we wouldn’t be having this debate now. It’s not too late for them to do the right thing,” said Eva Blum-Dumontet, a tech policy consultant.

Until then, experts believe that the risk in using third-party period tracking apps remain.

According to Jonathan Lord, UK medical director for MSI Reproductive Choices, the danger will persist until “we treat abortion like all other healthcare – regulated like all other medical procedures, but not criminalized”.

"Down in the ocean's shadowy depths, this fish gazes up towards the surface through its transparent head with eyes like mesmerising emerald orbs ...

These domes are huge spherical lenses that sit on a pair of long, silvery eye tubes – hence its common name, the barreleye fish.

The green tint of this fish’s eyes acts almost like sunglasses, helping it track down its prey in the ocean water above it.

With nowhere to hide in the open waters of the deep ocean, many animals living there have glowing bellies that help erase their shadow - bioluminescent prey are hard to spot against the dim blue sunlight trickling down. But barreleyes are one step ahead.

Their eye pigment allows the fish to distinguish between sunlight and bioluminescence, says Bruce Robison, deep-sea biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California.

While they appear to constantly be looking up, barrel-eye fish can also rotate their eyes to track their prey through the water until they’re right in front of their mouths.

So, how easy is it to encounter barreleyes in the wild? Unsurprisingly, not very.

World leaders have expressed increasing alarm at Europe's largest nuclear plant becoming a war zone. Any radiation leak could be catastrophic for Ukraine and the wider continent.

Kyiv says Russian forces are using the plant as a shield, hiding military equipment there knowing that they cannot be targeted. Moscow claims Ukraine is shelling the plant and its surroundings.

"""I don’t want to go into my job and feel violated.”

When Grace Velez went to work wearing pigtails, she expected a typical shift.

Instead, she received lots of sexualised comments from male customers and unwarranted winks, and went home with double the number of tips she usually gets. 

Eventually, @_gracevv realised that the new hairstyle might have something to do with it.

After sharing her story on TikTok, Grace inspired the ""pigtail experiment"", in which women shared their experiences of being sexualised while wearing pigtails in the service industry.

“I think there needs to be more awareness and protection around the fetishisation of women at work,” says Grace.

Watch our video to hear from Grace on exactly how she started the pigtail experiment – and the responses she received.

More than 1,100 people have been killed in Pakistan this summer, one-third of the country is under water, millions of acres of crops have been wiped out, and nearly 33 million people in one of the world’s most populous nations have so far been affected. 

""The rains continue, and the numbers are sure to rise,"" writes John Vidal in our environment newsletter, Down to Earth, on how Pakistan warned the world of their coming floods, but were ignored.

""With thousands of fast-melting Himalayan glaciers in its north at risk of bursting glacial lakes and releasing billions of cubic metres of water, and increasingly erratic monsoons and cyclones sweeping up from its coast to the south, Pakistan has been a climate catastrophe waiting to happen.

"The world is in the grip of an unprecedented hunger crisis.

The United Nations said last month that the number of people going hungry in the world had risen by 150 million since the start of the Covid pandemic.

There are growing concerns that the food crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will push the worst-hit countries into famine.

“We thought it couldn’t get any worse. But this war has been devastating,” says David Beasley, director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP).

“The result will be global destabilisation, starvation, and mass migration on an unprecedented scale,” he warned. “We have to act today to avert this looming catastrophe.”

But there are fears that the humanitarian sector won’t be able to give enough aid to countries because of the lack of funding from donor countries.

WFP’s spokesman for east Africa, Michael Dunford, said he thought there had been learnings from past hunger crises but “we haven’t been able to implement it to the extent required because of the lack of funding.”

"Mikhail Gorbachev, who ended the cold war without bloodshed but failed to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union, has died at the age of 91, Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday.

Gorbachev’s office said earlier that he was undergoing treatment at the hospital.

Gorbachev, the last Soviet president, forged arms reduction deals with the United States and partnerships with western powers to remove the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe since the second world war and bring about the reunification of Germany.

When pro-democracy protests swept across the Soviet bloc nations of communist Eastern Europe in 1989, Gorbachev refrained from using force unlike previous Kremlin leaders who had sent tanks to crush uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, Reuters reports.

But the protests fuelled aspirations for autonomy in the 15 republics of the Soviet Union, which disintegrated over the next two years in chaotic fashion.

On becoming general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in 1985, aged just 54, he had set out to revitalise the system by introducing limited political and economic freedoms, but his reforms spun out of control.

His policy of “glasnost” - free speech - allowed previously unthinkable criticism of the party and the state, but also emboldened nationalists who began to press for independence in the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and elsewhere.

Gorbachev spent much of the last two decades on the political periphery, intermittently calling for the Kremlin and the White House to mend ties as tensions soared to Cold War levels since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and launched an offensive in Ukraine earlier this year, AFP reports.

He spent the twilight years of his life in and out of hospital with increasingly fragile health and observed self-quarantine during the pandemic as a precaution against coronavirus.

"“What you see today is just a trailer of what’s in store for us with poverty, hunger, malnutrition and disease if we don’t pay heed to climate change,” said development and climate expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh.

Record-breaking floods in Pakistan have killed more than 1,150 people since mid-June. Large areas remain underwater and more than 33 million people, or one in seven Pakistanis, have been affected by the floods.

Pakistan has more glaciers (7,532) than anywhere else outside the polar regions - making it one of the countries most exposed to extreme weather.

The UN is appealing for a $160m in emergency funding for the nearly half a million people displaced, while the International Monetary Fund’s approved the release of a $1.7bn bailout.

Since Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidency came to an abrupt end in July as he fled abroad and resigned in disgrace, accused of bankrupting Sri Lanka, lawyers, activists and victims around the world have swung into action.

The nation is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948 - with massive political upheaval, widespread protests and shortages of basic necessities, including food, fuel and medicine.

"""The reality is life is going to get a lot more harsh.""

Even in a year where energy prices have dominated the news agenda, this is a significant day: Ofgem, the UK industry regulator, is due to announce a change to the energy price cap – with prices expected to go up from October to an annual maximum of more than £3,500. That number could be a staggering £5,300 by the new year.

For almost anyone, those prices will make a difference to their standard of living. But for the most vulnerable, such exorbitant costs will have a profound impact, and in many cases make an already difficult situation impossible.

Since June, the Guardian’s we've been hearing from some of those at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis, contributors to the Guardian’s heat or eat diaries, about the struggles they are already facing – and their fears for the immediate future.

"Ancient dinosaur footprints dating back more than 100m years have been revealed in Texas.

Multiple tracks belonging to the Acrocanthosaurus dinosaur were discovered recently at Dinosaur Valley state park in north-west Texas as widespread droughts have caused a river running through central Texas to dry up almost entirely.

The 15ft, seven-ton creature once inhabited the area over 113m years ago, confirmed the state park in an email to NBC News.

About 60 prints from the Acroanthosaurus have been revealed, with an estimated 149 tracks from the dinosaur in total, the BBC reported.

Tracks from the Acrocanthosaurus had not been seen since 2000, with the prints hidden under layers of water and sediment, though visitors can sometimes see other dinosaur tracks at the state park depending on weather conditions, according to the park’s website.

Prints from the Sauroposeidon, a 66ft creature that once weighed about 48 tons when fully matured, were also discovered. Experts believe that the Acrocanthosaurus preyed on Sauroposeidon, explaining why their prints were discovered together.

Depleting water levels have uncovered other discoveries besides dinosaur prints. In Lake Mead, human remains and a ship dating back to the second world war were discovered as water levels fell during the longstanding drought.

"What happens when we outsource part of our memory to an external device?

Does it enable us to squeeze more and more out of life, because we aren’t as reliant on our fallible brains to cue things up for us? Are we so reliant on smartphones that they will ultimately change how our memories work (sometimes called digital amnesia)? Or do we just occasionally miss stuff when we don’t remember the reminders?

Our brains and our smartphones form a complex web of interactions: the smartphonification of life has been rising since the mid 2000s, but was accelerated by the pandemic, as was internet use in general.

Prolonged periods of stress, isolation and exhaustion – common themes since March 2020 – are well known for their impact on memory. Of those surveyed by memory researcher Catherine Loveday in 2021, 80% felt that their memories were worse than before the pandemic.

We are – still – shattered, not just by Covid-19, but also by the miserable national and global news cycle. Many of us self-soothe with distractions like social media. Meanwhile, endless scrolling can, at times, create its own distress, and phone notifications and self interrupting to check for them, also seem to affect what, how and if we remember.

"“I am human. And I too sometimes long for joy, light and fun amidst these dark clouds.""

Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, fought back tears today as she gave a forceful defence of her work record and her right to a private life following recent criticisms she has faced over a leaked video of her partying.

The clips, which were leaked last week, showed her dancing exuberantly with friends and drinking at a party at which unsubstantiated reports claimed drugs may have been circulating.

Marin, 36, who was delivering a speech at her Social Democratic Party's (SDP) event in Lahti city, north of Helsinki, also apologised for the second time in a week yesterday after a photograph of two topless women taken at a party inside the Finnish prime minister’s official residence last month was published on social media.

Following the video leak, the prime minister volunteered for a drugs test “for my own legal protection and to clear up any doubts”. She passed. But in the fallout of the ""scandal"", Guardian columnist Arwa Mahdawi has called into question the apparent sexist double standards at play.

""While Boris Johnson having multiple children with numerous women is dismissed as boys will be boys, a woman having fun at home with her friends is treated like an untrustworthy hedonist,"" writes Mahdawi.

"Many travellers trek to remote destinations in search of the perfect picture.
But at what cost?

When photographer @natachademahieu arrived at the edge of Obersee, a remote German lake surrounded by lush green mountains and dramatic waterfalls, in August last year she was confronted by the idea of Instagram versus reality.

It was chilly and rain was pelting down, but as tourists came and took photos of themselves against the view, De Mahieu noticed how many would shed their layers in defiance of the cold to convey the image of a blissful summer.

For a photo series as part of a project for her master's degree in documentary photography, De Mahieu went to some of the most geotagged European tourist destinations on Instagram.

Instead of trying to get the perfect shot, she used Photoshop to produce a timelapse collage that showed the reality of all the people who had visited the area over a period of time.

The series, which she calls Theatre of Authenticity, is a commentary on how social media can transform places into must-see destinations – and how an influencer’s Instagram post can open the floodgates.

""I wanted to show the impact of that kind of ‘invisible tourism’ on these places. When I say invisible, I mean that when you’re there you have a feeling that you are alone. But over an hour, or an afternoon, there are a lot of people going there,"" she says.

For example, De Mahieu's image of the Pont d’Arc, a large natural bridge in Ardèche, south-east France, was made from photographs taken over a period of 80 minutes at the height of the tourist season. The final result, made from 100 images, took more than a week to complete.

This is the title sexual assault survivors have given a powerful new exhibit showcasing the outfits they were wearing when they were attacked.

Their aim is to tackle victim-blame culture and to shatter the myth that sexual assault can be attributed to a person's choice in wardrobe.

“I want people to come to a reckoning, that it is not the victim's fault, that it could literally be anyone,” says @amandangocnguyen , one of the survivors behind the exhibit, hosted at the UN headquarters in New York, which invites viewers to guess which outfits are the real ones worn by survivors and which are not.

“But the point of it is that you cannot tell,” she adds.

Nguyen, CEO and founder of @risenow.us and 2019 Nobel peace prize nominee, has fought for years to make sure survivors are protected and taken seriously - especially in the current climate where “rights that have been fought"" are being rolled back. “It is a scary time.

“I want people to know that they're not alone when they walk through the exhibit. Yes, on one hand, it is terrifying to see that so many of us have experienced this horrific act of violence. But on the other hand, I also want people to understand that there is solidarity. And I know that when we work together, we can push for change.”

"‘It’s not you, it’s your car’

The SUV is the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade. It’s also the new target of a group that calls itself the Tyre Extinguishers.

We followed the group on a searingly hot night in New York as its masked members took to the streets of the Upper East Side to take part in the biggest deflation operation yet in the US.

“The amount of damage from a flat tyre is nothing compared to climate change,” said one member as they moved away from the first deflation. “Why do you need an SUV, especially in New York? It’s a vanity thing. You have freedom of choice, sure, but you don’t have freedom from consequences.”

The Tyre Extinguishers movement started in the UK, spread to a clutch of other countries and has now landed in the US. Since June, dozens of SUV and pickup truck owners in New York, the San Francisco Bay area and Chicago have discovered their vehicles with flat tyres along with a note on the windshield declaring: “Your gas guzzler kills.”

The leaflet, complete with a Ghostbusters-style picture of a crossed-out SUV, states the vast amounts of planet-heating emissions generated by the vehicles are “nails in the coffin of our climate”, adding: “You’ll be angry, but don’t take it personally. It’s not you, it’s your car.”

As you might imagine, not everyone is a fan of the activist group. “We need a larger vehicle because I have two sons that are special needs,” explained Quanda Ellis-Walker, who had her tyre deflated in California. “It was terrifying to know that someone would come and do this to you.”

Meanwhile, other critics are less measured with their words. Since hitting the streets the Tyre Extinguishers’ US operation has been flooded with insults and even death threats. One message vowed to “deflate your lungs”.

The death threats aren’t a big concern among the activists however. “People have emailed ‘if you fuck up my SUV I will kill you’, which I get a kick out of, to be honest,” says a member called Alex. “You’re not going to find me. It’s like, why are you so mad?”

"The US actor Anne Heche has died, a week after she was critically injured in a car crash. The news was confirmed by her family, after previously announcing that she would be taken off of life support.

Heche was 53 and had two sons.

Many had hoped Heche would make a recovery after a publicist for the actor reported her in a “stable” condition after crashing her car into a house in Los Angeles on 5 August. Firefighters said she had been speaking to them as she was cut free of the wreckage and taken to hospital.

But the actor shortly afterwards lost consciousness and on 8 August representatives posted an update, saying Heche was in an “extreme critical condition” and had slipped into a coma. On Friday, her family said in a statement that she was not expected to survive and that she was being kept on life support to determine if her organs could be donated.

Heche, an actor of sharp intelligence, rose to prominence in the early 1990s, playing twins on the soap Another World, and with film roles, including the part of Laura in Nicole Holofcener’s debut feature, Walking and Talking.

Her first major role was as Johnny Depp’s girlfriend in gangster drama Donnie Brasco (1997). In the same year she was cast in other enduring titles: political satire Wag the Dog, disaster movie Volcano and slasher classic I Know What You Did Last Summer.

"Author Salman Rushdie has been attacked onstage at an event in New York state.

Rushdie, the author whose writing led to death threats from Iran in the 1980s, was attacked on Friday morning as he was about to give a lecture in western New York.

An Associated Press reporter witnessed a man storm the stage at the Chautauqua Institution and begin punching or stabbing Rushdie as he was being introduced.

The author was taken or fell to the floor, and the man was restrained.

Photos taken by an Associated Press reporter show Rushdie lying flat, with a first responder crouched over him.

Rushdie’s book The Satanic Verses has been banned in Iran since 1988, as many Muslims consider it to be blasphemous.

A year later, Iran’s late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie’s death.

A bounty of more than $3m has also been offered for anyone who kills Rushdie.

Iran’s government has long since distanced itself from Khomeini’s decree, but anti-Rushdie sentiment has lingered.

In 2012, a semi-official Iranian religious foundation raised the bounty for Rushdie from $2.8m to $3.3m.

That year, Rushdie published a memoir, Joseph Anton, about the fatwa.

"""At first glimpse, one would think this is a grey, chaotic city. But grey defines more than just one colour. And São Paulo has many shades of grey.""

With a lack of public spaces in this crowded Brazilian city, conquering new places for pleasure is seen as essential to survive the concrete jungle.

That's perhaps why the Elevado João Goulart, a two-mile viaduct mostly known as the Minhocão – after a legendary monster worm – has become an important meeting point for locals.

Due to its proximity to people’s homes, many complained about the rising car noise in a city where motor transport domination was, and is still, booming.

But at night and on the weekends, the viaduct is opened to pedestrians. With no cars rushing in the upper part, people can walk, run, cycle, skate, or even sunbathe in bikinis, a bit “closer to the sun” – which is likely the reason some call it praia Paulistana – their concrete beach.

Photographer Pablo Albarenga, who moved to São Paulo – the world's fourth most populous city – during the pandemic, says he was: ""caught by the relationship that people had with that huge mass of concrete surrounded by more concrete, shining under the direct sunlight.""

And now after more than 50 years since being planned and built during the Brazilian dictatorship, the viaduct's destiny is still uncertain as it is being taken over by pedestrians. It could be demolished; it could also become a park. Swipe across to read some stories of the Paulistanos' who have adopted this concrete jungle as their oasis.

Coco Gauff has said Serena Williams inspired her to play tennis after the 23-time grand slam champion's decision to 'evolve away' from the sport.

Athletes and commentators around the world have been praising Williams's legacy of 'inspiring and motivating other women in sports'.

But her greatest achievement has nothing to do with Wimbledon, any grand slam or any tennis racket, says sports journalist and former publisher and editor-in-chief of Women in Sport magazine, Natasha Henry.

"Serena Williams has confirmed she will retire from tennis after an era-defining career that has seen her win 23 grand slam singles titles.

The 40-year-old broke the news in an article for Vogue published on Tuesday.

“I have never liked the word retirement,” Williams wrote. “Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”

Williams said her decision had been influenced by the desire to expand her family. She gave birth to her first child, Olympia, in 2017.

“I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair,” Williams wrote. “If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.”

In the article, Williams suggested her final tournament will be the US Open, which starts later this month and runs through to the start of September.

Williams and her sister Venus burst on to the tennis scene as teenagers, shaking up what had been a traditionally white sport. 

Between them, they won 30 grand slam singles titles. They also combined to win 14 major doubles titles. Serena won her last grand slam title at the Australian Open in 2017. She has struggled with injuries in recent years and was beaten in the first round of this summer’s Wimbledon by Harmony Tan.

"Olivia Newton-John, the musical star who found enduring fame for her leading role in the film Grease, has died aged 73.

In a statement posted on social media, her widower John Easterling said: “Dame Olivia Newton-John (73) passed away peacefully at her Ranch in Southern California this morning, surrounded by family and friends. We ask that everyone please respect the family’s privacy during this very difficult time.

""Olivia has been a symbol of triumphs and hope for over 30 years sharing her journey with breast cancer.

“Her healing inspiration and pioneering experience with plant medicine continues with the Olivia Newton-John Foundation Fund, dedicated to researching plant medicine and cancer.”

In 2017, Newton-John revealed the breast cancer she had first suffered in 1992 had returned andhad spread to her spine. She also revealed she’d had a second cancer diagnosis in 2013 but had kept it quiet. She said she believed she would “win over it” and called upon her native Australia to adopt the laws of the US state where she then lived, California, to allow the medicinal use of marijuana.

“My dream is that, in Australia soon, it will be available to all the cancer patients and people going through cancer that causes pain,” she said, adding that though she had moments of despair, she had had “an incredible career” and “nothing to complain about”.

After her first cancer diagnosis, Newton-John became a prominent campaigner, setting up the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Research Centre in Melbourne. Her prominence as an activist for research and better treatment will likely remain as key an element of her legacy as her showbiz career, which included four Grammy wins and the sale of more than 100m records.

"""All they had given her was a plastic bag with her bra and knickers in, that had been cut into pieces where they’d cut the underwear off of her.""

This was part of an interview one mother gave to the BBC's Today programme about the ordeal her 15-year-old daughter faced when strip-searched by Metropolitan police officers.

New data has revealed that 650 children were strip-searched by Met police over a two-year period and the majority were found to be innocent of the suspicions against them.

Olivia, not her real name, was menstruating when she was handcuffed and searched in front of male officers after more than 20 hours in custody.

The incident happened in December 2020, the same month that a 15-year-old black girl known as Child Q was strip-searched while menstruating by Met officers at her school in Hackney, east London.

Following widespread outrage, the children’s commissioner for England launched an investigation – and her report was published today. Dame Rachel de Souza has said she was not convinced that the force was “consistently considering children’s welfare and wellbeing” after the police data showed that in almost a quarter of cases (23%) an appropriate adult was not present during the search, despite this being a requirement under statutory guidance.

“I am also extremely concerned by the ethnic disproportionality shown in these figures, particularly given that ethnicity was determined to be such a key factor in the Child Q case,” De Souza says.

A Met police statement said: “The Metropolitan police is progressing at pace work to ensure children subject to intrusive searches are dealt with appropriately and respectfully. We recognise the significant impact such searches can have.

This is a photo of the Cartwheel Galaxy, which is about 500m light years away from our planet and is 1.5 times the size of our galaxy the Milky Way.

The incredible image was captured by Nasa's triumphant James Webb space telescope – the most powerful space observatory built to date. You can also see two smaller galaxies against a backdrop of many other galaxies.

The Cartwheel, which has been studied by scientists for decades, looks like a wheel because hundreds of millions of years ago, two galaxies collided.

A smaller galaxy plunged through the heart of a large spiral galaxy, creating expanding ripples of star formation.

""The Cartwheel Galaxy sports two rings – a bright inner ring and a surrounding, colourful ring. These two rings expand outwards from the centre of the collision, like ripples in a pond after a stone is tossed into it. Because of these distinctive features, astronomers call this a ‘ring galaxy’, a structure less common than spiral galaxies like our Milky Way,"" says Nasa.

"The science of attribution has delivered a bleak but undeniable picture of how global heating is already bringing death and destruction.

But what about the future?

The devastating intensification of extreme weather is laid bare today in a Guardian analysis that shows how people across the world are losing their lives and livelihoods due to more deadly and more frequent heatwaves, floods, wildfires and droughts brought by the human-driven climate crisis.

@carbonbrief compiled a new database of attribution studies of more than 500 events – every such study available – and shared it exclusively with the Guardian. The analysis – the most comprehensive compilation to date – demonstrates beyond any doubt how humanity’s vast carbon emissions are forcing the climate into disastrous new realms.

At least a dozen of the most serious events, from killer heatwaves to broiling seas, would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating, our research found.

Most worryingly, all this is happening with a rise of just 1C in the planet’s average temperature. The role of global heating in supercharging extreme weather is happening at “astonishing speed”, scientists say.

The world is currently on track for a rise of at least 2.5C.

"From a gummy squirrel to soft coral ...

Scientists have discovered more than 30 potentially new species living at the bottom of the sea.

Researchers from the UK’s Natural History Museum used a remotely operated vehicle to collect specimens from the abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone that extends between Hawaii and Mexico. Previously, creatures from this area had been studied only from photographs.

The animals found include segmented worms, invertebrates from the same family as centipedes, marine animals from the same family as jellyfish, and different types of coral.

The findings have potentially important implications for deep-sea mining, as humans become more interested in exploiting minerals from the seabed, because it seems the activity has the potential to disturb many creatures.

The study’s lead author, Dr Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras, of the Natural History Museum, said: “This research is important not only due to the number of potentially new species discovered, but because these megafauna specimens have previously only been studied from seabed images. Without the specimens and the DNA data they hold, we cannot properly identify the animals and understand how many different species there are.”

The last time any England football team won a major international tournament was in 1966. That was at a time when women were banned from playing competitively in any form.

Last night, it was England's women's team who took the country all the way and brought the silverware home.

As Guardian sportswriter Jonathan Liew writes: ""Now, against the same opponents in the same stadium, English football – all of it, not just half – has ascended to the very top step of the podium.""

He continues: ""As England celebrated, the tableau that greeted us at Wembley would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. Women commentating on television. Women tapping away in the press box. Women officiating, women coaching on the touchline, women bellowing in the stands. Over the last few weeks these sights have become normalised because they are, in fact, normal. The crowds will disperse. The wall of noise will dissolve. But this legacy will remain: a nation slowly being rewired to expect different, to expect better.

""Here was a simple and unremarkable vision of what sport can be, which also acted as a rueful and wistful vision of what sport could have been all these years had the game’s administrators and custodians valued women beyond their ability to bear children and serve tea.""

"Drake has attempted to defend his use of a large private plane for a series of flights that lasted less than 20 minutes – by revealing that the aircraft was being moved to a storage location with no passengers on board.

It comes after a Guardian report highlighted how many celebrities are taking short flights on private jets when cars and public transport are viable options.

Over the past six weeks, Drake’s personal Boeing 767 has taken a seven-minute flight, a 12-minute flight and a 14-minute flight, all between Toronto and nearby Hamilton.

The 14-minute trip burned through 426 gallons of fuel and caused four tons of carbon emissions, which is the same as the total annual carbon footprint of an average person, according to Celebrity Jets, an automated Twitter account that tracks the private flights of the rich and famous.

Responding on Instagram to criticism of these flights, Drake wrote: “This is just them moving planes to whatever airport they are being stored at for anyone who was interested in the logistics … nobody takes that flight.”

While several of Drake’s fans responded with support, arguing that celebrities often move their planes for convenience, others pointed out the pollution from the flight was even more pointless given it didn’t transport anybody.

One reply to Drake stated: “OK but that’s worse, you don’t see how that’s worse?”

Private jets contribute in a relatively small but significant way to the climate crisis, emitting more than 33m tonnes of greenhouse gases, more than the country of Denmark, each year.

Because they carry so few people they are five to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes, per passenger, and 50 times more polluting than trains, researchers have found.

Drake’s empty flights will have been even more carbon intensive, given the lack of people on board.",2022-07-29 23:11:12

"Guardian columnist Owen Jones has written about why it's important we acknowledge and respond to the fact that 98% of those infected with monkeypox by late June were men who have sex with men.

The monkeypox outbreak was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization last week, and countries in Europe have been hit the hardest.

Most patients recover from monkeypox in a few weeks, and an effective vaccine – developed for smallpox – is available in the UK.

The WHO said the outbreak was largely among men who have sex with men who had reported having sex recently with new or multiple partners.

""That so many queer men are haunted by a recent traumatic history is understandable, but the lesson of HIV/Aids is that those most at risk should be protected without stigma. We have the means to squash this outbreak: the greatest enemy is fear,"" @owenjones84 writes.

"An anguished rendering of Canada's national anthem in Cree, by an Indigenous woman with tears streaming down her face, marked one of several emotional moments in the first leg of Pope Francis's apology tour in the country.

The unscripted moment concluded a ceremony fraught with symbolism for thousands of residential school survivors, who sat in sombre silence as Francis said how 'deeply sorry' for the Catholic church's role in Canada's abusive residential school system.

For more than a century, the residential school system forcibly separated more than 150,000 Indigenous children from their families and subjected many to starvation, beatings and sexual abuse in what Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission called 'cultural genocide'.

During the ceremony, Francis lamented the “colonising mentality” behind the system and “catastrophic” effects it had on generations of Indigenous people. “I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the Indigenous peoples,” he said.

"“This should be a moment of global epiphany.”

What did you first think when you saw these images?

For some they look like they could be an oil painting, but the reality is far from that. The first photograph shows flames engulfing chairs and a dining table inside a burning home in Mariposa county, California, on Saturday.

A ferocious wildfire in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada raged uncontained over the weekend, forcing thousands of residents from their homes in the gateway to Yosemite national park.

The Oak fire started on Friday near the town of Midpines, California, and has exploded in size. It remained at 0% containment on Sunday night despite a heavily resourced firefighting effort, having consumed more than 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres).

Discussing the brutality and fast-growing nature of the blaze, the former vice-president Al Gore, long a campaigner for action on the climate crisis, warned: “The survival of our civilization is at stake.”

Burning through dense and dry vegetation on the region’s steep and rugged hillsides, the blaze was fanned by gusty winds and temperatures that hovered around 100F (38C). The extreme nature of the fire meant it turned tall trees into matchsticks and sent black smoke billowing over the quaint historic downtown of Mariposa.

The fire is one of dozens burning across the American west as the region braces for peak fire-risk months that still lie ahead. More than 5.5m acres have already burned in the US this year, roughly 70% more than the 10-year average.

"The House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack has played video of Donald Trump saying, ‘I don’t want to say the election is over’ in an outtake for a pre-recorded address the day after the insurrection. 

The video showed Trump recording a speech and arguing with aides, including his daughter Ivanka, over lines he was reading from the teleprompter. 'But this election is now over. Congress has certified the results,' Trump read, before saying: 'I don’t want to say the election’s over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results, without saying the election’s over, OK?'

It was a big night for revelations by the January 6 committee, which described in more detail than has been known in the past what Donald Trump was doing as the Capitol was attacked.

"'A full-time climate criminal'

Kylie Jenner has faced a torrent of criticism for her decision to take her private jet on a flight that lasted less than twenty minutes. But the practice of taking brief journeys on luxury aircraft appears to be common among the rich and famous despite mounting concerns over the climate crisis.

It’s estimated that her 17-minute jaunt would’ve resulted in a ton of carbon dioxide emissions, which, while in itself not a huge amount, is about a quarter of the total annual carbon footprint of the average person globally. The trip would have taken Jenner about 40 minutes in a car, causing just a fraction of the emissions.

“I’m not surprised people are upset, they are right to be mad at this,” said Jack Sweeney, creator of the Celebrity Jets account, which uses data from a company that tracks aircraft transponders.

Emissions from private jets flown in the US have surged since the 1990s and will balloon further as larger and more polluting aircraft come onto the market.

The frequent use of aviation is the domain of the world’s wealthy, with just 1% of the global population responsible for half of the emissions associated with flying.

“These startlingly short flights show the immense impact of the wealthy in overall aviation emissions,” said Scott Hochberg, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute.

“The problem starts at the top with Kylie Jenner and other celebrities with private jets […] But it also includes many others, as the US constitutes the bulk of the wealthy elite that have the luxury of flying.”

So what do you think the future of private jets should be?

The UK has already recorded its hottest day ever, and the Met Office says temperatures are likely to rise further throughout the day. Forecasters say temperatures could reach 41C.

The previous UK record was 38.7C, recorded in Cambridge University Botanic Garden on 25 July 2019.

"As the UK braces today for the hottest temperatures on record, the world faces a wave of extreme heat events that have led to deaths, displacement and chaos since the start of July alone.

From raging fires to glacier collapses, recent scorching weather has caused a range of natural disasters that have wreaked havoc for millions.

Abnormal and extreme events like these are likely to become far more normal, say experts, pointing out that these natural disasters are no natural occurrence – instead, they are a dire consequence of a heating world caused or exacerbated by the climate crisis.

A study published in May showed that the recent south Asian heatwave was made 30 times more likely to happen by human influence on the climate.

“Climate change is a real game changer when it comes to heatwaves: they have increased in frequency, intensity and duration across the world,” said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London.

Human activity is adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere every year and only drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions will prevent more climate chaos.

“We cannot adapt our way out of the climate crisis,” Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy, told the Observer. “If we continue with business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions, there is no adaptation that is possible. You just can’t.”

"“It was absolutely thrilling,” says Lesley Stevenson, senior paintings conservator at the National Galleries of Scotland, about the moment she discovered this previously unknown self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh.

The artist’s already famous painting Head of a Peasant Woman was being X-rayed as part of a cataloguing exercise and in preparation for the Royal Scottish Academy’s summer exhibition of French impressionism.

The X-ray plates were processed in an old-fashioned darkroom, and when Stevenson looked at the images she realised she was staring at the face of Van Gogh himself.

“Lo and behold! We don’t see much of the peasant woman, but what we have is the lead white, the much heavier pigment he used for his face, showing up after the X-ray goes through the cardboard.”

Now the conservators will try to separate the self-portrait from the original painting without damaging either work.

“It’s like stepping into the unknown,” Stevenson said. “The challenge will be removing the adhesive from the oil paint layers, exploiting the difference in solubility of animal-based glue and oil-based paint.”

"""They associated my behaviour as a child with words you would use to describe an adult – they saw me as calculating and disrespectful, not just a young child struggling.""

Mumtaz Musa, a 20-year-old student whose ADHD went undiagnosed at school, has spoken about feeling the pernicious and devastating impact of adultification from her teachers.

The term adultification bias originated in the US in about 2008, but its usage has grown in the UK in recent months.

Safeguarding expert Jahnine Davis says it can mean that children of colour are not seen as “innocent”, as their white peers would be. It is a form of racism that has a disproportionate impact on Black children.

One example that caused widespread outrage and protest is the case of Child Q. Metropolitan police officers performed a strip-search on a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl (Child Q) while at school after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis by her teacher in 2020. She was searched without another adult present and in the knowledge that she was menstruating. Her parents were not contacted.

A month after the story of Child Q broke this year, adultification was blamed for another case. This time, an eight-year-old Black boy was forced to clean his five-year-old sister after she soiled herself at an after-school club in north London. The boy said he was forced to do it in front of other people, despite toilet facilities being located nearby.

"A leaked trove of confidential files has revealed the inside story of how Uber flouted laws, duped police, exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion.

The unprecedented leak to the Guardian of more than 124,000 documents – known as the Uber files – lays bare the ethically questionable practices that fuelled the company’s transformation into one of Silicon Valley’s most famous exports.

The leaked records cover 2013-17 when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick, who tried to force the cab-hailing service into cities around the world, even if that meant breaching laws and taxi regulations.

During the fierce global backlash, the data shows how Uber tried to shore up support by discreetly courting powerful figures such as Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron and George Osborne.

Leaked messages suggest #Uber executives were at the same time under no illusions about the company’s law-breaking, with one joking they had become “pirates” and another conceding: “We’re just fucking illegal.”

The cache of files includes more than 83,000 emails, iMessages and WhatsApp messages, including often frank and unvarnished communications between Kalanick and his top team of executives.

In one exchange, Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry. “I think it’s worth it,” he shot back. “Violence guarantee[s] success.”

In a statement, Kalanick’s spokesperson said he “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion he was involved in such activity would be completely false.

The Guardian led a global investigation into the leaked Uber files, sharing the data with media organisations around the world via the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).

More than 180 journalists at 40 media outlets including Le Monde, Washington Post and the BBC will in the coming days publish a series of investigative reports about the tech giant.

Surrounded by youngsters displaying similar warnings – including one that reads “up to my neck in the climate crisis” – Ibshar stands half-submerged in water caused by catastrophic flash flooding that hit her home.

One victim of the devastation is Rita Akhter, 19, who was eight months pregnant with her first child when she woke up one night to find herself waist-deep in water.

“I was terrified for my unborn child and didn’t think that we would make it,” she said, recalling how in 10 minutes, the water had reached her neck.

"The former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has died, aged 67, after being shot while making a speech in the western city of Nara.

Abe, the country’s longest-serving prime minister until he resigned in 2020, was flown to hospital by helicopter after the attack.

Footage and accounts broadcast by Japanese media showed Abe’s speech interrupted by two loud bangs – possibly from a shotgun – and smoke, with Abe stumbling to the ground after the second shot.

Moments later, members of Abe’s security detail wrestled a man to the ground metres behind the former prime minister. The suspect reportedly did not attempt to flee before being detained at the scene.

TBS Television reported that he had been shot on the left side of his chest and apparently also in the neck. NHK had initially quoted firefighters as saying Abe showed no vital signs.

The conservative politician, who had been in Nara to make a campaign speech ahead of this Sunday’s upper house elections, was known for his “Abenomics” policy to lift the world’s third-biggest economy out of deflation and for supporting a more prominent role for Japan’s military to counter growing threats from North Korea and a more assertive China.

Abe was also instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games and even appeared as the Nintendo video game character Mario during the Olympic handover at Rio 2016.

Japan has close to “zero-tolerance” of gun ownership – an approach that experts say contributes to its extremely low rate of gun crime. There were six reported gun deaths in 2014, according to the National Police Agency, and the number rarely exceeds 10, in a country of 126 million people.

Police said the weapon thought to have been used in the attack was homemade, according to local media reports. You can follow the latest developments – and read more about Abe's life – via the link in bio.

That's what Victoria Atkins MP wrote in her letter of resignation from Boris Jonson's government. She is among a growing list more than 27 Conservative ministers and aides who have so far left their posts in the past 24 hours as confidence in the prime minister disintegrates.

""I cannot square Mr Johnson’s patronage with my personal sense of decency and honour,"" said Andrew Murrison MP, while Saqib Bhatti MP added that his ""conscience will not allow [him] to continue"".

At 6pm on Tuesday, the UK prime minister gave an interview he hoped would stem some of the criticism over his handling of the Chris Pincher allegations, but within two minutes, Sajid Javid had resigned as health secretary. Then Rishi Sunak quit as chancellor. And the list has since been rapidly increasing.

Many of the resignation letters name the prime minister's hiring of Chris Pincher as deputy chief whip as the 'final straw' and accused the prime minister of lying. Pincher is understood to have been accused of groping some individuals at a Conservative event in 2019. Johnson was briefed on this before hiring Pincher, but denied knowing this information. After proof surfaced that he was briefed, Johnson said he simply forgot he had been told and apologised for hiring Pincher.

"Today marks America's Independence Day, but many people are calling for a boycott of the celebration of nationhood after the US supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade ten days ago, which had protected women's reproductive rights for nearly half a century, and reverses a historic victory of the global women's movement.

Now twenty-six states are poised to ban or severely restrict abortion immediately, which will make it illegal for millions of women across most of the south and midwest.

The case of a 10-year-old child rape victim in Ohio who was six weeks pregnant, ineligible for an abortion in her own state, and forced to travel to Indiana for the procedure has spotlighted the shocking impact of the US supreme court ruling on abortion.

The story of the girl came to light three days after the court overturned a nationwide right to terminate pregnancy, and Ohio’s six-week “trigger ban” came into effect.

The case has triggered widespread backlash, and has placed prominent anti-abortion political figures in the position of balancing the rights of women and girls – including abuse victims – while defending abortion restrictions.

"Today marks 50 years since the UK’s first Pride march.

On 1 July 1972, Peter Tatchell and 30 other members of the Gay Liberation Front (@gayliberationfrontuk) made history by organising the protest, which celebrated and fought for LGBTQ+ people in the UK.

It was a crucial turning point for the nation's LGBTQ+ rights movement and has inspired Pride marches every year since … Tatchell has been to every single one of them.

‘To think what began in 1972 was one Pride with 700 marchers has now grown to 150 Pride events involving a million people. What a difference 50 years makes,’ @petertatchell1 said.

"‘You destroyed so many lives.’

The victims of R Kelly spoke with emotion about the impact his crimes had had on them.

At the trial, several women testified in court against the US singer, who was sentenced to  30 years in prison.

They described how Kelly, real name Robert Sylvester Kelly, subjected them to perverse and sadistic sexual abuse when they were underage.

In this video, we hear from two of the victims, Lizzette Martinez and Jovante Cunningham, who say they are ‘grateful’ for their abuser's conviction and sentence.

After passing sentence, judge Ann Donnelly spoke directly to Kelly, saying: “These crimes were calculated and carefully planned, and regularly executed for almost 25 years. You taught them that love is enslavement and violence.”

Kelly’s conviction represents a victory for survivors of sexual violence and attracted attention in light of the #MeToo movement, in which powerful men have been held to account for their exploitation and sexual assault of women and girls.

"‘One of our darkest days.’

Outrage and disappointment swept the US after the supreme court decision overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, upending federal reproductive protections set nearly 50 years ago in the landmark Roe v Wade case.

Pro-choice democrats, activists and celebrities have decried the opinion as a painful blow to rights for millions.

Meanwhile, Joe Biden denounced the opinion as “so extreme”, emphasizing the wide-reaching effect it will have on reproductive health nationwide. “Now with Roe gone, let’s be very clear: the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk,” said Biden.

Biden said his administration will work to protect other means of accessing abortion in restrictive states, including abortion pills by mail, the ability to obtain out-of-state abortions, and other ways. “If any state or local official, high or low, tries to interfere with a woman’s exercise of her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack,” said Biden.

"Protests quickly erupted outside the supreme court after its conservative judges overturned Roe v Wade and ended the constitutional right to an abortion.

Protesters young and old joined together to condemn the decision, amid scenes of anger and sorrow.

“This has been a fight 30 years in the making to overturn women and people’s fundamental rights to make decisions about their body. There is no coming back from this. There is no response other than outrage and action,” said Sara Kugler of Washington DC, who was standing outside the court building.

“This will not succeed. Abortions are still going to happen. God forgive them for they know not what they do,” another Washington area resident, who asked to use her first name, Cathy, said.

“They’re dividing our country even more. They really are. They’re making it more complicated. It could have settled it and stopped with this religious push. And this religious push from presidents like Trump who are not even qualified to lead us – it’s horrible,” she added.

Representative Maxine Waters, a senior Democrat from California, stopped to speak with the Guardian as she walked in front of the supreme court building.

“I don’t care what that vote is today. They can not stop us. They cannot control our lives. We’re going to do everything that we can possibly do – we’re going to continue to organize,” she said.

When asked what the pro-choice side was planning to do in reaction to the court’s decision, she said: “We’re going to turn out a huge vote of women. We’re going to see if we can get something on the ballot real soon. We’re going to do everything we can possibly do.”

"The supreme court just overturned the landmark Roe v Wade case, which granted women in the US the right to terminate a pregnancy. 

A reversal of this magnitude is almost unprecedented, particularly on a case decided nearly 50 years ago.

Historically, the court has overturned cases to grant more rights. The court has done the opposite here, and its decision will restrict a constitutional right generations of Americans have grown up taking for granted.

"Just in: the supreme court has ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion in the United States, upending a precedent set nearly 50 years ago in the landmark Roe v Wade case – a rare reversal of long-settled law that will fracture the foundations of modern reproductive rights in America.

The court’s ruling came in the pivotal case Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, in which the last abortion clinic in Mississippi opposed the state’s efforts to ban abortion after 15 weeks and overturn Roe in the process.

The reversal of the 1973 opinion will again allow individual US states to ban abortion. At least 26 states are expected to do so immediately or as soon as practicable.

The court’s decision in Dobbs is certain to be one of the most consequential in generations. It will have profound, immediate and enduring consequences for the lives of tens of millions of American women and other people who can become pregnant, and unpredictable ripple effects that could play out over decades.

The final ruling from the conservative-dominated court comes after a draft opinion was leaked in early May. In it, right-leaning associate justice Samuel Alito laid out a caustic argument for reversing Roe v Wade.

Experts believe the coming days and weeks will bring chaotic attempts by conservatives to ban the procedure as soon as possible, as a patchwork of some of the most severe abortion restrictions in the world go into effect.

Large swaths of the US south and midwest are expected to ban abortion or impose severe restrictions, forcing patients who want the procedure to potentially travel hundreds of miles or self-manage abortions at home.

At least one economist has estimated such bans could result in an additional 60,000 births a year among women who want an abortion, but are unable to obtain one. Such bans are likely to affect 41% of women of reproductive age in the US, and hit the young, poor, Black and brown women and people who already have children the hardest.

"We all know how difficult it can be hard to overhaul our diets. Old habits die hard, and so do our appetites for certain foods.

This is often why so many people struggle to become fully vegetarian or vegan overnight, even if they want to do more for the environment.

But what if there was another option?

Certain plant-based diets can be the ideal, but even partly shifting your diet away from meat and dairy products can still have a significant impact when it comes to reducing harmful emissions.

It's important to note though that it’s not all about personal responsibility ... Many experts argue that the food industry needs to adapt to the climate crisis, and start offering us more eco-friendly choices that don’t swap sustainability for taste.

“It’s hard for people to change their diets,” says Caroline Bushnell at the Good Food Institute, a non-profit that advocates for plant-based and cultured meat. It’s like offering someone the choice between fries and a side salad, she says. “Most people don’t pick the side salad – it’s not really an equivalent option.”

"""I got in the car and he blindfolded me. I was willing to risk death.""

That’s what Trudy Hale, now 73 years old, remembers about her abortion at the age of 18 in 1967 — a time pre-Roe v Wade.

The landmark US supreme court decision, which has given Americans abortion rights since 22 January 1973, was set to turn 50 next year.

But, as the supreme court approaches summer recess, it looks likely that critical precedent will soon be overturned and never reach its milestone birthday.

With the regulation of abortion returned to individual states, a large swath of the midwest and south – about 20 states housing half of the country’s population – will no longer have access to legal abortion.

This is set to see a return to abortion experiences that have many similarities to pre-Roe v Wade America. Pre-1973, those with the necessary means travelled across state lines to get the procedures they needed. Today, like back then, campaigners fear that poor, Black, Latina, teenage women and undocumented immigrants will be disproportionately affected.

What is different today is that some women will be able to access abortion pills over the internet and self-manage the procedure.

We spoke to five women from across the US about their experiences of abortion in the pre-Roe v Wade era. Some were nervous, others defiant. But all shared their story in the hope that their past could shape America’s future.

""We are writing history right now – a new history for Colombia, for Latin America and for the world,"" @gustavopetrourrego said.

Petro’s election marks a tidal shift for Colombia, a country that has never before had a leftist president, and follows similar victories for the left in Peru, Chile and Honduras.

During his victory speech, Petro issued a call for unity and extended an olive branch to some of his harshest critics, saying all members of the opposition will be welcomed at the presidential palace “to discuss the problems of Colombia”.

“From this government that is beginning there will never be political persecution or legal persecution, there will only be respect and dialogue,” he said, adding that he will listen to not only those who have raised arms but also to “that silent majority of peasants, Indigenous people, women, youth”.

He added: ""This is no longer time for resentment. This government that will begin on 7 August is a government of life, is a government that wants to build Colombia as a world life power. And if we summarise in three words what the government of life means, I would say first, peace, second, social justice, and third, environmental justice"".

"Struggling to sleep in the current temperatures?

Heatwaves around the world – including earlier this year when India and Pakistan reached heights of nearly 50C (122F) — have been made more frequent and hotter because of the human-made climate emergency.

And as temperatures soar, the amount of sleep we get a night is dropping, says researchers — with dangerous consequences.

A recent study, published in May in the journal One Earth in May, revealed that the average global citizen is already losing 44 hours of sleep a year, leading to 11 nights with fewer than seven hours’ sleep, a standard benchmark of sufficient sleep. Researchers believe this could be the tip of the iceberg.

"New data has revealed extraordinary rates of global heating in the Arctic, up to seven times faster than the global average.

The heating is occurring in the North Barents Sea, a region where fast rising temperatures are suspected to trigger increases in extreme weather in North America, Europe and Asia.

Recent years have seen temperatures far above average recorded in the Arctic, with seasoned observers describing the situation as “crazy”, “weird”, and “simply shocking”. Some climate scientists have warned the unprecedented events could signal faster and more abrupt climate breakdown.

Sea ice is good at reflecting sunlight but is melting away. This allows the darker ocean below to absorb more energy. Losing sea ice also means it no longer restricts the ability of warmer sea waters to heat up the Arctic air. The more ice is lost, the more heat accumulates, forming a feedback loop.

It was already known that the climate crisis was driving heating across the Arctic three times faster than the global average, but the new research shows the situation is even more extreme in places.

The figures show annual average temperatures in the area are rising across the year by up to 2.7C a decade, with particularly high rises in the months of autumn of up to 4C a decade. This makes the North Barents Sea and its islands the fastest warming place known on Earth.

The researchers said the heating in this region was an “early warning” of what could happen across the rest of the Arctic.

The world’s scientists said in April that immediate and deep cuts to carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases are needed to tackle the climate emergency.

"""Now we can bring them home and say goodbye with love.""
 
Police in the Brazilian Amazon have found the bodies of two men in the area close to where British journalist Dom Phillips and Indigenous activist Bruno Pereira went missing 10 days ago.
 
The announcement brought a sad end to a long search which has horrified the nation and underlined the growing dangers faced by those who dare to defend Brazil’s environment and Indigenous communities, whose rights have been increasingly under attack under the country’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro.
 
Phillips and Pereira set off into the forest on 2 June for what was supposed to be a short trip. But by Sunday 5 June, they had not returned.
 
It was supposed to be one of Phillips’s last trips to the Amazon, the kicker for a book that would reveal all the lush complexity of the world’s largest rainforest. Instead, it seems to have been a final chapter for Phillips, who was a frequent contributor to the Guardian, and his friend Pereira, a guide and expert on Indigenous people.
 
Phillips, a 57-year-old journalist from Merseyside in the UK, and Pereira, a 41-year-old father of two from Brazil’s north-east, bonded over a shared love of the Amazon.
 
For almost two years they travelled together, with Pereira accompanying Phillips on his reporting trips. Phillips was writing a book about sustainable development in the rainforest and the younger man was an eager companion.
 
Pereira believed in the project and opened doors to the jungle and its people.
 
In a statement, Phillips’s wife, Alessandra Sampaio, said: “Although we are still awaiting definitive confirmations, this tragic outcome puts an end to the anguish of not knowing Dom and Bruno’s whereabouts. Now we can bring them home and say goodbye with love ... Today, we also begin our quest for justice.”

"Sudoku, aromatherapy and a haircut are among the suggestions being offered to vulnerable people in the UK who have been threatened with deportation to Rwanda, to help them ""feel better"", the Guardian has learned.

One man, who is in his 40s and of east African descent, has been detained at an immigration removal centre since arriving in the UK via boat in May. He has been served a notice for removal to Rwanda by the Home Office.

He has been recognised as being a survivor of torture and at risk of self-harm or suicide due to his current and past trauma. He is also suspected to have been a survivor of modern-day slavery and human trafficking.

He was not offered counselling. Instead, he received a handout with suggestions on “how to feel better”.

The letter, from Central and North West London NHS foundation trust and dated 30 May, stated: “You have been referred to the Psychology Wellbeing Service for support for the trauma that you have experienced in the past. Unfortunately, at present we are unable to provide one-to-one psychology sessions due to unforeseen circumstances.”

It explained that a “trauma handout pack” would be provided, offering “information about trauma, techniques and strategies to support yourself” while in immigration detention.

Speaking of his experience and the prospect of being sent to Rwanda, the man said: “I am unable to think clearly because of the prospect of being sent to a country that is comparable or worse from that I undertook a traumatising and long journey to escape.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The health and welfare of those in immigration detention is of the utmost importance to us.

“All immigration removal centres have dedicated health facilities run by doctors and nurses who provide mental health support to NHS England standards while onsite welfare teams work to identify vulnerable individuals and provide support where necessary, including taking every step to prevent self-harm or suicide.”

"Summer festivalgoers are being warned that an “unprecedented shift” in the drug market caused by a combination of Brexit, Covid lockdowns and police operations against supply chains has led to a sharp and potentially harmful increase in fake MDMA.

Criminologists and chemists have found that 45% of substances sold as MDMA (ecstasy) at festivals in England last year did not contain any of the drug. 

By comparison, in 2019 – when the research was carried out at the same festivals – only 7% of the pills tested did not contain MDMA.

In the first peer-reviewed scientific study of the trend, experts say many pills bought by partygoers as MDMA were made up of ingredients such as cathinones, a new psychoactive substance (NPS), and caffeine. 

Some users reported ill-effects such as panic, psychosis and prolonged insomnia.

The main plank of the research is fieldwork carried out by the drug-checking charity @theloop_uk, whose researchers visited three English music festivals in summer 2021 and tested hundreds of pills that buyers had believed were MDMA in a mobile laboratory.

The scientists warn that with the impact of Brexit still being keenly felt on legal and illegal markets, suppliers may continue to flood festivals and other events with fake MDMA, posing risks to users.

Zeneta Everhart, whose son Zaire Goodman was shot and injured last month in the racist attack at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York delivered a powerful speech on gun violence to the House oversight committee.

Everhart asked for more schools to teach Black history so children would understand the violent history of white supremacy, given that the Buffalo shooter voiced support for racist conspiracy theories.

She drew a link between the shooting and the country’s history of slavery and racism: “My ancestors, the first currency of America, were stripped of their heritage and culture, separated from their families bargained for on auction blocks, sold, beaten, lynched. Yet I continuously hear after every mass shooting that this is not who we are as Americans and as a nation. Hear me clearly. This is exactly who we are.”

Lawmakers also heard gut-wrenching testimony from an 11-year-old survivor of the massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.

Miah Cerrillo, a fourth-grader, recounted how she watched as her teacher and friends were shot and acted quickly to save herself. Miah covered herself in a friend’s blood and played dead until she was able to reach her teacher’s phone and call police.

“I was shocked when I found out. I still can’t believe it ... Believe me, I didn’t want any of this.""

An Iranian asylum seeker has spoken to the Guardian after finding out that they were to be among the first in a group of 130 people expected to be flown one way from the UK to Rwanda – and then encouraged to apply for asylum there.

The home secretary, Priti Patel, announced last week that the first deportation flight to the east African country would leave on 14 June, a plan politicians have described as “evil” and “inhumane”.

Those facing removal have had their asylum claims deemed ""inadmissible"" by the Home Office because of how they reached the UK – generally crossing the Channel in a dinghy. However, according to the Refugee Council, anyone has the legal right to apply for asylum in the UK under international law, no matter how they entered it.

Those currently detained for offshoring include Syrian, Sudanese, Afghan, Eritrean, Iranian and Iraqi asylum seekers, some of whose home countries are active conflict zones.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our world-leading partnership with Rwanda is a key part of our strategy to overhaul the broken asylum system and break the evil people-smugglers’ business model.""

It was confirmed today that Patel’s plan is facing its first legal challenge under emergency proceedings launched in the high court.

"Actor and Uvalde native Matthew McConaughey made a passionate plea for US lawmakers to pass gun control legislation during an appearance at the White House on Tuesday.

In a highly personal 22-minute address, the Academy Award–winning actor called for bolstering background checks for gun purchases and raising the minimum age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle from 18 to 21.

McConaughey, a gun owner himself, said: “We are in a window of opportunity right now that we have not been in before. A window where it seems like real change can happen.”

His speech came in the wake of last month’s shooting rampage at an elementary school in his hometown of Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 students and two teachers.

Sharing stories of victims and their families in hopes of swaying lawmakers skeptical of gun-control legislation, McConaughey urged Congress to “reach a higher ground”. You can watch his full speech via the link in bio.

"WARNING: this video contains graphic scenes some viewers may find distressing.

""Vile and satanic.""

This is how the governor of Nigeria's Ondo state, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, described Sunday's brutal attack on churchgoers.

Gunmen launched an assault on a Catholic church in Ondo state, south-west Nigeria, during mass, killing at least 50 people.

The attackers targeted the St Francis Xavier Catholic church in the town of Owo as worshippers gathered, according to local officials.

Parishioners were gunned down and an explosive device was detonated, local media reported. Ogunmolasuyi Oluwole, a state legislator, said children were among the dead. Videos appearing to be from the scene of the attack showed church worshippers lying in pools of blood while people around them cried.

Rev Augustine Ikwu, a secretary of the Catholic church in Ondo, said in a statement that the attack had “left the community devastated”.

Nigeria’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, whose government has been widely condemned for overseeing a sharp rise in insecurity across the country, also condemned the attack, calling it ""heinous"".

“No matter what, this country shall never give in to evil and wicked people and darkness will never overcome light,” he said.

The identity and motive of the attackers was not immediately clear.

Seven days of mourning has been declared in Ondo state for the victims. All flags will be flown at half-mast.

"“A lifetime of selfless service""

The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge paid tribute to the Queen – and environmental activists across the world – in speeches at a concert at Buckingham Palace.

Speaking on the third day of a four-day celebration to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee at the BBC’s Platinum Party at the Palace, Prince Charles began his address “Your Majesty, Mummy”.

Thanking the Queen for a “lifetime of selfless service”, he told her during the televised concert: “You continue to make history.""

Referencing her absence from the celebrations, after she was said to have experienced “some discomfort” during trooping the colour on Thursday, he said: “We might have been celebrating that Derby winner this evening … next year perhaps?”

“But,” he added addressing the audience, “I know what really gets my mother up in the morning is all of you – watching at home. Represented here tonight in this great audience.”

The late Prince Philip, the Queen’s “strength and stay”, he said was “much missed this evening but I am sure he is here in spirit … My Papa would have enjoyed the show and joined us wholeheartedly in celebrating all you continue to do for your country and your people.”

“You have met us and talked with us. You laugh and cry with us and, most importantly, you have been there for us, for these 70 years. You pledged to serve your whole life – you continue to deliver. That is why we are here.”

He spoke to a background of projections, understood to have been selected by Charles himself, of the Queen from historic moments – including Nelson Mandela’s state visit in 1996 and shaking hands with Martin McGuinness, the former deputy first minister of Northern Ireland in 2012.

Earlier in the night, Prince William called for urgent action to save the planet. Watch the highlights from his speech via the link in bio.

"What foods do you need to stay healthy at every stage of your life? And are you eating enough of them? 🍎🍐🍋🥦🥬🧅🧀🥛

""Nutrition is one of the hardest sciences to do well,” says Graham Lawton, a science writer whose first book, This Book Could Save Your Life, aimed to debunk a number of contemporary health fads.

And while it is difficult to generalise, Lawton says there is some consensus over the sorts of food we might want to prioritise at various life stages.

We spoke to him – along with nutrition experts, Dr Rachel Ward, who is a GP in Oxfordshire, and Sophie Medlin, London chair of the British Dietetic Association – to find out the ideal ingredients for healthy eating throughout our lives.

Swipe to find out what they said.

As for all ages, this is what they recommended:

❌ Unsurprisingly, avoid ultra-processed foods, which are high in sugar, salt and artificial trans fats (a type of fat so closely linked to heart disease that they’ve been banned in Denmark, Switzerland, Austria and some US states)
✔️ Load up on fruit and vegetables — and remember to eat a variety.
✔️ Omega-3 (found in foods like white fleshed and oily fish) can keep your heart healthy.
✔️ Calcium is not only good for growing children but for adults 30+ to ensure bone health.

For everything else?
“It’s about moderate doses,” says Lawton.

"At about midnight on 1 March 2022, a Russian air force jet dropped a series of 250kg Soviet-era explosives over Borodyanka, north of Kyiv.

They were powerful FAB-250 bombs, designed to hit military targets such as enemy fortifications and bunkers. There were no such structures, however, in this quiet town of 13,000 people.

The bombs fell on at least five residential buildings, splitting them in two. Dozens of bodies were found under the rubble when the Russians withdrew from the Kyiv region in early April, leaving in their path a gigantic crime scene. Ukrainian prosecutors are now investigating alleged war crimes by Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, who began his war 100 days ago today.

A war crime is a violation of the laws of war, a component of international law established by the Hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 and further defined by the Geneva conventions of 1949, including the intentional killing of prisoners of war and civilians, torture and the use of illegal weapons.

"Known as 'that sand girl' on TikTok, 24-year-old Franziska Trautmann is trying to help restore eroding coastlines in America ... with glass sand.

The idea started as many good ones do – while drinking a bottle of wine with her co-founder Max Steitz in college. The pair realised the bottle would end up in a landfill so decided to take action and launch Glass Half Full; the only glass recycling facility in Louisiana.

The state loses about an American football field's worth of land every 100 minutes due to: rising sea levels, heavy storms which wash the land away, and salt water intrusion where sea water infiltrates fresh water wetlands and kills the native plant life.

And this is a truly global issue. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that If the world continued to emit carbon at the rate it was in 2020, sea levels will rise by an estimated 80cm by 2100. If this happens 13% of the planet’s ice-free coastline will go under water.

What's more - is that sand is the most exploited resource in the world after water but its use is largely ungoverned, meaning we are consuming it faster than it can be naturally replaced.

So far @glasshalffull.nola has diverted more than 2.2m lbs of glass from landfills, and the team is working with scientists to expand its work to other parts of the world experiencing coastal erosion.

And we know what you're thinking ... no - the sand won't cut you.

"""Our community will always remember the 72 who died needlessly.""

As people up and down the UK prepare for street parties to mark the Queen's jubilee, campaigners held a special event to remember those killed by the fire at the Grenfell Tower in London five years ago.

Their jubilee street party was held at the foot of the building, but there were 72 empty seats – a place setting was laid for each person who died after the fire broke out in the 24-storey tower block in north Kensington.

Emma Louise O'Connor, who escaped from the 20th floor of the tower when it was alight, told the BBC: ""The Jubilee celebrations being so close to the five-year anniversary, it's kind of hard to be able to get involved with celebrating"".

Nabil Choucair, who lost six family members in the fire, said: “I miss my family so much; we enjoyed many good times together, but they were taken from us in the worst of circumstances. I can almost picture them seated at the table today, joining in the celebration, But they are not with us today. The pain is indescribable, but they are always with us in our hearts.”

A government review into building regulations after the fire concluded that indifference and ignorance led to a “race to the bottom” in building safety practices, with cost prioritised over safety.

In 2019, the then chairman of the Grenfell inquiry panel, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, concluded that the “principal reason” the fire spread at such pace was down to combustible cladding with polyethylene cores, which acted as a “source of fuel”.

Justice4Grenfell organiser Yvette Williams said: “Five years on, a toothless public inquiry and millions still trapped in their homes by flammable cladding - and still no justice. There have been no lessons learned and little action taken.

""As people up and down the country enjoy street parties, as they quite rightly should, we want to let the powers that be know that our community will always remember the 72 who died needlessly here that night.""

"“From 1950-1981, every single piece of immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and work in the UK”.

This is the main conclusion of a 52-page historical analysis commissioned, and later suppressed, by the UK Home Office.

The leaked report, by an unnamed historian, which has been seen by the Guardian, describes how “the British Empire depended on racist ideology in order to function”, and sets out how this affected the laws passed in the postwar period.

It finds that the scandal was caused by a failure to recognise that changes to British immigration law over the past 70 years had a more negative impact on black people than on other racial and ethnic groups.

The report was commissioned by the Home Office as part of a commitment to educating civil servants about the causes of the Windrush scandal, which saw thousands of people wrongly classified as illegal immigrants by the department.

Named “The Historical Roots of the Windrush Scandal”, the report focuses on the immigration legislation of the 20th century, rather than on more recent events, such as the effects of the hostile environment policies introduced by Theresa May when she was home secretary.

A Home Office spokesperson said the department would not name the historian who wrote the history, adding that the Home Office was making progress towards “becoming a more compassionate and open organisation.”

"Before his capture, Ukrainian soldier and photographer, Dmytro Kozatsky, documented the siege of the Azovstal metalworks.

The Azov regiment fighter, pictured on the sixth slide, then posted his images on social media, asking that they be shared as widely as possible.

The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steel works surrendered late last Friday, according to Russia’s defence ministry, marking an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in the city of Mariupol.

The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins.

"“You must be the generation that succeeds in addressing the planetary emergency of climate change.""

The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has told new university graduates not to take up careers with the companies that drive the extraction of fossil fuels – “climate wreckers”.

Addressing thousands of graduates at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, US, on Tuesday, he said: “Despite mountains of evidence of looming climate catastrophe, we still see mountains of funding for coal and fossil fuels that are killing our planet ... we must put them on notice: accountability is coming for those who liquidate our future.”

The UN boss added: ""You hold the cards. Your talent is in demand from multinational companies and big financial institutions. You will have plenty of opportunities to choose from. My message to you is simple: don’t work for climate wreckers. Use your talents to drive us towards a renewable future.”

Guterres has become increasingly outspoken on the climate crisis in recent months, telling world leaders in April: “Our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us.” He has also recently attacked companies and governments whose climate actions do not match their words.

The Guardian recently revealed that the 12 largest oil and gas companies were planning to spend $103m a day to 2030 on projects that cannot go ahead if global temperature rise is to be kept well below 2C, as agreed by the world’s governments.

"“This is on you.”

Beto O’Rourke publicly confronted Texas’s Republican governor, Greg Abbott, during a press conference about a mass shooting in which a gunman killed 19 children and two adults on Tuesday after storming into an elementary school in the town of Uvalde.

Speakers at the press conference can be heard instructing the Democratic candidate for governor @betoorourke to “sit down” and telling him that he is “out of line”. At one point, an official calls O’Rourke “an embarrassment”.

When O’Rourke gets closer to the stage, security that was present for the press conference begin directing him away from the table. Though parts of O’Rourke’s comments to the speakers are unintelligible, he is heard saying: “You are doing nothing. You are all doing nothing.”

As governor, the rightwing Abbott has presided over a weakening of gun regulations in Texas, despite repeated mass shootings in the state.

“This is totally predictable when you choose not to do anything,” O’Rourke continued as onlookers shouted that he should be escorted out.

“I can’t believe you sick son of a bitch would come to a deal like this to make a political issue,” said one speaker who appears off-camera as O’Rourke is accompanied out of the conference by security.

Before exiting, O’Rourke turned around to begin addressing Abbott and other speakers again. “This is on you,” he said.

"Americans have to be 21 before they can legally buy alcohol. But in most states, they can buy an AR-15 military-style assault rifle starting at age 18.

At around 11:30am on Tuesday, a teenage gunman carrying two of the weapons entered an elementary school in Texas and gunned to death at least 19 children and two teachers. He reportedly bought them on his 18th birthday.

Parents of schoolchildren from Robb elementary school in Uvalde, a mostly Latino community near the Mexico border, had to wait for hours in a parking lot to receive the news that their children were dead after being swabbed for DNA, according to reports.

David Hogg, a survivor of the Parkland 2018 school shooting in Florida, tweeted: “No parent should drop their kid off at school and then need a DNA test to ID which child is their child because they have been blown to pieces by an AR 15.”

The impact of the shooting has been compounded by its timing, just 10 days after another 18-year-old gunman opened fire on largely Black grocery shoppers in a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, killing 10 people.

It has prompted passionate calls for tougher gun controls led by the US president, Joe Biden, matched by equally stringent demands for more armed guards in schools from the powerful gun lobby and Republicans.

“As a nation, we have to ask, ‘When in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?’” a visibly shaken Biden said. “When in God’s name are we going to do what has to be done? Why are we willing to live with this carnage?” He was “sick and tired of it”, he said, adding: “We have to act.”

But Republican leaders – not least in Texas itself – were just as robust in their calls for more guns in schools as a response to the shooting. Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, said just a few hours after the school attack that the best way to keep kids safe was to have armed law enforcement officers present on campus.

"""It’s pathetic. I’ve had enough.""

Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr refused to talk about basketball before his team’s game on Tuesday night, instead delivering a passionate speech condemning gun violence in the United States.

His team were playing against the Dallas Mavericks in Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference final in Texas, where earlier in the day at least 21 people, including 19 children, had been killed in a school shooting.

""In the last 10 days, we've had elderly Black people killed in a supermarket in Buffalo, we've had Asian churchgoers killed in Southern California, and now we have children murdered at school. When are we going to do something,” Kerr shouted at his pre-game press conference.

“I’m tired. I am so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out there. I am so tired of the, excuse me, I am sorry, I am tired of the moments of silence. Enough!”

Kerr is a long-time advocate of gun control. His father was shot dead in a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984. He has repeatedly backed a bill that would require tighter background checks on people buying firearms. The bill passed the US House of Representatives in 2021 but did not get to the Senate.

The NBA coach looked into the camera before addressing the Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, saying: “I ask you, Mitch McConnell, I ask all of you senators who refuse to do anything about the violence and school shootings and supermarket shootings.

""I ask you: Are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives of our children and our elderly and our churchgoers? Because that’s what it looks like. It’s what we do every week.”

"""The sweetest little boy that I’ve ever known""

That's how eight-year-old Uziyah Garcia's grandfather described his grandson. He was one of at least 19 children and two adults killed by a teenage gunman who stormed into an elementary school in Texas – the latest bout of gun-fueled mass killings in the US and the nation’s worst school shooting since Sandy Hook attack a decade ago.

The massacre took place at Robb elementary school in Uvalde, a heavily Latino community west of San Antonio near the Mexico border. The school serves about 570 children, nearly 90% of them Latino.

Lisa Garza, 54, of Arlington, Texas, has also mourned the death of her cousin, Xavier Javier Lopez. “He was just a loving 10-year-old little boy, just enjoying life, not knowing that this tragedy was going to happen,” she said.

Amerie Jo Garza, aged 10 as well, was identified by family as one of the children killed. Her father, Angel Garza, told ABC News she had just turned 10 on 10 May, adding: “My little love is now flying high with the angels above. Please don’t take a second for granted. Hug your family. Tell them you love them. I love you Amerie Jo. Watch over your baby brother for me.”

One adult has been confirmed as fourth-grade teacher Eva Mireles. “I’m furious that these shootings continue,” her aunt said in a statement. “These children are innocent. Rifles should not be easily available to all.”

The massacre was the 27th school shooting this year in the US, according to Education Week. And it came a little more than a week after 10 people were killed in a supermarket in a predominantly Black area of Buffalo, New York, which is being investigated as a racially motivated hate crime, and a gunman attacked a Taiwanese Presbyterian church in California, killing one and injuring five.

“How many children have to die before politicians stop caring as much about their political careers as they do about their constituents and the lives of the children? These shootings are everywhere,” Nicole Hockley, whose son died in the Sandy Hook attack, wrote in USA Today.

"Did you know the fortunes of the richest 20 billionaires are greater than the entire GDP of sub-Saharan Africa?

And that a total of 573 new billionaires have emerged during the pandemic?

Oxfam has said that the coronavirus crisis has been “the best time in recorded history for the billionaire class”.

As the world’s business and political elite meet for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the development charity has published a new report revealing that the fortunes of food and energy billionaires have grown by $453bn over the past two years owing to soaring energy and commodity prices during the pandemic and Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine.

Oxfam has found that spiralling global food prices had helped create “62 new food billionaires” in just 24 months.

Cargill, which is one of the world’s largest food traders, now counts 12 family members as billionaires, up from eight before the pandemic. The Cargill family, along with three other companies, controls 70% of the global agricultural market.

Meanwhile, Nellie Kumambala, a primary schoolteacher who lives in Lumbadzi, Malawi, with her husband, two children and her mother, says: “Prices have risen so much, even since last month.

"Been tempted to buy clothes from a sponsored ad while scrolling? Gone on a fashion retail website to buy something then ended up buying 10 because of a flash sale? You’re not alone.

""Fashion, especially the cheap kind, is addictive,"" says journalist and ethical fashion advocate @zainab.slow.fashion.

Now brands like Shein – which recently overtook Amazon as the most downloaded shopping app in the US last year – are speeding up the pace of fast fashion with lower-quality, cheaper clothing, this new type of ""ultra-fast"" fashion is making the cycle of buy, wear, throw away and repeat all the more difficult to escape.

""Ultra-fast fashion is fast fashion, but with faster production, faster trend cycles and faster disposal,"" says Mahmood.

And these shopping habits aren’t without consequences.

“This dominant model of fashion is untenable”, says Dilys Williams, director of @sustfash. While acknowledging that the biggest customer base for this industry are people with substantial disposable income rather than those on low income, she calls these clothes “environmentally and socially destructive”.

In response to claims last year that its fashion business is unethical and unsustainable, a spokesperson for Shein said the company ""is one of the only large retailers that orders 100 pieces or less for new products to help eliminate dead stock - which makes up 10% of the carbon emissions across the entire supply chain for the apparel industry. Shein is fully committed to upholding high labor standards across the entire supply chain and to improving the lives of workers in the global supply chain by supporting national and international efforts to end forced labor.”

Mahmood argues that while Gen Z consumers are not to blame for ultra-fast fashion, where possible, they should hold brands accountable for their harmful practices.

"Tymofiy Seidov has not seen another child since 30 April, when most of this basement – in a building near the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine – was evacuated.

The eight-year-old spends much of his time drawing at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light, in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark 40-by-five-metre basement that he shares with 23 adults including his mum, aunt and grandmother.

Tanks feature a lot in his pictures. But today, in the gloom, he is working on some Dalek-like monsters that he says he remembers from a cartoon he watched on YouTube before the war. He also draws happier scenes, sometimes, of houses under the sun and rainbows in the sky.

“I just think about surviving,” says Tymofiy’s mum, Rita pictured on slide six.

The family have been living here below the ruins of a two-storey kindergarten and medical centre in Kutuzivk since the war in Ukraine began on 24 February.

Before the war, the village had a population of 1,500. After Russian troops invaded the village, the population dropped to 50. Even when Ukrainian soldiers took Kutuzivk back, some in the village had nowhere to go but underground – including Tymofiy and his family.

On the first slide of this gallery, Tymofiy and his aunt Yana Sotnikova mark off the days on a calendar to remember how long they have been down in the basement. The exhausted and tearful people living there know the Russians can just as quickly return to Kutuzivka – or at least the artillery can.

Alla Lisnenko, pictured on slide seven, cooks for everyone. With a torch attached to her head with elastic, she is chopping aubergine for tonight’s dinner.

And the image on the fifth slide is of Natalya Leus, a nurse who used to live in the medical centre above the bunker, who has been looking after all the residents.

"The world of sport has united to offer praise and support to Jake Daniels, after the 17-year-old ended decades of silence within men’s football to become the first player in the UK to come out as gay since Justin Fashanu in 1990.

Daniels said he has been aware of his sexuality since he was six years old, but kept it secret as he pursued his dream of a career in football.

But the teenager, who made his senior debut for @blackpoolfc only this month, says he is now ready to act as a role model for others in the game after deciding “the time is right to be myself, be free and be confident” in his identity.

“For a long time I’ve thought I would have to hide my truth because I wanted to be, and now I am, a professional footballer,” @officialjakedaniels said. 

“However, I knew that would lead to a long time of lying and not being able to be myself or lead the life that I want to. Since I’ve come out to my family, my club and my teammates, that period of overthinking everything and the stress it created has gone.""

Daniels’s revelation is a striking landmark that comes when men’s football is more engaged with social issues than in any recent time, but still unable to cite progress in LGBTQ+ representation within the game.

Last year Adelaide United’s @joshua.cavallo became the only male top-flight professional footballer in the world to come out as gay, but others are yet to follow. 

In English football specifically, the shadow of the talented and unfulfilled Fashanu still lingers over the game. The England international came out at the end of his career and was to take his own life eight years later, in 1998.

Amal Fashanu, Justin’s niece, who runs a charitable foundation in his name, said that Daniels’s decision would “come as a huge comfort to the many footballers at all levels of the game still secretly living as gay and who still feel unable to come out”.

“If my Uncle Justin were alive I know he would have been one of the first people to have contacted Jake to offer his support and best wishes,” she said. “Justin’s wish was to create a society where people could simply be kinder to one another and where bigotry doesn’t exist.”

"This is the ‘invisible’ Ukrainian who – with his dog – walked 225km to safety from the hellscape of besieged Mariupol.

When Russian soldiers started going from house to house shooting people, Igor Pedin escaped by foot with a small trolley of supplies and his nine-year-old mongrel terrier, Zhu Zhu.

The aim was to be the invisible man, says Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia – a mere 225km walk away.

For Pedin, walking the equivalent distance from London to Sheffield through the biggest war in Europe since 1945 meant sidestepping mines, avoiding nervous trigger-happy Russian soldiers racing towards Mariupol, and passing by smouldering homes and weeping civilians with heartbreaking stories of death and suffering.

The world is burning … but countries continue to invest in major fossil fuel projects, a Guardian investigation has found. 

Rather than reducing emissions, companies around the world have committed to oil and gas projects which will produce devastating amounts of CO2 and stay within the goal of 1.5C.

These projects are known as “carbon bombs”.

As a result, temperatures will rise which increases the risk of extreme heatwaves, droughts and floods that are already affecting people worldwide. 

But there is still time to turn this around, says Damian Carrington, the Guardian’s environment editor, who worked on the investigation. “It’s not quite too late, but we have a very, very very small window of time to act.”

"""The bills of death"".

Those are the words written on a poster Krig Si Kaingang, from the Kaingang people in the state of Paraná, carried as she protested against a series of environmental bills in Brazil, which have been condemned by activists as a ""historic assault"" on the planet.

More than 200 different Indigenous ethnic groups gathered in the country’s capital of Brasília between 4-14 April to demonstrate against what they say is the ""anti-Indigenous"" and ""anti-environment"" agenda of Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro.

Activists fear these bills, which include green-lighting mining and other commercial activities on Indigenous lands, will exacerbate the already increasing destruction of the Amazon rainforest and hinder many Indigenous peoples from claiming their right to traditional lands.

The protests were part of the annual Free Land Camp, also known as Acampamento Terra Livre (ATL), which unites Brazil’s Indigenous groups in the ongoing fight to save their culture, territories and biodiversity.

Since Bolsonaro took office in 2019, vast stretches of the rainforest have been destroyed and traditional communities threatened.

At least 18 people were murdered in land conflicts in 2020.

Aged 39, Debi was surprised when she started experiencing menopausal symptoms: hot flushes, night sweats, brain fog – and worst of all, depression.

“I had to downgrade my entire life as I had no money, no motivation and no interest in being any different,” she says.

After six years of suffering, Debi was prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a medication used to alleviate symptoms caused by the menopause. Debi says that starting HRT was “life-saving” because it stopped all of her physical symptoms and is improving her mental health.

Menopause medication is growing in popularity with the number of prescriptions doubling in England over the past five years. In 2022, about 1 million women in the UK are using HRT to treat symptoms.

But now, Britain is experiencing an acute shortage of HRT with shortfalls being blamed on manufacturing and supply issues.

The Guardian revealed last month that shortages have been so severe that some women have been forced to travel hundreds of miles in search of HRT products. Debi, who experienced an HRT shortage in 2020, says she doesn’t blame women for swapping their prescriptions.

"What was your guess?

The oil giant Shell has reported a record quarterly profit of $9.1bn (£7.3bn) for the first three months of 2022.

That's almost three times the $3.2bn it made in the same quarter a year earlier, and 43% higher than in the last quarter of 2021 - and even more than analysts had forecast.

Now, the British government is facing growing pressure to implement a windfall tax on companies benefiting from soaring oil and gas prices – which could in turn be used on initiatives to reduce the burden of rising energy bills and the cost of living crisis.

In the UK, living standards are set to fall at their fastest rate since records began in the mid-1950s, with real household incomes falling by 2.2% this year, and energy and food prices increasing.

“I literally have to choose between food and heat and hot water. I’ve not felt so desperate in my lifetime,"" says Charlotte Littlefield, 47, a mother-of-four who relies on food banks.

So what is a windfall tax?

Governments typically use these one-off levies as a tax on companies receiving outsized profits as a result of factors beyond their control, like high energy prices.

Companies that get oil and gas from the Earth are now getting much more money than they were last year because the demand has increased, partly as society emerges from the pandemic, but also due to supply concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"An abomination, disgraceful and shocking.

That's how campaigners have described the truly seismic news that has broken in the US overnight: the leak of a draft majority opinion which appears to show that the supreme court has privately voted to overturn half a century of protection for abortion rights.

The leak, to the Politico website, was immediately the subject of intense textual and legal analysis by US journalists and experts trying to corroborate its authenticity. It would be the worst security breach in the court’s history.

But while caution is obviously the right approach on such a momentous issue, there was every sign – from the document’s formatting and footnotes to the distinctive tone of conservative author Justice Samuel Alito – that it is legitimate. There was no comment from the supreme court itself.

The court could still vote the other way. But if the end of Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion, does happen, it would be news of generational significance for American women and a huge blow for supporters of reproductive rights around the world.

"""We didn’t want to tell another story of poverty,"" says the founder of @chessinslums  @tundeonakoya_. ""We wanted to tell a new story of the children that live [in Makoko], not because of their background, but because of the potential that they wield.""

What do you think of when you think of chess?

For Nigerian chess master Tunde Onakoya the game is a ""great equaliser"". He has set up a charity called Chess in Slums Africa to empower young people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in Lagos - and to change perceptions.

Addressing the @youthhubafrica DARE conference in Abuja last September, Onakoya explained he had started teaching chess to kids in the Makoko slum in Lagos, along with providing arithmetic lessons and scholarship opportunities, to give them ""the required education and skills that they need to create the future that they desire for themselves"".

Widespread poverty has meant education is often not a priority for children in Makoko - an issue that has only been made worse by economic hardship caused by Covid, rising food prices and a lack of government support.

But the programme, which started last February, has taught over 200 children and transformed the lives of many students. In March, chess master and president of the @mitpics chess club Tyrone Davis III visited the project and offered to sponsor 13-year-old chess prodigy Benjamin’s education until university.

Chess in Slums Africa has now worked across Lagos, including teaching chess to homeless children living in the notoriously crime-ridden Oshodi underpass, and aims to train over 1 million children in the space of five years.

The constitutional court in Italy has ruled that children in the country should be given the surnames of both parents.

The ruling overturns the tradition of automatically naming all newborns after their fathers, a practice the court said was “discriminatory and harmful to the identity” of the child.

Children should be given both parents’ surnames in the order they decide, unless they agree their children should take just one of them, the court added in a statement.

Any new legislation needs to be approved by parliament to implement the decision, but the family minister, Elena Bonetti, said on Facebook that the government would fully support parliament in this process, adding that parents should take equal responsibility for the upbringing of a child.

Pope Francis and Italy’s political leaders have expressed concerns about the impact of a declining birth rate on the country, with the cost of raising children seen as one of the factors.

"“Because he’s black they just assumed ‘let’s pick him and put him in a deportation centre’.”

A mother has described how her 17-year-old black British son was found at an immigration detention centre after going missing while being treated for psychosis.

The boy – who is non-verbal – disappeared from a hospital in Kent where he had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, on 7 April.

Two days later, he was arrested by British Transport Police (BTP) at London Euston station on suspicion of fare evasion, before being detained by Immigration Enforcement, despite being a British citizen who has never left the UK.

When the boy was returned to hospital, his clothes contained Home Office documents that incorrectly stated his name and date of birth, and recorded his nationality as Nigerian. On one document, seen by the Guardian, it states his removal from the UK was “imminent” as he'd failed to give “satisfactory or reliable answers”.

According to the BTP, “officers were unable to engage with the male or verify the details provided despite their efforts"". They added that the male provided a false name and date of birth, stating he was 20.

This week, a BTP commander told the boy's mother that when they searched the Kent address the boy had provided, they discovered a Nigerian family living there. She was told that officers gathered the boy was from a Nigerian background as he had the same accent as the residents. She contested this statement, describing her son’s accent, when he does rarely speak, as Mancunian and London.

This incident has sparked fierce criticism on social media with @ayocaesar, a contributing editor at Novara Media, tweeting that the ""details of this story are absolutely harrowing"".

A Home Office spokesperson said: “We rely on information provided by our policing partners when an individual is referred to Immigration Enforcement. In this case, the individual declared himself to BTP to be an adult male. Police nurses assessed him and raised no physical or mental health issues.” They added once his true identity had been established, he was returned into the care of mental health services.

BTP said they were reviewing the incident internally.",2022-04-29 14:36:57

“I just put my head on the table and said, ‘I'm trans’.”

This was how, aged 45, Anya* came out to her wife when she says she was at ""breaking point"".

For most of her life, Anya kept her gender identity a secret, which she believes is the result of attending conversion therapy - a practice that attempts to suppress or change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.

Every weekend from the age of 14 to 17, she was forced to go to conversion therapy under the supervision of her mother and the local priest – who hoped to make her “more boy-like” – instead, she says it destroyed her confidence.

""I wasn’t brave enough to be myself. Instead, I played a part, I played a lie.”

Only in 2020, when her wife sat her down over concerns over her mental health, did she open up.

Both sexuality and gender conversion therapy are legal and happening right now in the UK - and in many other countries around the world.

In 2018, the UK government promised to ban all forms of LGBT+ conversion therapy. But earlier this month, Boris Johnson announced the ban will only apply to sexuality conversion therapy and not gender.

This U-turn has prompted a backlash from some experts who warn of the damage that these practices have on the trans community.

Anya says: “We should have exactly the same rights as everybody else. And if it's abhorrent, for a gay man, and it's abhorrent for a lesbian woman, and it's abhorrent for a bisexual person, then it's abhorrent for a trans person.

“People need to understand that conversion therapy doesn’t work ...

Isabel* was 19 when she says she was the victim of DJ Tim Westwood’s alleged predatory behaviour in 2010. He was 53 at the time.

She is one of multiple women who have accused the renowned ex-Radio 1 DJ of sexual misconduct and misusing his position in the music industry to take advantage of them.

Three women have accused Westwood of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour, while four others allege they were groped by him at events. The earliest alleged incident took place in 1992; the most recent in 2017. Westwood has strenuously denied all the allegations.

The women, who are all black and in their late teens or early 20s when they say the incidents happened, decided to tell their stories in the aftermath of anonymous allegations of inappropriate behaviour about Westwood circulating on social media in June 2020.

In a statement at the time, the DJ denied any wrongdoing, saying the claims online were fabricated, false and without foundation.

Speaking to the Guardian and BBC for a new joint investigation, Isabel said she wanted to pursue a career in music and that: “At that moment, he was the main gatekeeper for access to what I needed to do.”

"“Boris Johnson’s cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin. They know exactly what they are doing. The lies they are telling.”

Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has hit out at the “sexism and misogyny” in politics after a newspaper reported that she crosses and uncrosses her legs during prime minister’s questions to distract Boris Johnson.

The Mail on Sunday reported that unnamed senior Tories had “mischievously” suggested that the Labour deputy leader deploys what it called “a fully clothed parliamentary equivalent of Sharon Stone’s infamous scene in the 1992 film Basic Instinct"".

In the movie, Stone - who plays a violent psychopathic killer - briefly flashes a police detective during an interrogation.

Cabinet ministers including Johnson himself, and scores of MPs condemned the Mail on Sunday report, which the chair of the House of Commons women and equalities committee, Caroline Nokes, a Conservative, called a “dirty little story”.

The Mail on Sunday piece quoted a Tory MP saying: “She knows she can’t compete with Boris’s Oxford Union debating training, but she has other skills which he lacks ...""

It also contrasted Rayner’s background, as a former care worker who left school at 16, with that of the Old Etonian prime minister. Rayner is widely regarded as performing strongly when she stands in for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, against the PM.

In a series of furious tweets on Sunday, Rayner hit back against the anonymous briefing, saying: “I stand accused of a ‘ploy’ to ‘distract’ the helpless PM – by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes ... I am conspiring to “put him off his stride.""

""The potted biography is given - my comprehensive education, my experience as a care worker, my family, my class, my background. The implication is clear.

""But it is the PM who is dragging the Conservative Party into the sewer - and the anonymous Tory MPs doing his bidding are complicit ...""

Johnson tweeted on Sunday: “As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today.”",2022-04-25 15:03:48

"How about this for innovation?

In what they claim is a world first, researchers have developed chopsticks that artificially create the taste of salt. 

The team behind the device hopes the utensils will find an especially receptive audience in Japan, where the traditional diet tends to be high in sodium due to the use of ingredients such as miso and soy sauce.

The average Japanese adult consumes about 10 grams of salt a day, double the amount recommended by the World Health Organization.

Homei Miyashita, a professor at Meiji University in Tokyo, whose laboratory helped to develop the device said they plan to refine the prototype and hope to make the chopsticks available to consumers next year.

For many climate campaigners, it’s not a day to celebrate, but to ""rise up"" and call out governments and companies who they say are putting ""profit before people"".

Ugandan activist, Vanessa Nakate says: ""I think we should be protesting against the inaction of leaders and against empty promises.

""Many times on such days we see leaders coming out and speaking about what they're going to do about what they think about the planet. But these promises never match with action. So we need to mind the gap between their words and their actions.""

"Today is Earth Day.

It is a global event devoted to recognising the importance of climate action and protecting the environment that has been held since 1970.

This year's theme is 'Invest in Our Planet'. “This is the moment to change it all – the business climate, the political climate, and how we take action on climate. Now is the time for the unstoppable courage to preserve and protect our health, our families, our livelihoods,"" the Earth Day website says.

The above images show how the same spot in Santiago, Chile changed dramatically in just six years. As a punishing, record-breaking drought enters its 13th year, the country has taken the unprecedented decision to ration water for the capital - a city of nearly six million.

“A city can’t live without water,” Claudio Orrego, the governor of the Santiago metropolitan region, said in a press conference last week.

“This is the first time Santiago [in its 491-year history] has a water rationing plan due to the severity of climate change,” Orrego added. “It’s important for citizens to understand that climate change is here to stay. It’s not just global, it’s local.”

The Aculeo Lake, which was for decades one of the main tourist attractions of Santiago's surroundings, has disappeared due to a drought and overconsumption of water.

The government estimates that the country’s water availability has dropped 10% to 37% over the last 30 years and could drop another 50% in northern and central Chile by 2060.

This comes as climate scientists gave what is in effect their final warning for governments on the climate before it is too late. This year's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states the world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a “now or never” dash to a low-carbon economy and society.

The jury of the World Press Photo of the Year contest says it is “an image that sears itself into your memory, it inspires a kind of sensory reaction.""

Taken by @photobracken in June 2021, it shows red dresses hung on crosses along a roadside in Canada to commemorate the children who died at the Kamloops Indian residential school in British Colombia.

The institution was part of a cross-Canada network of residential schools created to forcibly assimilate Indigenous children by removing them from their homes and communities, and forbidding them from speaking their native languages or performing cultural practices.

Survivor testimony made it clear that sexual, emotional and physical abuse was rife at the schools. Thousands died of disease, neglect and suicide; many were never returned to their families.

At least 150,000 children attended such schools in what a historic 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission described as a “cultural genocide” targeting Canada’s Indigenous people.

"Would you consider putting your pet on a vegan diet? 

According to a new research, they are healthier and safer for dogs than conventional meat-based diets, as long as they are nutritionally complete.

More than 2,500 dogs were followed over a year with their owners completing surveys for the study, which has been labelled as the 'largest' of its kind to date.

According to the peer-reviewed analysis vegan dogs visited the vet less often and required fewer medications.

Almost half the dogs fed conventional meat-based diets required non-routine medication but only a third of the dogs fed vegan diets did so.

Prof Andrew Knight, at the University of Winchester, UK, who led the study said: “It revealed that the healthiest and least hazardous dietary choices for dogs are nutritionally sound vegan diets.""

But Knight did add that further research is needed to confirm the findings.

“The key limitation of our study is that we didn’t have a population of animals locked up in a research facility and fed one specific diet without any alteration ... we studied what real dogs in normal homes ate and their health outcomes. It gives us a good indication as to what the outcomes are for dogs in the real world.”

An increasing number of pet owners are considering changing their animal's diets because of the damaging impact of overconsumption of meat on the environment, as well as rising concerns over how farm animals are treated. About $9bn (£6.9bn) of vegan pet food was sold worldwide in 2020 and the sector is growing fast.

Justine Shotton, the president of the British Veterinary Association, added that: “There is a lot of ongoing research in the field of vegan dog diets and this paper adds to the body of evidence supporting its benefits. However, there is currently a lack of robust data mapping the health consequences of feeding a vegan diet to a large number of dogs over many years.”

“Although we would not recommend it, it is theoretically possible to feed a dog a vegetarian diet, but owners would need to take expert veterinary advice to avoid dietary deficiencies and associated disease.""

"The day Russian troops invaded Ukraine, 18-year-old Oleksandr Ivanov was shot in the forehead and 10 times in the chest while in the passenger seat of his grandmother’s car. 

Oleksandr, known as Sasha, did not have the life of an ordinary teenager. His mother, Sveta, was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy when Sasha was three. He had spent his life taking care of her, helping her dress, wash and go to the toilet.

Sasha had a natural love of learning, according to his family. From when he started to talk, he loved reciting poetry. At the age of seven he asked if he could learn to play the piano. Despite finishing music school with honours, he decided to study medicine so he could become a neurosurgeon to help cure his mother’s disease.

"""From today ... anyone entering the UK illegally - as well as those who have arrived illegally since January 1st - may now be relocated to Rwanda.""

This is Boris Johnson's latest announcement. The British prime minister continued: ""The deal we have done is uncapped and Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead ...""

The UK government has been floating the prospect of offshore processing for asylum seekers for some time, but the assumption had been that people might be flown offshore (ie, to a country abroad) to have their claims for asylum in the UK processed, with those found to qualify eventually being allowed to return.

Under this plan, people would instead only be offered the chance to seek asylum in Rwanda. It will be a 'one-way ticket', as BBC’s home affairs editor Mark Easton said this morning.

Home secretary Priti Patel is currently in Rwanda signing the deal, and has said people resettled in Rwanda will be given support for up to five years, covering training, accommodation and healthcare, ""so they can resettle and thrive."" She claims the plan “fully complies with all international and national law”.

There were reports today that the plan would only apply to adult males. But the Home Office press release implies that any asylum seekers arriving in the UK on small boats could be sent to Rwanda.

The plan has sparked fierce criticism, with many describing it as 'evil' and 'inhumane'.

Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It’s just chilling, absolutely chilling, to think that people who are coming here for a whole host of reasons – vulnerable people – are going to be taken all the way to Africa to be processed.

“This is not the mark of a civilised society. It’s evil. It just turns my stomach to see that our government acting in our name can behave in such a way, and I think a lot of people are going to be quite aghast.”

"Remember partygate?

In an unprecedented development, the British prime minister and his chancellor are both set to be fined for breaking their own emergency laws brought in to protect the UK during the coronavirus pandemic.

Following a police investigation into Downing Street parties during lockdown, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are now believed to be the first people in their positions ever to have broken the law while in office.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has called on Johnson and Sunak to resign saying that they ""have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public"". There are also questions over whether Johnson misled parliament, as when the 'partygate' allegations were coming to light the prime minister told MPs in the Commons that all Covid rules were followed.

Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, has added that ""Boris Johnson must resign ... He broke the law and repeatedly lied to parliament about it. The basic values of integrity and decency - essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy - demand that he go. And he should take his out of touch chancellor with him.”

The fines relate to parties held in Downing Street during lockdown and are likely to include a gathering in the cabinet room for Johnson’s birthday in June 2020, which was also attended by Sunak.

However, No 10 gave no details on how many events the prime minister will be fined for attending and would not say whether he would contest the fine – likely to be £20 or £50 – or pay them straight away.

A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister and chancellor of the Exchequer have today received notification that the Metropolitan police intend to issue them with fixed penalty notices. We have no further details, but we will update you again when we do.”

"The votes are in: Ketanji Brown Jackson is the first Black woman to be appointed to the US supreme court in its 233-year history.

Jackson, who currently serves on the US court of appeals for the DC Circuit, will replace Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career, said he intends to retire from the court this summer.

At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court, dominated by a 6-3 conservative majority.

Her confirmation to the lifetime post represents the fulfillment of a promise Biden made to his supporters during his 2020 campaign for president, when he vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the supreme court, if elected president and a vacancy arose.

During her public hearings, Jackson vowed to be an independent justice who would seek to ensure that the words inscribed on the marbled supreme court building – Equal Justice Under the Law – were a “reality and not just an ideal”. 

With her parents and daughters present, Jackson recounted for the Senate judiciary committee her family’s generational journey, as the daughter of public school teachers raised in the segregated south who would rise to become a justice on a court that once denied Black Americans citizenship.",2022-04-07 21:01:17
"'You could make horror films here'

When the Russian invasion reached Mariupol in Ukraine at the end of February, Alena Zagreba, 15, went from recording vlogs with her friends to chronicling the destruction of her home city.

While most people hid in bunkers and cellars, Alena and her parents stayed above ground, and her videos are a rare insight into the intense attacks by Russian forces.

Alena melted snow for water while her parents cooked on makeshift fire pits outside. The family survived by moving from house to house as shelling made their home and other shelters uninhabitable.

"""We're not extremists, we're extremely tired,"" read a protest sign held up by Surav Harris, a young Sri Lankan protester in Colombo last week.

The Sri Lankan military have warned of tough action against protesters after hundreds took to the street, calling for government accountability and for the president to resign, as the country endures its worst economic crisis in decades.

Some demonstrators clashed with police and military on Thursday outside president Gotabaya Rajapaksa's residence in a suburb of the capital, Colombo. He then declared a nationwide public emergency and ordered a social media blackout. This was rescinded later in the day after the country’s Human Rights Commission ruled that the defence ministry had no power to impose the censorship.

The south Asian nation is facing a severe shortages of food, fuel and other essentials – along with record inflation and crippling power cuts – in its most painful downturn since independence from Britain in 1948.

A critical lack of foreign currency has left Sri Lanka struggling to service its ballooning $51bn foreign debt, with the pandemic torpedoing vital revenue from tourism.

Many economists also say the crisis has been exacerbated by government mismanagement, years of accumulated borrowing and ill-advised tax cuts.

On Monday, Rajapaska’s entire cabinet resigned and his ruling government has lost its parliamentary majority after a mass wave of defections.

And the country's most powerful trade union has now declared a national health emergency over a life-threatening shortage of drugs.

Some have called it a “magnetic turd” and others have said it’s “amazing and a tiny bit terrifying.”

But its co-creator, Prof Li Zhang, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong says it is a ""magnetic slime robot"" that could be used in a medical setting.

And while the team have no immediate plans to do so, they envisage the slime could be useful in the digestive system, for example in reducing the harm from a small swallowed battery.

“The ultimate goal is to deploy it like a robot,” Zhang said.

The slime has “visco-elastic properties”, she said, meaning that “sometimes it behaves like a solid, sometimes it behaves like a liquid”.

The magnetic particles in the slime, however, are toxic themselves. The researchers coated the slime in a layer of silica – the main component in sand – to form a hypothetically protective layer.

“The safety [would] also strongly depend on how long you would keep them inside of your body,” Zhang said.

"Warning: this post contains images some readers may find distressing.

Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Russia’s public image is now one of torture and execution after the retreat of Russian forces in the town of Bucha led to the discovery of the killing of hundreds of civilians.

Calling Russian soldiers “murderers”, “butchers” and “rapists”, Zelenskiy said late on Sunday: “Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women.” He warned that “even worse things” may be found in other occupied regions.

Witnesses of alleged atrocities in Bucha told the Guardian that Russian soldiers had fired on men fleeing the town, and had killed civilians at will.

Taras Schevchenko, 43, said Russian soldiers had refused to allow men to leave through a humanitarian corridor, instead shooting at them as they fled across an open field. Bodies, he said, were scattered on the pavements, with some of those killed having been “squashed by tanks … like animal skin rugs”.

Russia denied responsibility for the killing of civilians. Its defence ministry described the photos and videos from towns such as Bucha as “another staged performance by the Kyiv regime”, echoing a similar claim made after the bombing of a children’s and maternity hospital in Mariupol.

"‘I cannot do a video call with my mum in the jungle, it’s a fake life we live here’.

After the Russian invasion began hundreds of Ukrainians found themselves stranded in Calais as they tried to navigate the UK visa process.

At the same time, on the outskirts of the city thousands of other refugees have been living outside in harsh conditions throughout all of winter.

This video tells their story: the reality of life inside the ‘jungle’, the constant police evictions and the NGOs struggling to deliver food and water.

The UK and French governments have spent millions on trying to prevent border crossings but refugees still attempt to jump on lorries most nights.

Residents also complain of their city becoming increasingly militarised and ask if the Ukraine situation might change things for the other refugees.

She’s an artist and activist from the Ivory Coast who makes sculptures out of her hair. Her pieces are moments, scenes, statements, emotions, rendered in black afro-textured hair – each one displayed on her head.

There are no gimmicks, technological cheats or shortcuts. Ky, 25, doesn’t even create the sculpture on a flat surface or stand and then attach them to her head.

"From the frontline, to bomb shelters and stations filled with refugees, one of Ukraine’s best-known musicians, Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, has embarked on what could be among the most dangerous rock tours in history.

Vakarchuk, lead singer of @okeanelzy_official, was supposed to be playing the rock band’s latest album to packed venues across the world from April.

However, after a visit to a hospital in Zaporizhzhia, a city in south-eastern Ukraine, shortly after the Russian invasion, he decided to dramatically change course.

Travelling across the country, the rock star performed on the frontline, in hospitals, on underground platforms where civilians shelter from the bombs, and a host of recently shelled hotspots, all in total secrecy to avoid being targeted by Russian forces.

@sviatoslav.vakarchuk keeps with him as a talisman a toy car left by his nine-month-old son, Ivan, who was taken to safety three weeks ago.

Vakarchuk - whose popularity is such that two-thirds of Ukrainians wanted him to stand for president in 2019 - says he is doing this 'to make people feel that I am with them', adding, though, that he is worried about his safety.

"""I always think about the young boy who wanted nothing more than to understand he had a place in this world, that he was OK.""

The US politician Rufus Gifford has posted a moving Twitter thread explaining his disappointment after the Florida governor signed the controversial “Don’t say gay” bill into law yesterday.

The policy has drawn intense national scrutiny from critics who argue it risks marginalising LGBTQ+ people.

The bill forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through to third grade.

After that, these topics must be “age-appropriate”. However, the law does not define this term and there are fears it is so vaguely worded that speech could be muzzled in public schools.

Parents will be able to sue school districts over any violations.

Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, and Republicans say the bill is reasonable. They argue that parents, not teachers, should broach subjects of sexual orientation and gender identity with children.

President Joe Biden hit back: “Our LGBTQI+ youth deserve to be affirmed and accepted just as they are.”

Florida is the first US state to pass the bill but others are considering similar laws, including Georgia, Tennessee, Indiana, Oklahoma and Kansas.

These tweets share a personal account by @rufusgifford , the chief of protocol of the US and an openly gay politician. The former US ambassador has explained how life-changing positive LGBTQ+ representation would have been when he was younger.

Both could help our current international oil crisis, according to the global energy watchdog.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has suggested a 10-point plan to help reduce global oil demand.

The IEA’s plan could help cut oil usage by 2.7m barrels per day (bpd) of oil within four months.

Currently, the world uses about 100m bpd of oil, which isn’t sustainable.

Drastically bringing down the world’s oil consumption would help ease sky-high oil prices that are hurting consumers, reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled resources and be better for the planet.

"‘We girls have always fought and we still fight.’

This video follows an Afghan girl who dreams of becoming a doctor. She was studying at school until the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in mid-August 2021.

Since then, girls have been banned from education beyond middle school in most of the country.

Initially, the Taliban said they ‘hoped’ that girls could return to school by the end of March.

But this week, as many pupils were preparing to return to class after a six-month enforced break, the Taliban went back on this decision.

‘Lots of excited girls were already waiting outside the school. They were here hours before their classes started,’ a schoolteacher in Kabul said.

‘Then we told them about the new order. Many of them started arguing. I had nothing to tell them.’

The new Taliban claim to be more moderate and insist that they support every girl’s right to education but 25 years ago, they said the same thing and girls never returned to school under their rule.

For the Afghan girls - like the aspiring doctor in this video - it’s been devastating to see their brothers going to school when they can’t.

‘I feel I’m not allowed to advance any more. I feel I am no longer a member of Afghanistan.’

"""The evils of slavery cannot be forgotten. Nor can the wealth gained from it by a few – including the wealth gained by the institution of the monarchy – be forgotten.""

This was written by Jamaican politician Lisa Hanna in the Guardian as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge continued their Caribbean tour in celebration of the 70th anniversary of the Queen's reign.

Politicians and protesters in Jamaica, Belize and the Bahamas – where William and Catherine have been visiting – are calling on the royals to apologise for their family's historical role in the slave trade. They are also calling for the removal of the Queen as their heads of state, and on Britain to pay reparations.

The Duke of Cambridge gave a speech in Jamaica expressing ""profound sorrow"" for the ""appalling atrocity of slavery"", but stopped short of the apology activists had demanded.

Hanna writes: ""When we in Jamaica say respect, we mean it. We respect you. We respect Prince William and Catherine. We respect the British people. We respect your leaders. When you visit Jamaica, we are polite to you. We are cordial to you. We give you the time of your life on holiday. We laugh with you. We cry with you. All we ask is for reciprocity by taking our advocacy seriously, and that together we can right the historical wrongs and reset the political, economic and social system for future generations.""

Flowers are a thoughtful gift - whether it’s Mother's Day, Valentine's Day or just because.

But behind every bouquet, there’s a significant environmental cost.

In 2018, 360,000 tonnes of CO2 were produced from Valentine's Day flowers in the US.

That's roughly equivalent to driving 78,000 cars for a whole year.

Most florists in the UK and US, import their blooms from other countries, such as Colombia, Ecuador, Sri Lanka, Kenya and the Netherlands.

"Two years ago, Covid took the life of Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab at the age of 13. It also took his family’s chance to lay him to rest.

Two siblings of Ismail, believed at the time to be the first child in the UK to die with the virus, began displaying symptoms shortly before his funeral, meaning his relatives had to self-isolate.

His case was among those to prompt government ministers to rethink the rules around funerals, with the then health secretary Matt Hancock saying the sight of his coffin “being lowered into a grave without a member of his family present was too awful”.

Around the world, over six million people have tragically lost their lives to the virus. In the UK around 164,000 people are reported to have died from contracting Covid-19.

"""It wasn’t her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself.""

After spending six years as a silent figure detained in Iran, we finally heard Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe speak publicly yesterday at a press conference in London.

Nazanin – dressed in the yellow and blue of Ukraine – began by thanking her family, both in the UK and Iran, before going on to say that her freedom would never be total until other detainees – such as Morad Tahbaz, whose eldest daughter, Roxanne, was also at the presser – were also released.

""Then she let rip,"" writes Guardian political sketch writer John Crace. ""A very controlled fury. Icy, almost steely. We had been warned Nazanin wouldn’t be making any overtly political remarks and that any such statements would be left to Richard and Siddiq. Only no one appeared to have told Nazanin. She wasn’t going to settle for anything cosy and heart-warming. It wasn’t her job to make the rest of the country feel better about itself,"" he continues.

At several points during the conference, Zaghari-Ratcliffe differed from her husband when he thanked the British government for bringing her home.

She said she had seen five foreign secretaries over the course of six years, adding: “That is unprecedented given the politics of the UK. I love you Richard, respect whatever you believe, but I was told many, many times: ‘Oh we’re going to get you home.’ That never happened.”

She said this resulted in her finding it difficult to place trust in the words of successive foreign secretaries, adding: “I mean, how many foreign secretaries does it take for someone to come home? Five?”

“We all know … how I came home. It should have happened exactly six years ago. I should not have been in prison for six years.”

After hearing Zaghari-Ratcliffe speak, some people accused her of being 'ungrateful' – a judgement that was met with a great backlash of people pointing out that she does not owe gratitude, but is instead owed an explanation. Swipe to read more.

"Do you think Russian president Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine should be seen as war crimes?

US President Joe Biden and Britain's defence minister, James Heappey, think so. In addition, the prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague, Karim Khan, has launched an investigation into possible war crimes or crimes against humanity in Ukraine.

Khan said that although Ukraine was not a member of the ICC, it has given the court its approval to examine alleged atrocities on its territory. He said that there are grounds to open an investigation based on a previous preliminary investigation on the occupied territories of Crimea and the Donbas published last year, and also on current events in Ukraine.

Khan said: ""we must insist that there is zero tolerance for any crimes of sexual, gender-based violence or crimes against children and that is going to be increasingly important as urban warfare intensifies.""

""No person with a gun, or a missile, or a plane, or a mortar has a licence to target civilians. Civilian objects and civilians must be protected. Prisoners of war must be treated humanely.""

"The head of the World Health Organization has urged the world not to forget the humanitarian crisis in Tigray, saying that even amid the war in Ukraine there is “nowhere on Earth” where people are more at risk than in the isolated region of northern Ethiopia.

As the 16-month conflict between Tigrayan forces and Ethiopian government forces drags on, more than two million people have been displaced - and there are an estimated 454,000 malnourished children in the region.

Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, is from Tigray and has incurred the wrath of the government in the past after accusing it of placing the region under a de facto blockade. Prime minister Abiy Ahmed’s government has denied this claim and accused him of bias and spreading misinformation.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Tedros implicitly addressed those concerns saying: “Yes, I’m from Tigray. And this crisis affects me, my family and my friends very personally ... But as the director general of WHO, I have a duty to protect and promote health wherever it’s under threat. And there is nowhere on earth where the health of millions of people is more under threat.""

Alluding to the Russian invasion of its neighbour, he added: “Just as we continue to call on Russia to make peace in Ukraine, so we continue to call on Ethiopia and Eritrea to end the blockade, the siege ... to save lives.”

The UN has been unable to get emergency food supplies into Tigray since mid-December. Doctors at Tigray’s biggest hospital told the Guardian earlier this month that patients were dying due to a lack of oxygen and medicines.

On Wednesday, Tedros said there was no treatment available for 46,000 people with HIV. “And the programme has been abandoned. People with tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes and cancer are also not being treated, and may have died,” he added.

"Warning: this post includes graphic content and strong language.

A black child was subjected by police to a strip search at her London school that involved exposure of intimate body parts, according to an investigation which found racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the officers’ actions.

“Someone walked into the school, where I was supposed to feel safe, took me away from the people who were supposed to protect me and stripped me naked, while on my period,” the 15-year-old said in a statement, adding that she did not know if she would “ever feel normal again”.

No appropriate adult was present during the girl’s ordeal which took place without parental consent and in the knowledge that she was menstruating.

The child was made to bend over, spread her legs and use her hands to spread her buttocks while coughing, and she is now in therapy and self-harming following the incident in December 2020, according to family members’ statements to the inquiry.

The report emphasised the importance of the question of whether the girl –referred to as ‘Child Q’ – was treated differently because she was black, adding this line of inquiry had been starkly reflected in several events that took place around the same time.

Police were called by teachers who told the review that they believed she was smelling strongly of cannabis and suspected she was carrying drugs, but none were found.

The Metropolitan police have apologised for what a senior officer described as the child’s “truly regrettable” treatment, which has been the subject of a separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation.

The child’s mother said: “Their position in the school is being part of the safeguarding team, but they were not acting as if they were a part of that team. This makes me sick – the fact that my child had to take her sanitary towel off and put the same dirty towel back on because they would not allow her to use the restroom to clean herself.”

"‘A lot of how you perceive the war depends on where you get your news,’ says Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center.

Vladimir Putin’s decision to start a war with Russia’s neighbour has seen many Ukrainian families torn apart, as their adult men are forced to stay behind and fight while other members of the family flee the violence.

But Russia has also been experiencing its own family rifts – between those who back the war and those who oppose it. Often, that divide runs along generational lines, with younger Russians against the war in Ukraine falling out with older relatives reliant on a diet of state propaganda.

Victoria Gogh and Dmitry live in Russia and oppose Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. This has caused tension with members of their families who support the war.

Since the beginning of the war, both Victoria and Dmitry have tried to tell their parents the truth about Putin’s regime and offer them different news to what they consume through Russia’s state news and media.

The Russian state media has been mobilised to portray the war as a “special military operation” aimed at liberating Ukraine and protecting citizens in Donbas from Ukrainian “genocide”. Videos of Russian bombs hitting cities have been described as staged by Ukraine.

In the past, polling has found that television remains the biggest news source for Russians, with more than 60% of the population relying on it for information. Russians over 65 are 51% more likely to watch television than under-25s.

“If you watch television, you are simply more likely to toe the official line. And older people tend to watch more TV,” explains Andrei Kolesnikov.

“We see that a majority of Russians appear to support the country’s actions, at least the way these actions are presented to them by the media,” Kolesnikov said.

He said it was unsurprising, given the sensitivity of the topic, that the war had created tensions between families and friends: “It is very hard for people to accept that their side are actually the bad guys.”

"This image shows an injured pregnant woman being carried by Ukrainian emergency services from a maternity hospital that was damaged by Russian shelling in Mariupol.

Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy decried the bombing which took place yesterday. He said: ""Hospitals and schools are destroyed. Churches and ordinary buildings are destroyed. People are killed. Children are killed. Air bombing on a children’s hospital is the ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening.”

The United Nations Population Fund condemned the strike. Footage of the attack shared online by Zelenskiy shows the hospital’s windows being blown out, and parts of it collapsing.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmitryo Kuleba, accused Russia of “holding 400,000 people hostage” in Mariupol, much of whose population has been without power, heat, water or phone signal for over a week.

Amid western warnings that Moscow’s invasion was about to become even more brutal as the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, seeks to regain stalled momentum, local authorities described the damage to the hospital – a combined 600-bed complex with children’s and maternity wards – as “colossal” and said at least 17 people had been wounded, including women in labour.

The deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, said the city was being shelled continuously and 1,170 residents had died, 47 of whom were buried in a mass grave on Wednesday. “It’s medieval,” he said. “It’s pure genocide. The attack isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime.""

The Guardian was unable to fully verify the Ukrainian officials’ accounts, but video published by the Associated Press showed multiple injured people at the site of the hospital attack.

Zelenskiy said on Wednesday the threat level against the country was “at the maximum” and again called on the west to impose a no-fly zone, saying it risked a “humanitarian catastrophe” if it did not.

He called the Russians “Nazis” in an interview with Sky News, saying: “If you are united against the Nazis and this terror, you have to close. Don’t wait for me ask you several times, a million times. Close the sky.” He warned that otherwise “millions” could die.

"Warning: this gallery contains images some may find disturbing

These heartbreaking images show the ‘apocalyptic’ conditions that people in the heavily bombed port of Mariupol, Ukraine are facing.

Hundreds of thousands of residents have been sheltering for more than a week without water or power, anxiously waiting for news of evacuation efforts.

Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said the country will try to evacuate civilians from six besieged cities, including Mariupol.

Up to now, there have been repeated attempts to establish a humanitarian corridor to ease the suffering, only for ceasefire agreements to collapse and heavy shelling to continue.

As the fighting continues there are fears of worsening death tolls and journalists in Mariupol describe seeing corpses lying in the streets and hungry people breaking into stores in search of food and melting snow for water.

“This situation is really apocalyptic for people, it is getting worse, they are running out of essential supplies,” said Ewan Watson, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Today, Ukraine says Russia has agreed to stop firing in areas of humanitarian corridors from 9am to 9pm local time (7am-7pm GMT).

Previous attempts to establish safe evacuation corridors have largely failed due to attacks by Russian forces, and there were few details on Wednesday's new effort.

"'They forget about the war for just a moment and think about something else.'

Violinist and teacher Vera Lytovchenko (@veralytovchenko), has traded a theatre for a basement in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine and played her violin for fellow residents taking cover from the Russian bombing.

Lytovchenko said she was inspired in seeing one of her students play in a makeshift bomb shelter at the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

‘It is a big pleasure for me to have the ability to do something for my 'cellar family,’ Vera says.

The musician says the violin has become an important part of life in the past week because it helps comfort the people around her.

This video of Lytovchenko playing Ніч яка місячна (The Night is So Moonlit) has gone viral on Twitter, but Lytovchenko said she is mainly interested about her friends’ and colleagues’ reactions on Facebook because that is how she knows they are still alive.

Lytovchenko said she would stay in Kharkiv to rebuild the city. ‘I won’t just play,’ she said. ‘This is my land. I want to help rebuild the city with my own hands.’

"Have you spotted any of this disinformation being spread online?

Untrue claims about genocide and authorities in Kyiv supporting nazism are among the most common falsehoods pushed online amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to analysis by NewsGuard.

This comes as Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube have taken action to block access to the Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik.

“Russia employs a multilayered strategy to introduce, amplify, and spread false and distorted narratives across the world – relying on a mix of official state media sources, anonymous websites and accounts, and other methods to distribute propaganda that advances the Kremlin’s interests and undermines its adversaries,” the analysis said.

"While on air, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D’Agata stated last week that Ukraine “isn’t a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades. This is a relatively civilised, relatively European – I have to choose those words carefully, too – city, one where you wouldn’t expect that, or hope that it’s going to happen”.

Outrage immediately mounted online, and the veteran correspondent quickly apologised, but since Russia began its large-scale invasion on 24 February, many journalists from around the world have echoed similar sentiments - largely followed by apologies.

Writing in the Telegraph, Daniel Hannan explained: “They seem so like us. That is what makes it so shocking. Ukraine is a European country. Its people watch Netflix and have Instagram accounts, vote in free elections and read uncensored newspapers. War is no longer something visited upon impoverished and remote populations.”

The US-based Arab and Middle Eastern Journalists Association was deeply troubled by the coverage, recently issuing a statement on the matter: “Ameja condemns and categorically rejects orientalist and racist implications that any population or country is ‘uncivilised’ or bears economic factors that make it worthy of conflict,” reads the statement.

“This type of commentary reflects the pervasive mentality in western journalism of normalising tragedy in parts of the world such as the Middle East, Africa, south Asia, and Latin America.” Such coverage, the report correctly noted, “dehumanises and renders their experience with war as somehow normal and expected”.

We spoke with Goldsmiths University professor Dr Omega Douglas – who is an expert in race, representation, and international reporting – about what language is being used, what it says about our society, and what steps we can take to prevent this sort of rhetoric in the future.

At the start of a press event at South Florida University in Tampa on Wednesday, the governor said ""you do not have to wear those masks” while pointing his finger at the youngsters.

"“I have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this.

""Today’s IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership,"" said António Guterres, the UN secretary general,
after the world's foremost body of climate researchers: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued their latest warning on global heating.

In what some scientists termed “the bleakest warning yet”, the landmark report from the IPCC said climate breakdown is accelerating rapidly, many of the impacts will be more severe than predicted and there is only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages.

“The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, a co-chair of working group 2 of the IPCC. “Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.”

This is the second part of the IPCC’s latest assessment report, which deals with the impacts of climate breakdown, sets out areas where the world is most vulnerable, and details how we can try to adapt and protect against some of the impacts. It is the sixth since the IPCC was first convened by the UN in 1988, and may be the last to be published while there is still some chance of avoiding the worst.

Initial reports said the 13 border guards had died after refusing to surrender Snake Island – which is known as Zmiinyi Island in Ukrainian – sits 186 miles west of Crimea, from a Russian air and sea bombardment on Thursday.

In his address after the first day of the Russian invasion, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced he would posthumously award all the soldiers the Hero of Ukraine award. “All border guards died heroically but did not give up,” Zelenskiy said.

They had reportedly responded to an officer on board the Russian warship with a defiant: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself” when asked to lay down their weapons.

But in a recent statement posted on Facebook, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine said: “We [have a] strong belief that all Ukrainian defenders of Zmiinyi (Snake) Island may be alive.”

Within minutes of Putin’s short televised address, at about 5am Ukrainian time, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv.

The scope of the Russian attack appears to be massive. Ukraine’s interior ministry reported that the country was under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles, with Russia appearing to target infrastructure near major cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Dnipro.

Explosions from artillery rockets lit up the night sky as shelling began near Mariupol, video showed. A senior adviser to Ukraine’s interior ministry said that it appeared Russian troops may soon move on Kharkiv, which is about 20 miles from the border.

"“Women, girls and people able to bear children are the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies.”

Clad in green - the colour adopted by the pro-choice movement – crowds of people celebrated in Colombia's capital Bogotá yesterday as abortion was decriminalised during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.

The historic move adds to a recent string of legal victories for reproductive rights in Latin America, including a series of rulings in Mexico and Argentina that lowered barriers to abortion.

Abortion in Colombia has previously only been allowed where there was a risk to the life or health of the pregnant mother; the existence of life-threatening foetal malformations; or when the pregnancy was the result of rape, incest or non-consensual artificial insemination.

Reproductive rights groups estimate that as many as 400,000 abortions are performed each year in Colombia, with only 10% carried out legally. During 2020, at least 26,223 unsafe abortions were carried out across the country, according to Profamilia – a local reproductive healthcare provider.

Latin America, a traditionally conservative region with a powerful Catholic and evangelical Christian lobby, has some of the world’s most restrictive abortion laws, often banning the procedure outright.

In El Salvador for example, dozens of women have been jailed for homicide after suffering obstetric emergencies.

Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said: “We celebrate this ruling as a historic victory ... Women, girls and people able to bear children are the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies... Now, instead of punishing them, the Colombian authorities will have to recognise their autonomy over their bodies and their life plans.""

Eugenia Lopez Uribe, the International Planned Parenthood Foundation’s regional director for Americas and the Caribbean region, added: “... the Green Wave is strong and growing, and the fight for reproductive rights and justice will not end until every person can access high-quality sexual and reproductive healthcare when and where they need it.""

"Had you heard the term kleptocrat before? 

A massive leak from one of the world’s biggest private banks, Credit Suisse, has exposed the hidden wealth of clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes.

The findings points to widespread failures of due diligence by the bank, despite repeated pledges over decades to weed out dubious clients and illicit funds. The Guardian is part of a consortium of media outlets given exclusive access to the data.

One of the most notorious cases in Credit Suisse’s history involved the corrupt Philippine dictator and kleptocrat Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda. The couple are estimated to have siphoned as much as $10bn from the Philippines during the three terms Ferdinand was president, which ended in 1986.

The leak revealed that in 2000 Credit Suisse gave an account to an attorney who, eight years earlier, had been convicted of helping the Marcoses launder money.

On Twitter today after the investigation was published, sociologist @ash_presto wrote: ""Marcoses stole an estimated 513,720,000,000PHP. The average annual income is 313,348PHP. Meaning, the Marcoses stole the yearly income of an average Filipino for 1,639,706.35 (MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF MILLION) years of work.""

Banks that enable kleptocrats to launder their money are complicit in a particularly far-reaching crime. The consequences for already impoverished populations can be devastating, as state coffers are siphoned, basic standards are eroded and trust in democracy plummets.

Credit Suisse said that Switzerland’s strict banking secrecy laws prevented it from commenting on claims relating to individual clients and strongly rejected the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices.

The bank also said the allegations were largely historical, in some instances dating back to a time when “laws, practices and expectations of financial institutions were very different from where they are now”.

"""He was the centre of our world""

Tributes have poured in for music entrepreneur Jamal Edwards who has died aged 31.

Edwards was known for founding media platform SBTV, which helped catapult grime and a wave of new artists to a global audience. He was also a director, author, DJ, entrepreneur and designer, and was awarded an MBE in 2014 – when he was 24 – for his work in music.

Edwards said he started SBTV “on a £20 phone” while he was still at school and grew it into a leading online youth broadcaster. 

The careers of some of the world’s most successful musicians, including Ed Sheeran, Dave and Jessie J, were launched through his platform, which began as a YouTube channel, before they were signed by major labels.

Edwards was born in Luton in 1990 and grew up in Acton, west London. He received a BTec diploma from Ealing College and worked at retail chain Topman to financially support himself while developing SBTV.

When he found success, Edwards undertook extensive philanthropic work, including in mental health and the funding of youth centres.

He worked to break down taboos about men’s mental health, speaking of his own anxiety, and in 2021 launched a project aimed at refurbishing and reopening youth centres.

Rapper AJ Tracey tweeted: “RIP Jamal Edwards, west london legend status.”

Dave added: “Thank you for everything … words cannot explain.”

Bafta-winning actor Adam Deacon said: “... Jamal was one of the nicest, most down to earth and humble men I’ve met in this industry. He always gave me time even when no one else would.”

Edwards was the son of singer and Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards. She said in a statement: ""It is with the deepest heartache that I confirm that my beautiful son Jamal Edwards passed away yesterday morning after a sudden illness. 

""Myself, his sister Tanish and the rest of his family and friends are completely devastated. He was the centre of our world.

""... Jamal was an inspiration to myself and so many. Our love for him lives on, his legacy lives on. Long live Jamal Edwards MBE, MBA, PHD.""

"Patrick Jones, 43, has been homeless since he was 12.

Pictured on the cover of this gallery, his portrait is one of the many powerful and thought provoking images featured in photographer Robert Gumpert’s new book, Division Street.

The project is an exploration of the stark divide between San Francisco’s haves and have-nots - and though all the pictures were captured in the Californian city, Gumpert told the SF Public Press, the book is “actually the story of America … I think it’s an honest look at today’s society.” 

A recent examination of 20 US urban areas found the number of deaths among people living without housing shot up by 77% in the five years ending in 2020.

In 2016, when the Super Bowl came to San Francisco, many homeless people were ‘urged’ to move to the ironically named Division Street. It’s reported that city officers hoped this would mean those sleeping rough would remain ‘invisible’ to the visiting crowds.

At the same time, Gumpert started talking with and photographing people he met who were living on the street and in shelters. He says: ‘Without the understanding of the people I have met on the streets, their remarkable generosity of spirit and trust, this project would never have happened.’

"Who will be paying for Prince Andrew's settlement with Virginia Giuffre?

The sum is undisclosed but lawyers say it is certain to run into the millions, with estimates ranging from £5m to £14m.

Such eye-watering figures have prompted calls for the source of the funds to be made public, particularly amid suggestions that the Queen will have to bail out her son.

Andrew is known to be trying to sell his £17m ski chalet in Verbier, Switzerland, but it is understood to be heavily mortgaged and the net proceeds are unlikely to cover the costs.

The surprise out-of-court agreement means Andrew makes no admission of guilt over the claims by Giuffre that she was trafficked to have sex with the Queen’s son on three occasions when she was 17.

For months Prince Andrew has been clear about the accusations of sexual assault he faced from Giuffre: they were baseless and he would fight them all the way in court.

This week he agreed to a settlement that states he had “never intended to malign Ms Giuffre’s character” and that he recognised she had “suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks”. Andrew also pledged to “demonstrate his regret for his association” with the sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The settlement will cost him millions of pounds in legal fees on top of the undisclosed amount he has agreed to hand over, reported to be around £12m.

"""There's nothing pretty about wage theft"".

That was the message protesters displayed last night outside Molly-Mae Hague’s Pretty Little Thing (PLT) fashion show in London.

Demonstrators accused the parent brand boohoo PLC Ltd of being 'built on worker exploitation', and contributing to the fast fashion crisis.

They were demanding that the brands ensure their suppliers pay their garment workers fair living wages and recognise their unions, and that the brands commit to a drastic reduction in output.

Claims in some of the posters about the wages paid to Leicester garment workers supplying boohoo were rejected by the company. boohoo group PLC said: ""Any suggestion that the people making clothes for PLT or any other boohoo group PLC brand are paid lower than the minimum wage is grossly inaccurate.

""We publish a list of all our approved UK and international manufacturers, all of whom have been audited over the last 18 months, and we do not tolerate any non-compliance with our supplier Code of Conduct. We operate a whistleblowing hotline so people can share any concerns they may have and we work with relevant government agencies to ensure the people who make our clothes have their rights in the workplace protected.""

Fair fashion campaigner Venetia La Manna (image one) and Mayisha of @ohsoethical  organised the protests. They said: ""Boohoo have been repeatedly confronted with the reality their garment workers face across their supply chain for years. It has been widely documented, particularly in the June 2020 report by Labour Behind the Label, which exposed the horrific conditions workers were subjected to in the pandemic.

""Boohoo and its friends have made the choice to depend on sweatshop labour and our planet is suffering the consequences of their greed.""

PLT has just announced a resale platform where users can sell and buy second-hand items from any brand, but @venetialamanna says this is 'shameless greenwashing'.

"These birds are being recruited to pick up discarded cigarette butts from the streets and squares of a Swedish city as part of a cost-cutting drive.

The crows carry out the task as they receive some food for every butt that they deposit in a bespoke machine designed by a startup in Södertälje, near Stockholm.

“They are wild birds taking part on a voluntary basis,” said Christian Günther-Hanssen, the founder of Corvid Cleaning, the company behind the method.

The Keep Sweden Tidy Foundation says that more than 1bn cigarette butts are left on Sweden’s streets each year, representing 62% of all litter. Södertälje spends 20m Swedish kronor (£1.6m) on street cleaning.

Günther-Hanssen estimates his method could save at least 75% of costs involved with picking up cigarette butts in the city.

Södertälje is carrying out a pilot project before potentially rolling out the operation across the city, with the health of the birds being the key consideration given the type of waste involved.

"A typical drag king performance often involves a cisgender woman, transgender man or non-binary person in male or masculine drag on stage singing, lip-syncing and dancing - all with the aim to trying to dismantle the patriarchy and empower LGBTQ+ people.

Their performances take on male stereotypes and toxic masculinity while exploring issues around mental health, sexuality and gender identity.

“With the art of being a drag queen, you get feminine energy, which is beautiful and elegant,” explains drag king Chiyo (@prinxchiyo).

“But, drag kings, we work with masculinity, which is toxic and boring and gross. So we have to find a way to make masculinity not only entertaining, but not toxic, and show people what healthy masculinity can look like.”

Drag King Beau Jangles (@beaujanglesdrag) says: “Without doing drag king-ing I wouldn’t have realised that I’m non-binary as quickly ... It was very important to me when I was figuring out my queerness, as a way of tapping into the masculinity that I had been told I wasn’t allowed to.”

Scottish drag king Dorian T Fisk (@doriant.fisk) wants to see drag kings on an equal footing with the queens: “A lot more show bookers are booking kings, so we’re starting to even out a little bit ... but there is a lot of work to be done.""

"Joseph Fofana says he earns about 50,000 leone (£3.30) for a brutal, 14-hour day at sea, crammed in a boat with 20 men - all who pay the owner for use of his vessel.

The 36-year-old is one of the many local fishers in Tombo, one of Sierra Leone's largest fishing ports, who have been left feeling powerless as illegal and unregulated industrial-scale fishing by foreign fleets pillages fish populations.

Every day, about 13,000 small boats like Fofana’s cast off from Sierra Leone’s 314-mile (506km) coastline. Fisheries employ 500,000 of the west African nation’s nearly 8 million people, represent 12% of the economy and are the source of 80% of the population’s protein consumption.

But a dozen fishers interviewed by the Guardian say their catch is dwindling rapidly due to sustained overfishing on a large scale. “Many years ago, you could see fish in the water from here, even big ones,” says Fofana. “Not any more. There’s less fish than ever before.”

A new generation of women skateboarders in Cochabamba, Bolivia created the team ‘ImillaSkate’ in 2018.

The Imillas are known for empowering local women and skating whilst wearing the traditional Bolivian polleras dress.

The dresses are typically associated with the Indigenous women of the highland regions, after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century imposed the outfits onto the native population.

Through subsequent centuries the garment became part of the local identity and now, @imillaskate are reclaiming their roots and wearing the polleras as a piece of resistance.

"Parrot POV ...

A 'kleptomaniac' parrot swiped a family’s GoPro at Fiordland National Park in New Zealand - capturing some magnificent footage as it took flight with its loot.

Aotearoa’s native alpine parrot species, the kea, is known for its curious and mischievous nature – and for swiping wallets, jewellery, packed lunches, windscreen wipers and other valuables from unsuspecting tourists and visitors.

Alexandra Verheul, from Dunedin, had been hiking the Kepler Track with her family when the bird seized its opportunity. The device had been set down on a balcony at their hut, and was quickly nabbed by the kea, described by the National Geographic as “a very curious parrot”.

It immediately took flight, all the while filming its glorious getaway. The GoPro captured the airborne escape, as well as the kea’s landing and brief, slightly frenzied attack on the camera.

Verheul told local TV programme Seven Sharp: “We just followed the sound down there ... they’d obviously heard us coming and abandoned the GoPro … My son decided to go check the rocks where it looked like a good place for a bird to land, and there it was still sitting there, still filming.”

"Are you a fan of any of these books?

From red scare to read scare – these are just some of the books that Republicans are trying to ban in schools across America.

All of the above books appear on a list of 850 titles compiled by the Texan Republican and state lawmaker Matt Krause, who is investigating which schools hold them.

His campaign follows the state’s new anti-Critical Race Theory bill, which bans teaching any materials that could cause students “discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of the individual’s race or sex.”

His list might only be circulating in Texas, but many of the books on his list have already been subject to challenges across the US, or banned in certain school districts.

In Pennsylvania, one school board has banned a long list of books, almost entirely titles by, or about, people of color. This includes Ijeoma Oluo's ""So You Want to Talk about Race"" (slide two) and Ibram X Kendi's ""How to be Antiracist"" (slide three).

Meanwhile, Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me (slide two) has been the subject of numerous challenges across the US, and was reportedly banned by an Ohio school board in 2020.

Groups purporting to be “grassroots” efforts have frequently led the charge, petitioning school boards or elected officials to remove certain books. Though some of these organizations present themselves as a local effort that sprang up around groups of parents united behind a cause, many of the groups involved in banning books are in fact linked, and backed by influential conservative donors.

Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual Freedom, said the number of attempts to ban books had soared through 2021.

“What’s unique is it appears to be an organized effort by a number of advocacy groups to activate members in local chapters to challenge books in school libraries and public libraries in the United States,” she said.

"Could pillow fighting be the next great combat sport? No seriously ...

""There’s just something so cathartic about getting hit in the head with a pillow,” says entrepreneur Steve Williams, who has created the Pillow Fighting Championships (PFC), and even organised a pay-per-view event.

Williams is framing PFC as the next UFC—the largest mixed martial arts (MMA) organization in the world—borrowing heavily from the latter’s franchising business model and lurid, aggressive branding. Going door-to-door selling the martial-arts studios and boxing gyms of south Florida on his concept, he recruited dozens of active MMA fighters, reality TV stars, bare-knuckle boxers, mechanics, single moms, and veterinarians to start training with his pillows – and now it is a professional combat sport.

Described as ""hardcore swinging with specialised pillows"", competitors win by hitting their opponent in the head the most across three 90-second rounds. The pillows – which make a crinkling sound like a dry diaper when held still and crack like a horsewhip when connecting with a cheekbone – are queen-sized, stuffed with foam, and encased in nylon sailcloth.

“You don’t really need to explain [pillow fighting] to people—that’s the beauty,” says Williams. As he sees it, pillow fighting is not just a gimmick: “There’s hardcore aggression with pillow fighting, but nobody gets hurt. A lot of people don’t want to see the blood and violence anymore.”

"Just what the doctor ordered?

Research has found that spending just two hours in nature per week significantly boosts health and wellbeing ... And so in Canada this is being made part of treatment plans for both physical and mental health.

Parks Canada, the agency that manages the country’s 38 national parks and ten national park reserves, is collaborating with Canada's national nature prescription programme PaRx to allow registered healthcare professionals to provide a free annual passes to patients.

The pass would usually cost $72 CAD ($57 USD) per adult for a year of unlimited access to national parks, but this initiative would allow some doctors to prescribe them for free.

“So this is all about breaking down those barriers to access to nature,” PaRx director Dr. Melissa Lem told Global News.

The Black Cop, a short film commissioned by Guardian Documentaries and supported by the BFI Doc Society Fund, has been nominated for a BAFTA Film Award.

This intimate portrait of Gamal 'G' Turawa, an ex-Metropolitan police officer, explores his memories of racially profiling and harassing black people and homophobia in his early career.

Now an openly gay man, Turawa’s story is a multi-layered one and sits in the centre of three pivotal moments in recent British history, from the black communities’ resistance of oppressive policing, to the push for LGBTQIA equality and the aftermath of the west African 'farming' phenomenon, where white families took care of black children outside the remit of local authorities.

""In one person and one story we present a villain, victim and hero and begin to understand the potential that we all have in being any one of these, even all three,"" says director and producer @cherishoteka.

"With more than 1,400 civilians dead, hundreds of thousands displaced and an economy on the brink of collapse, Myanmar is in crisis.

In February 2021 the country's progress towards democracy was stalled when the military seized power.

A few days after the coup, mass protests erupted in Yangon and across Myanmar, and towards the end of the month the junta began deploying increasingly violent tactics, from water cannon, beatings and rubber bullets to live ammunition. It has been accused of targeting civilians, hunting public sector workers and blocking aid as part of an attempt to crush the widespread resistance to military rule.

Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people in Myanmar. 

A study conducted by the UN Development Programme in May and June 2021 predicted that urban poverty would triple by early 2022 compared with 2019 levels.

For a new special series, Reporting Myanmar, the Guardian’s Rights and Freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists in the country, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience.

"A rain-weakened hillside collapsed in Ecuador’s capital, Quito, sweeping over homes and a sports field and killing at least 24 people, city officials have said.

Neighbours joined rescue workers in hunting through the ruins for survivors of the disaster that hit after nearly 24 hours of rainfall.

The storm was pounding outside when Imelda Pacheco said she felt her house move as if an earthquake had struck. Suddenly water and rocks began to pour in through doors and windows and she fled before the building was destroyed.

“I barely had time to grab the hand of my four-year-old son and I ran to the stairs, to the terrace. Suddenly the walls in front and to the side disappeared,” she told the Associated Press.

Quito mayor Santiago Guarderas said the intense rains had saturated the soils, setting off the landslide.

“I’ve lost everything. I don’t have anything. Everything is over,” said 65-year-old Laura Quiñónez, who stood beside an ambulance as her neighbours tried to recover appliances from their destroyed homes.

Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of further landslides.

"Why exactly did these polar bears move into an abandoned weather station? 🐻‍❄️

Last year, photographer Dmitry Kokh captured these extraordinary set of images while on a trip to a Russia's Wrangel Island - a Unesco-recognised nature reserve that’s often called a polar bear maternity ward. It is one of only a few places on the planet where the animals can be found in large numbers.

""The island is very inaccessible, which may be bad for tourists but is great for the animals,"" says Kokh, who added that: “I had dreamed about photographing polar bears for a long time.""

On the way to visit and learn more, Kokh and his group received a warning about bad weather and took shelter in Kolyuchin, which is known for the polar weather station that operated on it in Soviet times. Though the station was closed in 1992, the abandoned village still stands.

“Suddenly we noticed movement in the windows of the houses,” said Kokh. “Someone took out some binoculars and we saw the heads of polar bears. Fog, a place long deserted by people, polar bears – it was the perfect setting.”

“The bears walked around the houses and among barrels left on the island a long time ago. There were about 20 animals insight at the same time, mostly males. The females kept to the side with their cubs, closer to the shores of the island.”

Kokh asked one of Russia’s top polar bear experts, Anatoly Kochnev, what causes the animals’ behaviour – why do they love to sit in the buildings?

“First of all, polar bears are very curious by nature, so they always attempt to get through any unlocked window or door. And secondly, unfortunately, these animals were traditionally hunted, and so they use these houses as a form of protection from humans,” said Kochnev.

“I still sometimes see polar bears in decaying windows before my eyes when falling asleep,” Kokh shared.

""These bears will continue to hunt, swim among ice floes and explore islands even when civilisation ceases to exist. But life will remain eternal only if we humans finally begin to take care of the planet and the living creatures that need our protection.""

"What do you think of these calendars?

Our data team put them together after a new report highlighted the “vast energy inequality” between rich and poor countries.

The analysis by the Center for Global Development found each Briton produces 200 times the climate emissions of the average Congolese person, with people in the US producing 585 times as much.

In the first two days of January, the average UK citizen was already responsible for more carbon emissions than someone from the Democratic Republic of the Congo would produce in an entire year, the research found.

By the end of January, the carbon emitted by someone living in Britain will surpass the annual emissions of citizens of 30 low- and middle-income countries, the analysis also concluded.

Euan Ritchie, a policy analyst at CGD Europe, said his work was prompted by the “climate hypocrisy” of western countries, including the UK and the US, that have pledged to stop aid funding to fossil fuel projects in developing states.

The same countries will be able to continue to develop fossil fuels at home. The US has at least 24 pending fossil fuel projects representing more than 1.6 gigatons of potential greenhouse gas emissions, while the UK is licensing new oil and gas fields in the North Sea.

Vijaya Ramachandran, the director for energy and development at the Breakthrough Institute in Berkeley, California, argues that blanket bans on fossil fuel projects in poor countries are “colonial” and will entrench poverty while doing little to reduce the world’s carbon emissions.

“It’s very easy for rich countries to impose fossil fuel financing bans on poor countries, while at the same time increasing their own consumption of fossil fuels,” she said. “It’s rank hypocrisy and it’s devastating for poor countries as they need a wide range of energy to fuel development.

"From Afghanistan to Ethiopia, about 235 million people worldwide needed assistance in 2021 - a number that is predicted to rise to 274 million people this year. Globally, that equals one in 28 people.

But while some crises received global attention last year, others are less well known and were often neglected by the world's media.

The humanitarian organisation Care International has published its annual report of the 10 countries that had the least attention in online articles in five languages around the world in 2021, despite each having at least 1 million people affected by conflict or climate disasters.

The findings highlighted how the accelerating climate crisis is fuelling many of the world’s emergencies, said Laurie Lee, CEO of @careintuk.

“There is deep injustice at the heart of it. The world’s poorest are bearing the brunt of climate change – poverty, migration, hunger, gender inequality and ever more scarce resources – despite having done the least to cause it,” he said. “Add Covid-19 into the mix and we see decades of progress towards tackling inequality, poverty, conflict and hunger disappearing before our eyes.”

Lee highlighted the impact of the UK’s 2021 foreign aid budget cuts, saying that it “resulted in over £166m less in humanitarian aid reaching the 10 countries mentioned in this report compared to 2019”.

According to Care International, the humanitarian emergency in the African nation of Zambia recorded just 512 online articles from 1 January to 30 September 2021 - while in the same timeframe the media published:
- 362,522 online articles on Oprah's interview with Harry and Meghan.
- 1,636,992 online articles about working from home.
- 3,537, 062 online articles about the Olympic games in Tokyo.

"""Heroes come and go, but legends are forever.""

This is the famous Kobe Bryant quote that has been inscribed on a new statue paying tribute to the basketball icon, his daughter Gianna, and the seven others killed in a helicopter crash two years ago.

Sculptor Dan Medina, who created the memorial, said: ""On this day, the second anniversary of the accident, I decided to bring it up from sunrise to sunset and create a bit of a healing process for fans.""

The 160-pound bronze sculpture, which has been placed at site of the crash in Calabasas, California, for one day has the names of all nine victims engraved on the steel pedestal: Kobe Bryant, Gianna 'Gigi' Bryant, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, Alyssa Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, John Altobelli, Christina Mauser and Ara Zobayan.

A five-time NBA champion in his 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers, Bryant's death at age 41 shocked the world of sports and sent his legions of fans into mourning. Gianna was 13 at the time of the crash, which occurred as they were headed to a youth basketball tournament.

Tributes to Bryant from friends, fans and former teammates have poured in across social media today.

""I know many of you are out there and you miss him and still wish to see his brilliance on the court, and what he was doing as a dad,"" Lakers great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said of Bryant, who was the father of four girls and husband to Vanessa.

""It was wonderful the way he was coaching girls and getting them into the game. I hope all of you out there remember him the way you should and give your prayers to his wife and family.""

"“I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation.” 

That's what musician Neil Young wrote in an open letter demanding that his catalogue be removed from the streaming service because of his objections to false Covid claims made by podcaster Joe Rogan.

In an open letter to his manager and record label that was posted to his website and later taken down, Young said: ""With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, [The Joe Rogan Experience], which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world’s largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy.”

Young added: ""They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.”

Rogan has been described by the New York Times as “one of the most consumed media products on the planet”. In 2020, he signed a $100m deal that gave the streaming giant exclusive rights to his show, which is Spotify’s most popular.

Since the pandemic, Rogan, who has legions of devoted followers, has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims.

A few weeks ago, 270 doctors, scientists, healthcare professionals and professors wrote an open letter to Spotify, expressing concern about medical misinformation on his podcast. Specifically, the letter called out a highly controversial episode of the podcast from last December about vaccines, which has been widely criticised for promoting baseless conspiracy theories.

On Wednesday, a Spotify spokesperson confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter that the platform was taking down Young’s music.

“We have detailed content policies in place and we’ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to Covid since the start of the pandemic. We regret Neil’s decision to remove his music from Spotify, but hope to welcome him back soon,” the spokesperson said.

"""We’re just thrilled to have her back home. She is thriving.""  

After noticing Goldie the porcupine pufferfish was losing weight, her owner rushed to the vet in Kent in the southeast of England.

Medics at Sandhole Veterinary Centre in Snodland confirmed five-year-old pufferfish’s teeth were the problem; they were too long for her to eat and needed to be filed down.

So, Goldie was sedated using a water bowl filled with a mild anaesthetic solution and a veterinary surgeon sawed down one inch from her teeth.

To calm Goldie during the procedure, the water was kept well oxygenated. “This meant she was still breathing nicely throughout, but was able to be held for brief periods out of the water without becoming too stressed,” veterinary surgeon, Daniel Calvo Carrasco, said.

Veterinary nurse Debbie Addison also held Goldie in a damp towel to prevent her from drying out – and provide a layer of protection if Goldie’s “puff up” defensive mode is activated. When they feel threatened or distressed, pufferfish can inflate to double their size to deter predators.
 
Carrasco, who specialises in caring for exotic pets, said: “Porcupine pufferfish teeth are known as beaks and grow continuously throughout their lives ... They’re usually kept short naturally, as they’re worn down on their regular diet of hard-shelled foods, but, while these foods are provided in her home environment, she is not as forthcoming in eating them as her other tank mates ... As a result, her upper beak grew to the point where it was hindering her ability to eat effectively.”

Goldie responded very well to the surgery, “there was no stress at all,” said Carrasco. “Within five minutes, she was able to stay upright in the water and within 10 minutes she was back to happily swimming around.""

Goldie is now well settled back home in her tank in Leybourne, much to the relief of her owner, Mark Byatt, who said: “We’re just thrilled to have Goldie back home. She is thriving back in her tank and none the worse for her visit to the dentist.”

The answer is a big number, but how many zeroes does the factorial of 100 really have at the end of it?

"The photojournalist, Steve Schapiro, who died last weekend aged 87, produced some of the most eye catching images of the 1960s.

Born in New York in 1934, Schapiro discovered photography while at summer camp at the age of nine. He started out as a freelance photographer in 1961 - and his images went on to feature on the covers of popular magazines like Life, Look, Time, Newsweek, Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Sports Illustrated, People and Paris Match.

The activist, documentarian and artist’s work includes documenting the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination and Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign in 1968.

He also produced posters for movies and collaborating with both Barbara Streisand and David Bowie for record covers.

"""I don’t see any future for her."" 

After the collapse of the Afghan capital, university student and NGO worker *Amina says what followed was worse than she could imagine.

She spoke to the Guardian's Aamna Mohdin about her experience of being forced flee. This is her story:

I currently live in Pakistan with my family. Before I left Afghanistan, I was working for an NGO and I also studied business at university. When the Taliban took over, I had no certain future. My education was not clear; my school was closed.

I was happy before the Taliban took over ... I never thought that everything could vanish like that. My sister is in grade 12 and supposed to graduate high school. But after the collapse of Kabul, we had no choice but to leave. 

I don’t see any future for her. When I see her, my tears come. I can’t control them. She does not have any future and as a sister I can’t do anything for her.

We decided to leave [Kabul] a month ago when we saw the situation getting worse; people are dying in the streets and their homes, and there’s no justice. There is no certainty and no security. We didn’t know when or for what reason we would be killed.

We left the country and we came here [to Pakistan], but the struggle is the same. I don’t see any future for myself or for my siblings. But I am at least happy; I saved my life and my family’s. I applied for the UK evacuation scheme because of my work and my [other] sister is an artist and journalist. But still we have not heard anything specific from them ...

I wish I could explain the difficulties we go through. We don’t have a place to live, everything is more expensive and people live on the street, and you don’t know the language. My siblings don’t have any access to school. It is like being imprisoned in a house, in a room.

I wish I could tell the UK government there’s so many other people who are waiting for a better future or so many other people who are displaced. I wish I could show them the pain and the uncertainty. We don’t have any other options. We can’t go back to our country but we can’t continue to live here.

"It doesn't look like your usual protest but this is how the Netherlands staged a national demonstration against lockdown measures which allowed gyms and beauty salons to open but not cultural venues.

Dozens of famous theatres and galleries welcomed hairdressers and beauticians whilst also hosting performances.

“After nearly two years of uncertainty, performers and musicians need perspective,” said Dominik Winterling, the new managing director of the Concertgebouw.

""We simply don't know what's going on … what we really want is to play for an audience because that's what we're there for. We want to inspire people. That's what it's about.”

In a Twitter post, junior culture minister Gunay Uslu voiced understanding for the protest but urged caution.

""The cultural sector is drawing attention to their situation in a creative way. I understand the cry for help and that artists want to show all the beautiful things they have to offer us. But the opening of society must go step by step. Culture is high on the agenda.""

In the Netherlands, new covid infections have been hitting near-daily records above 30,000. The country has recorded more than 3.5 million infections and 21,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Hospital numbers have been steadily declining.

"Lisala Folau's story has become one of the first to emerge from Tonga, five days after a devastating tsunami cut off communications between the island nation and the rest of the world.

Folau, a retired carpenter, said he had been painting his home on Saturday when he was alerted about the tsunami.

He told Tongan radio station Broadcom FM he drifted and swam from his island of Atata via two other uninhabited islands for more than 24 hours to eventually reach the main island of Tongatapu, a total distance of around 13 kilometres.

“My elder brother and a nephew came to my assistance, this time the wave has gone through our lounge, we moved to another part of the house when a bigger wave, this wave I would estimate was about not less than six metres, [arrived].”

“Bear in mind that I am disabled. I can’t walk properly … and when I can, I believe a baby can walk faster than I,” he added.

He said they climbed a tree with his niece while his brother ran to seek help. When there was a lull in the waves, they climbed down but just then a larger wave hit.

“We floated at sea, just calling out to each other. It was dark and we could not see each other. Very soon I could not hear my niece calling anymore but I could hear my son calling.”

Folau said that in that moment, he decided not to answer his son, for fear that he would risk his life to save him.

“The truth is no son can abandon his father. But for me, as a father I kept my silence for if I answered him he would jump in and try to rescue me. But I understand the tough situation and I thought if the worst comes and it is only me.”

Folau said he figured that if he clung to a tree trunk, his family would at least be able to find his body if he died.

The Guardian has not been able to establish what happened to Folau’s son and the niece he was with in Atata. However only three people have been confirmed to have died following the tsunami, none from Atata.

"“No one was grander and more soulful than you were.”

André Leon Talley, the influential fashion journalist and former editor-at-large of US Vogue under Anna Wintour, has died at the age of 73.

A larger-than-life character – and six foot seven inches tall – Talley was a pioneering figure in the fashion world. In a career that spanned six decades, Talley used his position to champion diversity on the runway and behind the scenes in the fashion world.

“For a generation of boys André Leon Talley was a beacon of grace and aspiration,” wrote playwright Jeremy O Harris.

Designer and close friend Diane von Furstenberg was among those to pay tribute on Wednesday. “Goodbye darling André … no one saw the world in a more glamorous way than you did,” she wrote. “No one was grander and more soulful than you were.”

Born in 1948 and raised in North Carolina in the Jim Crow era, Talley was a lifelong advocate of fashion, recalling in his 2020 memoir The Chiffon Trenches how he would visit his local library to read copies of Vogue magazine, which came to embody a world in which “bad things never happened”.

He once told the Guardian: “I want every person I come across – the stranger on the street, the church member in the pew next to me – to feel love.”

"$1.3bn a day.

That's how much Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, and the world's other nine richest billionaires have collectively grown wealthier by since the start of the pandemic while the incomes of 99% of the global population reduced.

That's according to a new report from Oxfam, which suggests that the 10 richest men on the planet have seen their net worth more than double to $1.5tn (£1.01tn) from March 2020 to October 2021.

The study found that a surge in share and property prices has widened the gap between rich and poor, estimating that 3.3 billion people will be living on less than $5.50 per day by 2030.

The charity said World Bank figures showed 163 million more people had been driven below the poverty line while the super-rich were benefiting from the stimulus provided by governments around the world to mitigate the impact of the virus.

They have urged governments to impose a one-off windfall tax of 99% on the value of the increase in the wealth of these top 10 individuals, which Oxfam say could pay for enough jabs to vaccinate the entire world and provide the resources to tackle the climate crisis, provide universal healthcare and social protection, and address gender-based violence in 80 countries.

Even after this 99% levy, the top 10 billionaires would be $8bn better off between them than they were before the pandemic, the charity added.

Musk, according to figures taken from Forbes magazine’s billionaires list, saw his wealth increase 10-fold to $294bn in the first 20 months of the pandemic, catapulting him above Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, to be the world’s richest person.

Danny Sriskandarajah, the Oxfam GB chief executive said: “Even during a global crisis our unfair economic systems manage to deliver eye-watering windfalls for the wealthiest but fail to protect the poorest. It is an avoidable tragedy that every day people die because they lack essentials such as food and healthcare.

“Today’s generation of leaders can start to right these wrongs by implementing progressive taxes on capital and wealth and deploying that revenue to save lives and invest in our future.""

"""Our future hinges on your decision"".

Martin Luther King Jr's 13-year-old granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, has issued a stark warning to Democratic lawmakers who have been accused of stalling new voting rights legislation that aims to protect voters from racial discrimination.

Vice-president Kamala Harris has said that the right to vote in the US was “under assault” and tens of millions of Americans faced potential disenfranchisement unless threatened voting rights legislation was passed.

Activists want politicians to pass two measures aimed at expanding voting rights across the country – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.

This is seen as crucial in the face of a wave of Republican state legislation that is aimed at erecting barriers to voting that is likely to suppress the votes of communities of color.

But two Democrats, senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, have remained opposed to changing filibuster rules, which are necessary to move the bills through.

In a statement last week, King III spoke of his father, who would have turned 93 on Saturday and said that the “stakes could not be higher to protect and expand” his father’s legacy of activism and racial justice.

Speaking on the public holiday MLK day yesterday, this was Yolanda Renee King's message to lawmakers: ""Do not celebrate. Legislate.""

"“I really worry people will become too fearful to attend a protest"".

Hundreds of 'kill the bill' took to the streets in cities across the UK this weekend to rally against the police and crime bill, which is reaching its final stages in parliament.

Sections of the bill have been condemned by human rights activists as a ‘vitriolic attack’ on the right to protest, freedoms to show dissatisfaction or to call for change.

The bill’s anti-protest measures grant police and the home secretary, currently Priti Patel, the power to ban marches and demonstrations that they consider to be ‘seriously disruptive’, including those deemed too noisy.

Other controversial elements of the bill include tougher consequences for those who do attend banned protests, including:
- 10 years in prison for damaging memorials or statues
- 12 months in prison for obstructing roads, railways, airports, oil refineries and printing presses
- 51 weeks in prison for attaching yourself onto another person/object
- Banning individuals from participating in demonstrations or even using the internet to encourage others to do so

"A huge underwater volcano eruption in Tonga sent a huge plume of ash, steam and gas rising from the ocean, as seen in these satellite images.

People were forced to flee their homes as tsunami waves crashed into the main island of Tongatapu, following the eruption of the Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai volcano on Saturday.

The eruption was so loud it could be heard in New Zealand, some 2,383km (1,481 miles) from Tonga and was felt as far away as in Fiji and Vanuatu, where people reported that the ground and buildings were shaking for hours.

The tsunami waves reportedly caused damage to boats as far away as Hawaii and New Zealand and large swells were seen in California and Japan but did not appear to cause any widespread damage. Two people have drowned off a beach in northern Peru, local authorities say, after unusually high waves were recorded in several coastal areas.

On Tonga, home to about 105,000 people, video posted on social media showed large waves washing ashore in coastal areas, swirling around homes and buildings, including a church.

No deaths have been reported so far. Though after the power cut and communications were severed, information has been scarce. Up to 80,000 people there could be affected, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) told the BBC.

New Zealand and Australia are sending surveillance flights to assess the extent of the damage.

"""What I earned in a month with drugs I earned in six months cleaning houses,"" says Paola, pictured on the sixth slide.

She is one of the 22,000 women in Argentina convicted for drug offences.

Across the country, 43% of female prisoners are serving time for drug possession, according to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights.

It is, by far, the leading cause of imprisonment for women. As a comparison, the second leading cause – theft – represents only 9% of convictions.

This represents a pattern developing across Latin America: aggressive drug policies that are filling the region’s prisons with women, many of whom are forced into the drug business because they have no other alternatives to support their families.

These women are the most visible – and the most exposed – face of the region’s drug trade.

Paola says she left her home when she was 13 to escape abuse and violence - and lived on the streets for five years until she became pregnant. Her boyfriend left her when he found out. Without work and food, Paola agreed to deal drugs for a neighbourhood kingpin.

Photographer @magalidruscovich heard her story when she went to visit the Unit 47 prison in Buenos Aires, where Paola is serving a four-year sentence.

"Dementia presents “a major and rapidly growing threat to future health and social care systems” in every community, country and continent.

That's according to experts who have revealed ""shocking"" data from the first study of its kind providing forecasting estimates for adults aged 40 and older across 195 countries worldwide.

The Global Burden of Disease study estimates the number of adults living with dementia globally is on course to nearly triple to 153 million by 2050.

US researchers said the dramatic rise from an estimated 57 million cases in 2019 would be primarily due to population growth and ageing. However, several risk factors for dementia – including obesity, smoking and high blood sugar – would also fuel the increase, they said.

Improvements in global education access are projected to reduce global dementia prevalence by 6.2 million cases by 2050. But this will be countered by anticipated trends in obesity, high blood sugar and smoking, which are expected to result in an extra 6.8 million dementia cases.

Dementia cases will rise in every country, with the largest growth in north Africa and the Middle East (367%) and eastern sub-Saharan Africa (357%), according to experts. The smallest estimated increases are in the high-income Asia Pacific (53%) and western Europe (74%), the study suggests.

Dementia is already one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally, with costs in 2019 estimated at more than $1tn (£750bn). Although dementia mainly affects older people, it is not an inevitable consequence of ageing.

The researchers behind the new study called for more aggressive prevention efforts to reduce dementia risk through lifestyle factors like education, diet and exercise, alongside research to discover effective disease-modifying treatments and new modifiable risk factors to reduce the future burden of disease.

But they also acknowledged their analysis was limited by a lack of high-quality data in several parts of the world and by studies using different methodologies and definitions of dementia.

"Novak Djokovic’s Australian visa has again been cancelled just days before the start of the Australian Open.

The Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, exercised a personal power to cancel Djokovic’s visa, likely to result in the world No 1’s deportation and putting him out of contention for the grand slam tournament barring an against-the-odds court victory.

The decision means that Djokovic could be effectively barred from re-entering Australia for three years unless he can show in future bids that compelling circumstances exist, such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds.

Djokovic will attend an interview with immigration officials on Saturday, after which he can choose to leave Australia or appeal the decision. In a statement Hawke said he cancelled the visa “on health and good order grounds, [and] on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so”.

The decision to cancel the visa likely leaves the Australian Open without one of its biggest stars and Djokovic – who was seeking a record-breaking 21st grand slam triumph – unable to defend the title he has won nine times.

Here's a recap of how Djokovic's visa controversy has unfolded so far.

"""Seeing one in real life is indescribable.""

This is the moment marine biologist, Jacinta Shackleton, spotted a dazzling blanket octopus in the wild off the coast of Lady Elliot Island in the Great Barrier Reef.

The technicolour marine mollusc has only been seen a handful of times in the wild, making it one of the rarest sights in the marine world.

“When I first saw it, I thought it could have been a juvenile fish with long fins, but as it came closer, I realised it was a female blanket octopus and I had this overwhelming sense of joy and excitement,” Shackleton said.

“I kept yelling through my snorkel, ‘it’s a blanket octopus!’ I was so excited I was finding it difficult to hold my breath to dive down and video it.”

Blanket octopuses are extremely rare. The first sighting of a live male was made 21 years ago just north of the Great Barrier Reef.

While females grow up to 2 metres in length, the males have only been seen to grow to about 2.4cm long.

Males also don’t develop the blanket octopus’s iridescent “blanket” that makes the species so alluring. For the females that do develop it, the display can be shed to elude predators.

The extreme difference between the sexes is thought to have developed because of the blanket octopus’s unique habit of carrying blue-bottle stingers for self-defence.

“Seeing one in real life is indescribable, I was so captivated by its movements, it was as if it was dancing through the water with a flowing cape. The vibrant colours are just so incredible, you can’t take your eyes off it.""

“I’ve truly never seen anything like it before and don’t think I ever will again in my life.”

"'Living in a flammable flat is giving my three daughters nightmares.' 

Lucy Brown lives with her husband and children in east London and two years ago, she was told her building has flammable Grenfell-style cladding. 

It’s taken an emotional and financial toll on Lucy, who’s struggled to sleep since finding out her home is unsafe. 

The family are worried about a fire breaking out and as a precaution they run fire drills with the children and have taught them what to do in the case of a fire. 

Five years after the Grenfell Tower fire - which killed 72 people - hundreds of thousands of people continue to live in unsafe buildings in the UK. 

Earlier this week, the UK government announced a long-awaited pledge to help cladding victims. 

New legislation would require the building developers and manufacturers who created the Grenfell-style cladding to cover the full cost required to make buildings safe again. 

Lucy and many others who are living with cladding still feel uncertain about whether this pledge will cover the full cost it takes to make their homes safe.

"""A lot of pictures of homeless people are really sad. I didn’t want to do that. There is some joy in these people, and that’s what I wanted to show.""

New York photographer, @billbernstein, says he was feeling 'helpless' about the city's problem with homelessness – and he wanted to do something to bring a little attention to the issue.

Bernstein used to help serve dinner at the Bowery Mission, a Christian rescue centre, around Thanksgiving and Christmas time - and asked organisers if he could do some portraits of their regular users.

He says: ""I was interested when couples arrived at the centre as it was clear that they lived together on the streets. These guys were such a great pair. When they smiled, I was like: that’s the picture.

""My plan was to focus on faces and eyes, because we so often walk down the street and see somebody and we don’t want to actually look at them or engage.""

Bernstein says he wanted to capture the togetherness of the couple and to give a sense of what their relationship felt like.

""I think they felt really special having all the lights and cameras and attention on them when doing this project. I hope that feeling lasted for a while.""

"""If you find yourself holding a Maya Angelou quarter, may you be reminded of her words, ‘be certain that you do not die without having done something wonderful for humanity.’”

The late poet and activist, Maya Angelou has become the first Black woman ever to appear on a US quarter, after a coin featuring her image went into circulation on Monday.

With her arms uplifted, a bird in flight and a rising sun behind her, the US Mint said the image (pictured on the second slide) was “inspired by her poetry and symbolic of the way she lived”. A portrait of George Washington appears on the “heads” side. 

The poet and writer, who died in 2014, was the author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, in which she wrote about the racial discrimination she experienced growing up. 

The author of 36 books – and the recipient of more than 20 honorary degrees – she read her poem On the Pulse of the Morning at Bill Clinton’s 1992 inauguration, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2010.

The Angelou quarter is the first in the US Mint’s American Women Quarters programme, which will include the physicist and first female astronaut Dr Sally Ride and Wilma Mankiller, the first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, later this year. The American public was invited to submit names of iconic women for the programme after a bill put forward by Democrat congresswoman Barbara Lee.

“I am proud to have led this effort to honour these phenomenal women, who more often than not are overlooked in our country’s telling of history,"" said Lee.

""If you find yourself holding a Maya Angelou quarter, may you be reminded of her words, ‘be certain that you do not die without having done something wonderful for humanity.’”

"Do you remember what you were doing in May 2020?

Boris Johnson has been accused of an “utterly outrageous” breach of lockdown rules again - as a leaked email showed one of his top officials invited more than 100 Downing Street staff to a “bring your own booze” party during the first lockdown. The police are now investigating.

The British prime minister is believed to have attended the No 10 garden party on 20 May 2020 along with Carrie Johnson, then his fiancee, after it was advertised by his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds.

“Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” the email seen by ITV News said.

It invited just over 100 employees to the gathering at a time when social mixing was banned except with one other person from another household outdoors in a public place.

The party came five days after a 15 May 2020 “wine and pizza” party in Downing Street in the garden and inside No 10, reported by the Guardian in December, with staff drinking late into the evening.

Johnson will now come under huge pressure to explain his own role in the gathering, whether he played any part in the invitation given the phrase “we thought it would be nice” and why his office did not listen to alleged warnings from his former aide, Dominic Cummings, that it appeared to be against the rules. Cummings revealed the existence of the 20 May party in a blog on Friday.

Johnson’s spokesperson declined to comment in light of a continuing inquiry into potential breaches of lockdown in Downing Street. No 10 did not deny this weekend that Johnson and his wife, Carrie, whom he married in May 2021, attended the event.

"The photographs of an infant boy, handed in desperation to a US soldier over the wall at Kabul airport, became one of the defining images of the chaos of the American evacuation of Afghanistan.

The baby, Sohail Ahmadi, was just two months old when he went missing on 19 August as thousands of people rushed to leave the country as it fell to the Taliban.

Sohail has now been found and reunited with his relatives.

Following a Reuters story published in November with his pictures, he was located in Kabul, where a taxi driver named Hamid Safi had found him alone and crying on the ground at the airport.

After he said he unsuccessfully tried to locate the baby’s parents inside, he decided to take the infant home to his wife and children.

During the tumultuous Afghan evacuation, Mirza Ali Ahmadi – the boy’s father, who had worked as a security guard at the US embassy – and his wife, Suraya, feared their son would be crushed in the crowd as they neared the airport gates.

He said in early November that in his desperation that day, he handed Sohail over the airport wall to a uniformed soldier, fully expecting he would soon make it the remaining five metres to the entrance to reclaim him. At that moment, Taliban forces pushed the crowd back and by the time Ahmadi, his wife and their four other children were able to get inside Sohail was nowhere to be found.

Ahmadi said he searched desperately for his son and was told by officials that he had likely been taken out of the country separately and could be reunited with them later. The family was evacuated to America.

With no US embassy in Afghanistan and international organisations overstretched, Afghan refugees have had trouble getting answers on the timing, or possibility, of complex reunifications like this one.

After more than seven weeks of negotiations, Safi handed the child back to his jubilant grandfather and other relatives on Saturday.

Sohail's parents said they were overjoyed to see the reunion over video chat - and their son will soon be brought to the US.

"Who keeps the dog after divorce?

That is something the Spanish courts will now decide under a new law that considers a pet's welfare when couples divorce or break-up.

The legal shift comes after similar moves in France and Portugal and obliges judges to consider pets as sentient beings rather than objects or property owned by one or the other partner - something that is still in place in most countries.

""Animals are part of the family and when a family decides to separate, the fate of the animal must be regulated with the same importance as the fate of other family members,"" said lawyer Lola Garcia, 42.

In October, a Madrid judge gave joint custody of a dog to an unmarried couple who sought a court ruling on whom the pet should stay with after they separated. The dog spends a month with each of them and both are legally responsible.

Previously, a lawyer seeking joint custody of a pet had to prove both members of a couple owned the animal as an object, giving whoever had registered the pet an advantage.

Garcia, whose Rights&Animals firm handled the case, considers the reform a major first step in a series of forthcoming legal changes governing people's relationship with animals.

Now a judge has to determine where the animal will fare better and that determination is based on the animal's wellbeing Garcia explained.

A partner that can demonstrate financial solvency or who has been granted custody of their children has a better chance of securing custody of any pets too, as there is a special affective link between children and animals, she added.

"“We have lost an icon. A hero, a mentor, a fighter, a national treasure.”

Sidney Poitier, whose pioneering acting work in the 1950s and 60s paved the way for generations of black film stars, has died aged 94.

Poitier was the first Black person to win a best actor Oscar for his role in Lilies of the Field - and gave a string of groundbreaking performances on screen that helped combat social prejudice.

His death was announced on Friday by the minister of foreign affairs of the Bahamas, Fred Mitchell. The country's deputy prime minister, Chester Cooper, said he was “conflicted with great sadness and a sense of celebration when I learned of the passing of Sir Sidney Poitier”.

He added: “Sadness that he would no longer be here to tell him how much he means to us, but celebration that he did so much to show the world that those from the humblest beginnings can change the world and that we gave him his flowers while he was with us.

“We have lost an icon. A hero, a mentor, a fighter, a national treasure.”

Born to Bahamian parents while they were visiting Miami to sell tomatoes in 1927, Poitier grew up in the Bahamas – then a British colony – before returning to the US aged 15 and working at a series of low-paid jobs before briefly serving in the army during the second world war (and attempting to feign insanity to win a medical discharge).

"By the time you are reading this, the bosses of Britain’s biggest companies have made more money than the average UK worker will in the entire year, according to analysis of the vast gap in pay between FTSE 100 chief executives and everyone else in the country.

The High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, said that by 9am on Friday, the fourth working day of 2022, a FTSE 100 chief executive will have been paid more on an hourly basis than the UK worker’s annual salary, based on median average remuneration figures for both groups.

FTSE 100 chief executives were paid £2.7m on average in 2020, which are the latest full-year figures available. This works out at 86 times the £31,285 average salary for full-time UK workers, according to Office for National Statistics figures.

Most FTSE 100 companies have not yet announced CEO pay for their financial year ending in 2021, but 57% of those that have done so have recorded an increase on 2020 levels, the High Pay Centre report said.

Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which represents 600,000 workers, said the figures showed that bosses were paid 173 times the amount collected by carers who risked their lives on the frontline of the pandemic.

"Just a normal day in Washington? 

That’s how some Republicans have been portraying the Capitol attack, which happened one year ago today.

In their attempts to downplay what happened, they’ve called the rioters “peaceful protesters”, and even likened the attack to “a normal tourist visit” and “one day in January”.

But the reality couldn’t be more different. Five people died, scores of police were beaten and bloodied, and there was about $1.5m in damage in the first major attack on the Capitol since the war of 1812. More than 700 people have subsequently been charged in one of the biggest criminal investigations in American history.

Not all Republicans agree however, and few have been as publicly vocal as senator Mitt Romney. “What happened was a violent effort to interfere with and prevent the constitutional order of installing a new president,” he said in May.

Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, also sees the riot in a different light to some of his colleagues. “They have to rewrite the history because that’s the only way they can justify their existence,” he told the Guardian. “Because if you let the actual facts of history speak to the truth of who they are, then I don’t know how they look themselves in the face in the morning.”",2022-01-06 19:10:16

"""You are capable of anything you want.""

Preet Chandi, thought to be the first woman of colour to complete a solo crossing on Antarctica, has finished her expedition to the south pole almost a week ahead of schedule.

Chandi or “Polar Preet”, endured temperatures of -50C as she skied 700 miles across Antarctica in 40 days, seven hours and three minutes, narrowly missing out on setting a new world record by a woman for the trek.

She finished just behind the time set by Johanna Davidsson of Sweden, who finished in 38 days, 23 hours and five minutes in 2016.

Chandi, 32, is now the third-fastest female solo skier for the expedition behind Davidsson and Britain’s Hannah McKeand, who recorded a time of 39 days, nine hours and 33 minutes in 2006.

She is also the first person to reach the south pole on foot in two years.

Chandi, a British Army physiotherapist who lives in Derby, said she hoped her journey would inspire young people, women and those from minority-ethnic backgrounds. Speaking to the Guardian during her training for the trek, she said people did not expect an Asian woman to attempt such an endeavour.

“I am an Asian woman; I’m not the image that people expect to see out there,” she said. “People say the outdoors is for everyone and yes, it is. But if you come from a community that is not involved in it at all, or you don’t see anybody that looks like you doing it, it can be really hard.”

After completing the trek, she plans to set up an adventure grant to help more women fund expeditions in what is often a male-dominated arena.

"France's president, Emmanuel Macron, has vowed to make daily life more and more difficult for people who have yet to take the Covid vaccine.

“I am not about pissing off the French people,” the president said in an interview with readers of Le Parisien daily on Tuesday. “But as for the non-vaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And we will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy.”

Macron’s remarks came as the French parliament debated new legislation that, if passed, will mean only the fully vaccinated, and no longer those with a negative Covid test, will qualify for the country’s health pass from next month.

The pass, introduced this summer, is required in France for access to indoor public places such as cafes, restaurants, cinemas, museums, concert venues and sports centres, as well as to board long-distance trains and planes.

France has vaccinated almost 90% of its population who are eligible, Macron said, and it was “only a very small minority who are resisting.""

But his comments have sparked a furore among his political opponents, who accused the president of excessive language.

The vaccine pass has been criticised by both right-wing and radical left parties as a collective punishment against individual liberties.

Polls show a large majority of French voters are growing increasingly frustrated with the pandemic and back the vaccine pass as an effective means to end it, they said – and of those who oppose it, very few are likely to cast their ballot for Macron.

"Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the blood testing company Theranos, has been found guilty on four charges of fraud – a verdict that will probably land her in prison and have major implications for Silicon Valley.

Theranos sold a promise to improve health with tests on one drop of blood – a claim that despite having little scientific proof raised hundreds of millions of dollars and attracted big-name investors such as the media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.

Holmes, once the world’s youngest female self-made billionaire, was acquitted on three charges relating to patients who received inaccurate test results but found guilty on four charges, including one count of conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud against investors. Holmes is expected to appeal. The jury remained deadlocked on three of the charges. 

The split verdicts are “a mixed bag for the prosecution, but it’s a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years”, said David Ring, a lawyer who has followed the case closely.

It also marks a milestone for Silicon Valley – an industry that has for years evaded accountability in its pervasive culture of “fake it ‘til you make it” that encourages founders to make big promises, often with little proof.

It is an approach to photography that emphasises beauty of subject matter, tonality, and composition rather than the documentation of reality.

During the second world war, troves of works by west coast pictorialists were lost. In the aftermath of the the surprise attack by Japan on the US naval base at Pearl Harbour in 1941, the lives of innumerable Japanese Americans were upended - under the Enemy Alien Act cameras were considered contraband when found in their possession.

Because of the tremendous loss of material and documentation from the era, the contributions of Japanese Americans to the development of art photography in the US were vastly underestimated in early histories.

But a new exhibition shows just how influential they were - and how these photographers helped lay the groundwork for moody urban pictures.

"How old do you think children should be when their parent starts talking to them about porn and sexual harassment?

According to the children’s commissioner for England, it should be when they are as young as nine or 10 - and ideally before they have a smartphone or social media account.

It comes after @billieeilish revealed last month the 'devastating' impact watching porn from an early age had on her. The Grammy-winning singer said she started at 11 and developed an addiction that gave her nightmares and made dating difficult.

Concern has only been growing about the ease of access to and damaging impact of online pornography on young children who often browse the internet unsupervised and are exposed to material that shows degradation and violence towards women.

And the children’s commissioner's guide has highlighted the gap between what parents think and their children’s reality. Only a quarter of parents think their child has seen pornography online, but in reality more than half of 11- to 13-year-olds have already seen porn, many came across it by accident and 62% say their viewing of porn is mostly unintentional.

"Which loo with a view is your number one? ... or number two?

Be it the crest of an icy mountain peak, the depths of the dense native bush, or the slopes of sleeping volcanoes, New Zealand’s wild and remote landscapes are coveted by outdoor enthusiasts the world over.

But what really sets the country’s nature apart from the rest is what is at one’s disposal when nature calls – spectacular loos with views.

These scenic spots – small, remote, and lacking in plumbing – are a curious quirk in New Zealand’s landscape, and offer up some of the best panoramas in the country.

The department of conservation is responsible for the extensive network of landscape latrines and holds the unusual gong of “managing more toilets than any other organisation in New Zealand”.

Many of the impressive long-drops are linked to some of the 970 huts dotted through the more remote and striking parts of the country, and require helicopters to fly the waste out.

The department says it is looking at ways of reducing helicopter flying to reduce cost and carbon emissions.

The oldest toilet is believed to be a 90-year-old pit toilet at an old farm homestead now managed by the department as part of Rakiura national park called “Island Hill Run” on Rakiura/Stewart Island.

The toilet with the most impressive altitude is at Empress Hut, 2,500m up New Zealand’s highest mountain, Aoraki/Mt Cook in the Southern Alps.

So if you're bogged down with your mediocre toilet views, head to New Zealand for the best seat in the house ... if you're ready to take the plunge.

"""If I close my eyes and think of Stephen Sondheim, I remember him in my kitchen just talking about life, about dogs.""

For our series remembering cultural figures we lost in 2021, British actor Imelda Staunton pays tribute to the great American composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim.

Staunton, who has appeared in productions of Sondheim’s classic musicals Into the Woods, Sweeney Todd, and Gypsy places him in theatre history as: “the last of the big boys, the final link with the great American songbook, a man with personal connections to Oscar Hammerstein and Leonard Bernstein.”

She came to know him as a friend and remembers his generosity with actors, directors and producers and how he always had time for younger cast members.

“He never made you feel inadequate,” she says. “He only ever wanted all of us to be our very best.” She also explains the great gift in his work to a performer: “His work is not about how the songs sound. It’s how they feel… He wrote monologues and then, in the music, he gave you the rhythm and the heartbeat of each one.”

"Peeing in space is 'very easy' ...

That's according to Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa who has recently returned to Earth after spending 12 days on the International Space station (ISS).

@yusaku2020 documented his space travel earlier this month and made videos performing mundane tasks, including eating snacks and going to the toilet.

Maezawa is an online fashion tycoon who was helped into space by a Russian space agency team. His assistant Yozo Hirano and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin also joined his crew alongside a seven-team crew who were engaged in space biology and physics research.

The journey marked Russia’s return to space tourism after a decade-long pause that saw the rise of competition from the US as the commercial space tourism industry is growing.

This year, billionaires Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson all made breakthrough commercial tourism flights, bursting into a market Russia is keen to defend.

The cost of tickets to space for tourists has not been disclosed but US-based company Space Adventures has indicated they are in the range of $50m-60m.

"Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel peace prize laureate and veteran of South Africa's struggle against white minority rule, has died aged 90.

Tutu, described by foreign observers and his countrymen as the moral conscience of his nation, passed away in Cape Town on Boxing Day.

“The passing of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” president Cyril Ramaphosa said.

Tutu was born in October 1931 and ordained an Anglican priest in 1961. He was thrust into the limelight in 1978, when he was appointed secretary-general of the South African Council of Churches.

Excitable, emotional, charismatic and highly articulate, Tutu won the Nobel peace prize in 1984. A vocal supporter of sanctions against South Africa, he was detested by supporters of the apartheid regime, who saw him as an agitator and traitor.

Tutu was however protected not just by his wit and combative spirit but by his immense popularity and respect. In 1986 he was appointed archbishop of Cape Town, the effective head of the Anglican church in his homeland.

After the nation’s first free election in 1994, Nelson Mandela, who had become the president of a free South Africa, asked Tutu to chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the controversial and emotional hearings into apartheid-era human rights abuses.

""Sometimes strident, often tender, never afraid and seldom without humour, Desmond Tutu's voice will always be the voice of the voiceless,"" is how Mandela, who died in December 2013, described his friend.

Tutu, who retired from most public duties in October 2010, is still seen as a voice of integrity. ""The Arch"", as he is affectionately known, will be remembered as one of the leading lights of the struggle against apartheid who was not afraid to condemn injustice wherever he saw it.

"For our series paying tribute to cultural figures who passed away in 2021, Otis Williams, founder of the Temptations, remembers his fiercely determined Motown colleague Mary Wilson, who lit up the stage with the Supremes and fought for artists’ rights.

“Our careers went in parallel in many aspects, and that bonded us as friends,” he says. “Our bands were known together as Motown’s no-hit wonders – neither of us had a hit until late 1963, which was hard.

But Mary had a lot of determination. She’d throw everything into her performances. We’d sing in nightclubs together and I’d watch her from the side of the stage, notice how hard she was working.”

When Diana Ross left the band, Wilson fought to keep copyright of the Supremes’ name and went on to help draft the historic Truth In Music bill, protecting the trademark of a band name for original members.

Wilson kept working on music until her death; Williams spoke to her just a few weeks before he heard she had gone. “She said to me: “I’m still your Mary’... I know she loved being part of Motown, singing those songs that will outlive us all.”",2021-12-23 10:00:06

"As we look back on 2021, this image stays so prominently in our minds.

It shows Ndakasi, an orphaned mountain gorilla living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, lying in the arms of her caregiver, Andre Bauma, taking her final breath. She died aged 14 in September after a prolonged illness.

Ndakasi was just two months old when rangers found her clinging to the lifeless body of her mother, who had been gunned down by armed militia in 2007. Bauma comforted her that first night by holding her to his bare chest and had continued caring for her since then.

This hauntingly powerful image reminds us of what our relationship with animals can be - and how significant these are.

Ndakasi, who famously posed in the background of a selfie taken by rangers at Virunga national park, was transferred to the Senkwekwe Center after its creation in 2009 and lived with other orphaned mountain gorillas viewed as too vulnerable to return to the wild.

A number of the orphans here were rescued from sales by poachers in sting operations carried out by Congolese National Park Authority (ICCN) rangers.

Virunga national park in eastern DRC is home to some of the world’s last mountain gorillas. Neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda are also home to mountain gorillas, and together their population has recently risen to more than 1,000.

Nearly 700 rangers in Virunga park risk their lives to protect its wildlife in a region that has faced more than two decades of armed conflict and instability.

Mr Bauma and others at the Senkwekwe Center had cared for Ndakasi and other orphans for 13 years. This is the only mountain gorilla orphanage in the world and takes in mountain gorilla orphans who have lost their families to poaching or conflict.

“It was a privilege to support and care for such a loving creature,” Bauma said in a statement when this image was released in October.

“It was Ndakasi’s sweet nature and intelligence that helped me to understand the connection between humans and great apes and why we should do everything in our power to protect them.”

Bauma said he was proud to have called Ndakasi a friend.

"Have you struggled with the lack of daylight in the past few months?

Yesterday marked the winter solstice in the UK and the rest of the northern hemisphere, which is the shortest period of daylight in the year, and the first official day of winter.

That means from today, the amount of daylight we get each day will keep increasing until we reach the summer solstice on 21 June next year.

The situation is the reverse in the Southern Hemisphere. There, the December solstice marks the longest day of the year -- and the beginning of summer in places such as Australia, Chile and South Africa.

Many people dread winter because of the darkness it brings with it, and the resulting seasonal depression known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

One in three people suffer from SAD in the UK, according to a 2014 study. Most people start to get symptoms for the first time in their 20s or 30s, and women are about four times more likely to have SAD than men.

“SAD is a huge problem at the best of times, and this is not the best of times,” said Norman Rosenthal, the doctor who named the disorder after research inspired by the effects of winter on his own mood.

He is concerned that people already suffering from the effects of a pandemic that has had a dire effect on mental health might have found their unhappiness amplified during the darker days of winter.

Ancient peoples whose survival depended on a precise knowledge of seasonal cycles marked the winter solstice with ceremonies and celebrations.

The UK's most famous site for solstice celebrations is Stonehenge. On the winter solstice, visitors traditionally have been able to enter the mysterious stone circle for a sunrise ceremony run by local pagan and druid groups.

Polish photographer Jędrzej Nowicki has worked to capture both in his project, The Scars, a record of what is now known as the largest anti-government unrest in the history of Belarus.

Huge protests started in August 2020 and left deep traces on Belarusian society. The president, Alexander Lukashenko, and his state apparatus responded with extreme brutality to the Belarusian resistance.

What is now happening in the country will also leave deep scars in the social fabric. A division into two Belarusian states is already emerging.

The protagonists of these photos are protesters beaten by the regime, families whose relatives have been tortured by the security services, or citizens who oppose violence and want freedom. But also soldiers dragged into the middle of a conflict that was never theirs.

"The UK, Canada, Germany and other EU states have supported a deliberate policy to withhold vaccines from the poorest countries in the world, and defended an immoral and unethical economic system which places big pharma patents ahead of millions of lives, writes former director at the World Health Organization, Anthony Costello.

""Millions more people will die from Covid-19 in the coming year, and most will be unvaccinated. The vaccines that could save millions of lives are not reaching the poor majority of the world’s population.

""The contrast is stark: the current share of people fully vaccinated in high, upper-middle income, lower-middle income and low income countries is 69%, 68%, 30% and 3.5% respectively.""

This map shows the huge inequality in the roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines across the globe. It shows the number of doses administered per 100 people over time until 8 December this year.

Vaccines help stem transmission and reduce the number of host bodies available for further mutations to take place. Being a very globalised planet with people travelling from around the world all the time, only vaccinating certain countries is a roll of the dice again and again on variants, as Omicron makes clear.

It didn’t have to be this way. Around 12bn doses are forecast to be produced by the end of this year. Had a principle of vaccine equity governed the global rollout, this could have comfortably vaccinated every adult in the world.

"""You can’t help but feel exploited."" 

The actor Claire Foy has revealed how she struggled with filming the sex scenes for the latest adaptation of A Very British Scandal, in which she stars as a duchess whose private life became the subject of salacious gossip during her divorce proceedings.

“It’s a really hard line because basically you do feel exploited when you are a woman and you are having to perform fake sex on screen. You can’t help but feel exploited.

""It’s grim – it’s the grimmest thing you can do. You feel exposed. Everyone can make you try to not feel that way but it’s unfortunately the reality.

“But my thing was that I felt very strongly that it had to be in it, but I wanted it to be female. I did not want it be that sort of awful climactic sexual experience you often see on the cinema screen,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour.

Foy plays Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, who was famed for her charisma, beauty and style and who suffered the publication of explicit photographs after her husband sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery.

The 1963 hearing focused heavily on the duchess’s sex life, with her husband Ian Campbell publicly estimating the number of men with whom he believed she had had sex, as well as providing explicit pictures purporting to show her in the act.

The duchess was criticised by the judge, who denounced her in his judgment as a “highly sexed woman”. The fact that the couple had an open marriage her husband had also exploited and that he had stolen her private property and reportedly sought the divorce only when she stopped paying his bills was deemed largely irrelevant.

Responding to the suggestion that the duchess was the first woman to be publicly “slut-shamed” by the media, Foy dismissed the term. 

She said: “I hate the phrase slut-shaming, I absolutely hate it. But I think that women have basically been slut-shamed forever. I think Eve was probably slut-shamed.”

"Wanted: someone with experience running a pub, a love of isolation and a willingness to mark their appointment by sitting on a throne and having beer poured over their head.

A council has begun one of the UK’s most unusual local government recruitment processes while looking for someone to run the Ship Inn on Piel Island, off the coast near Barrow-in-Furness in the North-west of England.

Whoever is in charge of the pub is crowned “King of Piel” in a ceremony involving a rusty sabre which concludes with buckets of beer being poured over their head. Any punter who unwittingly sits on the throne has to buy drinks for everyone.

Barrow borough council is seeking to a recruit a landlord, on a 10-year lease, in time for the season starting in April. As well as running the pub the successful applicant will need to manage and maintain the island itself.

Many people go to the island for birthday parties or for a few drinks before camping overnight.

John Murphy has been leading walks to the island for nearly 40 years and says whoever gets the job will need to be “massively dedicated”.

“You can’t just nip across to Tesco for a loaf of bread when you’re on Piel Island,” he said. “You’ll need to have dedication and a strong passion for isolation and peace and quiet. It takes a special personality.”

Murphy would love the job himself but, at 73, says he is too old. He has handed the job of leading walks to the island to younger legs, but he still intends to be on Piel telling its stories.

“I absolutely adore Piel Island, I adore its isolation. I also love the fact that Barrow still is an industrial town and yet we have this gorgeous, isolated island within spitting distance.”

"Four months ago, 35-year-old Gabriel Boric confounded the polls to claim victory in a presidential primary he had barely been old enough to compete in. 

But on 11 March next year, he will now be sworn in as Chile’s youngest ever president – having amassed more votes than any presidential candidate in history.

Boric is the driving force behind Chile’s abrupt changing of the guard. He belongs to a radical generation of student leaders who are grimly determined to bury dictator Augusto Pinochet’s bitter legacy once and for all.

“Chile was the birthplace of neoliberalism, and it shall also be its grave!” he shouted from a stage the night of his primary win, his forearm tattoo peeking out from beneath a rolled-up sleeve.

Neoliberalism sees competition as the defining characteristic of human relations. It redefines citizens as consumers, whose democratic choices are best exercised by buying and selling, a process that rewards merit and punishes inefficiency. It maintains that “the market” delivers benefits that could never be achieved by planning.

Boric said his generation wanted to have its rights respected and not be treated “like consumer goods or a business”, adding the country would no longer allow Chile’s poor to “keep paying the price” of inequality.

"At first glance, it has all the hallmarks of a laid-back post-work social gathering on an uncommonly warm British spring evening.

But there is a lot more to this image.

Boris Johnson was pictured with wine and cheese alongside his then-fiancé, Carrie, who appears to be holding their newborn baby, and up to 17 staff in the Downing Street garden on 15 May 2020 during lockdown.

The photo was shared with the Guardian after No 10’s denial last week that there was a social event on that day, which included wine, spirits and pizza, inside and outside the building.

Johnson’s spokesperson said Downing Street staff were working in the garden in the afternoon and evening.

However, the picture raises questions over that assertion. Bottles of wine are in evidence, there is a lack of social distancing and 19 people are gathered in groups across the terrace and lawn.

At the time social mixing between households was limited to two people, who could only meet outdoors and at a distance of at least 2 metres. In workplaces, guidance said in-person meetings should only take place if “absolutely necessary”.

Angela Rayner, the deputy leader of the Labour party, described the picture as “a slap in the face of the British public”.

The prime minister has faced a string of allegations of partying and socialising in No 10 while Covid restrictions were in place. He was forced to order a civil service inquiry, though its head stepped down on Friday over allegations of his own Christmas party.

On the same day as the image above was taken, Matt Hancock, then health secretary, had given a 5pm press conference urging people to stick to the rules and not take advantage of the good weather over the May weekend to socialise in groups.

The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said funerals at that time were allowed fewer people in attendance than there appeared to be in the Downing Street garden, and it was “exhausting” to see the “constant, flagrant disregard we have all been held in”.

"In Haiti, the world’s first black-led republic, joumou soup stands for hope, liberation and dignity.

Before the country's independence, enslaved African people were forced to cook this dish for their owners - and were banned from eating it.

But after the nation freed themselves from French colonial control, joumou soup became the national symbol of liberation from slavery - and on Thursday it was added to Unesco’s prestigious list of intangible cultural heritage - established in 2008 to protect national traditions.

In 2020, 35 entries were added to the list, including sauna culture in Finland, sourdough making in Malta, budima dancing in Zambia and a grass mowing competition in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is Haiti’s first inclusion on the list and the country’s Unesco ambassador, Dominique Dupuy, cried as the announcement was made.

The nomination of joumou soup was considered on compassionate grounds, after the country’s difficult year. President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated in July, and a devastating 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the country in August.

The country's delegation to Unesco said the listing was “not only a fabulous sign of hope and encouragement, but also a unifying call, for a Haitian people currently facing an exceptionally difficult moment in their rich history”.

A representative from Switzerland said joumou soup was being listed not only on compassionate grounds, but because of its quality.

"""Sean was a superb writer of comedy, a clever and rigorous practitioner of the art, who saw it as something to be crafted, to be treated almost like poetry.""

For our end-of-year special series paying tribute to cultural figures we lost in 2021, comedian Bill Bailey recalls more than 30 years of friendship with Sean Lock - a warm and generous writer and performer whose standup sets left audiences ""helpless with laughter"".

""I met Sean at a gig where we were both performing in the late 80s and we immediately hit it off,"" says Bailey. ""We shared a similar sense of humour, and also a sense of outsider status which gave us an added spur to succeed but with a determination to have fun while doing it.

""The fact that we were able to make people laugh, and make a living from it, felt like we were on a wild adventure that we didn’t want to end.

""Away from the world of TV and entertainment, he was a dedicated and loving family man. He was a great host, an excellent cook, and was never happier than pottering around in the kitchen preparing a fish stew, while dancing to dub reggae.

""Sean had that rare knack of truly great comics to be able to take audiences with him on ever more tortuous and often quite dark routes, yet such was the warmth of his personality and easy manner that crowds happily followed along, and his reputation grew.""

""He was as funny off stage as on. I will remember a kind, generous and loyal friend who I loved dearly, and feel a great sadness at his loss. He leaves a wife, Anoushka, and their three children, his sister Kate and his brothers Paul and Pete. And he leaves us all a wonderful comic legacy and – for me and those lucky enough to have known him – some cherished memories and unforgettable nights of laughter.""",2021-12-18 15:00:06

"This is the story of Rajan, the last ocean-swimming elephant, along with the fascinating background to this powerful image:

In the 1970s, Rajan was brought to the Andaman Islands, an Indian territory in the Bay of Bengal, with nine other elephants to help log the islands; all were forced to learn how to swim in the ocean.

Elephants love fresh water but they don’t like salt water because it stings their eyes and dries their skin. The elephants would drag the giant cut badak trees and swim them out to barges.

Once an island was logged, the elephants would be made to swim to the next island. They’d sometimes swim miles, which was mind-blowing: a group of 10 elephants swimming in open ocean.

When logging was banned in 2002, Rajan was out of a job.

He was the last elephant of the group to survive and lived out his days on Havelock (now Swaraj) Island until his death in 2016.

When @jodymacdonaldphoto met Rajan, he was around 60 years old, living out his retirement with Nazroo, his caretaker, who in India is called a mahout.

The Canadian photographer says: ""Every morning, Rajan would go into the jungle or walk down to the beach. He went swimming whenever he felt like it. He seemed to have adapted to swimming in salt water and even to enjoy it. I truly felt like he was having fun swimming in the ocean. I think that comes across in this picture. Many people tell me it looks like he’s smiling.""

MacDonald took this photo on one of the rare occasions Rajan went on a longer swim. ""He’d totally immerse himself and use his trunk like a snorkel, which was so cool,"" she said, explaining she used a weight belt to freedive down and get the angle she wanted.

""Spending time with Rajan was an amazing experience. He was probably the last ocean-swimming elephant we’ll ever see, which gives the image extra poignancy.

""As logging bans have increased, using elephants for logging has significantly diminished. I think it still happens in some Asian countries, but it’s a practice that’s thankfully fading.""

"Groundbreaking author and activist, bell hooks, who has died at the age of 69, inspired countless people through her writing on feminism, love, white supremacy, intersectionality, capitalism and the power of art.

Broadcaster and writer @afuahirsch commented that “reading bell hooks was an experience of profound relief. She had powerfully identified and articulated, with characteristic intellectual rigour, phenomena which I instinctively perceived but had never seen vocalised.”

hooks’ first major work, Ain’t I a Woman?, was published in 1981, and became widely recognised as an important feminist text and named one of the 20 most influential women’s books in the last two decades by Publishers Weekly in 1992.

"If you've ever heard Logic's song, 1-800-273-8255, which is the number for the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, you will know how powerful the lyrics are.

Now, research has found that the track led to a ""notable"" rise in calls to the helpline and may have reduced the number of suicides in America.

1-800-273-8255 generated strong public attention upon its release in April 2017 and notable performances at the MTV Video Music Awards and the Grammys.

A new study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) showed that following these events an additional 9,915 calls were recorded and there was evidence of a reduction in the number of US suicides.

“All these events gave widespread public attention to the message of the song – that help from Lifeline is available and effective,” the researchers said.

“Suicide prevention and education efforts must harness positive media to educate the general public and high risk groups about suicide prevention without doing harm to individuals at risk.

“But a major dilemma for research in this area has been that stories of hope and recovery receive much less media coverage than stories of suicide death.”

Analysis found that @logic's song was associated with a call volume increase of 6.9% to Lifeline during the 34-day period when public attention to the song was substantial.

1-800-273-8255's release was also associated with a nearly 10% rise in online Google searches for Lifeline in the 28 days after release.

In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

"Just days after a heartbreaking defeat, Lewis Hamilton is now Sir Lewis Hamilton. The Formula One driver was knighted by Prince Charles in Windsor today in recognition of his glittering career.

Over the weekend, he controversially finished second at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix - missing out on a record eighth drivers’ crown by the narrowest of margins – but no driver in history has won more races than him.

@lewishamilton was included in the new year honours list following a record-breaking 2020 in which he eclipsed Michael Schumacher’s all-time victory tally and emulated the German by winning a seventh world title.

The 36-year-old becomes the fourth grand prix driver ever to receive this honour – following in the footsteps of Sir Jack Brabham, Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart - and is the first to be awarded a knighthood while still competing.

Hamilton will undoubtedly go down as one of the greats in motor racing, but, as important, he has transcended his sport and used his fame to back the social and political causes he believes in.

The British driver says the death of George Floyd last year awakened his sense of social justice. “I was in tears and this stuff came up that I’d suppressed over all these years,"" he said speaking to @garyyounge in July.

""It was so powerful and sad and also releasing. I thought: 'I can’t stay quiet.' When I did speak out, that was me letting the black community know: 'I hear you and I stand with you.'""

Hamilton has taken the knee before races, worn T-shirts supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and persuaded other drivers to join his protests. Hamilton has funded an investigation into the lack of diversity within motorsport, has also worn a rainbow helmet in countries that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community, and has spoken out against human rights abuses in countries that have hosted grands prix.

Arise, Sir Lewis.

"This aerial shot of six dead giraffes, lying in a spiral on the dry earth - their bodies emaciated and interwoven - shows the devastation of Kenya’s drought, which has left people and animals struggling for food and water.

Already weak, the animals had died after they got stuck in the mud, according to photojournalist @edr4m, who captured the image.

They were trying to reach a nearby reservoir, although it had almost dried up, the picture agency Getty reported.

The carcasses were moved to the outskirts of Eyrib village in Wajir County to prevent contamination of the reservoir water.

The local Star news website has reported that 4,000 giraffes risked being wiped out by the drought.

It is not just animals that are at risk. An estimated 2.1 million Kenyans were facing starvation due to severe drought across half the state, the country’s drought management authority warned in September.

On Tuesday, the UN said 2.9 million people were still in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Some areas of Kenya had recently reported their worst rainfall in decades, it said.

"Who would be your choice for person of the year?

Times magazine have gone for a highly controversial choice and given the accolade to Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, describing him as a “clown, genius, edgelord, visionary, industrialist and showman.""

But the decision has drawn sharp criticism because of Musk's attitude to tax, opposition to unions and playing down the dangers of Covid-19.

Musk, who is also the founder and chief executive of space exploration company SpaceX, recently passed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the world’s wealthiest person after his net worth rose to around $300bn.

Time has defended its choice, explaining that its annual acknowledgment was not an award, but rather, “recognition of the person who had the most influence on the events of the year, for good or for ill”.

The title has previously been bestowed to popes, Ebola healthcare workers and Greta Thunberg but also Hitler and Stalin, who received it twice. In 1982, it went to “The Computer”. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were Time magazine’s person – or persons – of the year for 2020.

"It's not rocket science ... or is it?

Researchers have found aerospace engineers and brain surgeons are not necessarily brighter than the general population.

After examining data from an international cohort of 329 aerospace engineers and 72 neurosurgeons - and comparing results against those previously gathered from more than 18,000 members of the British public, here is what they learned:

Researchers asked the aerospace engineers and neurosurgeons to complete 12 tasks online using the Great British Intelligence Test (GBIT) - and to answer some supporting questions. The tasks examined various aspects of cognition, including planning and reasoning, working memory, attention, and emotion processing abilities.

The findings reveal that only neurosurgeons showed a significant difference with quicker problem-solving speed but slower memory recall compared with the general population, which researchers noted ""might arise from the fast-paced nature of neurosurgery, which attracts those with a pre-existing flair for rapid processing ...""

They said the study was, in part, carried out to lay to rest the question of whether one of the professions had the intellectual upper hand – a tension made famous by the Mitchell and Webb sketch in which a swaggering neurosurgeon is slapped down by an aerospace expert who says: “Brain surgery … it’s not exactly rocket science is it?”

However, the team found few differences between the cognitive abilities of aerospace engineers and neuroscientists, although the results suggest the former had higher scores for attention and mental manipulation – such as rotating objects in one’s head – while neurosurgeons showed higher scores in semantic problem solving – such as definitions of rare words.

“Essentially what we think it shows is that everyone has a range of skills ... and it is very difficult to be better in everything across the board,” said Aswin Chari, a neurosurgical trainee at Great Ormond Street hospital and an author of the study.

Referencing the two professions, Chari added: “It is not that they are better at everything, but they are better at certain things that make them good at what they do.”

"Saudi authorities have carried out their biggest crackdown on camel beauty contestants, disqualifying more than 40 “enhanced” camels from the annual pageant, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.

The camels disqualified in the competition, at the King Abdulaziz camel festival, were judged to have received Botox injections and other artificial touch-ups.

The festival, which started this month, invites the breeders of the most beautiful camels to compete for about $66m in prize money.

Botox injections, facelifts and other cosmetic alterations to make the camels more attractive are strictly prohibited. Jurors decide the winner based on the shape of the animals’ heads, necks, humps, dress, and postures.

Judges at the month-long festival, held in the desert north-east of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, are escalating their clampdown on artificially enhanced camels, the official news agency reported, using “specialised and advanced” technology to detect tampering.

This year, the authorities discovered dozens of breeders had stretched out the lips and noses of camels, used hormones to boost the animals’ muscles, injected heads and lips with Botox to make them bigger, inflated body parts with rubber bands, and used fillers to relax their faces.

“The club is keen to halt all acts of tampering and deception in the beautification of camels,” the SPA report said, adding organisers would “impose strict penalties on manipulators”.

The camel beauty contest is at the heart of the massive carnival, which also features camel races, sales and other festivities typically showcasing thousands of dromedaries.

Camel breeding is a multimillion-dollar industry - and events like this seek to preserve the camel’s role in the Bedouin tradition and heritage as the oil-rich country ploughs ahead with modernising mega projects.

"What do you think of this contest?

Ten teachers were pitted against each other to scramble for dollar bills to fund school supplies in a city in South Dakota.

The competition has been described as “demeaning” and drawn comparisons with the Netflix hit series Squid Game.

The local newspaper the Argus Leader reported $5,000 (£3,770) in single dollar bills were laid out on the ice skating rink during the Sioux Falls Stampede hockey game on Saturday night, and the teachers from nearby schools competed to grab as many as possible in less than five minutes.

Footage of the competition that went viral on social media showed teachers stuffing the notes down their jumpers and into hats while the audience cheered.

The money was reportedly donated by CU Mortgage Direct to fund teaching supplies and classroom repairs.

“With everything that has gone on for the last couple of years with teachers and everything, we thought it was an awesome group thing to do for the teachers,” Ryan Knudson, a marketing spokesperson for CU Mortgage Direct, told the Argus Leader.

The American Federation of Teachers president, Randi Weingarten, tweeted that the display ""just feels demeaning"", adding that: ""No doubt people probably intended it to be fun, but from the outside it feels terrible.”

On social media the “dash for cash” footage was described as “humiliating” and “dystopian”. Some people likened the footage to scenes from Squid Game or the Hunger Games franchise.

The teachers involved in the competition appreciated the cash and said they planned to use it to buy flexible seating, such as standing desks or wobble chairs, or document cameras so they could upload lessons online, the Argus Leader reported.

"These satellite images show the trail of destruction left by what could prove to be the longest tornado in US history.

Joe Biden has declared a major federal disaster in Kentucky after a swarm of deadly tornadoes hit the state on Friday.

Nowhere suffered as much as Mayfield, a community of about 10,000 in the south-western corner of Kentucky.

The large twisters destroyed fire and police stations, as well as a candle factory (pictured on the cover) where 110 employees were working the night shift. Eight have been confirmed dead and eight others remained missing, said Bob Ferguson, a spokesperson for Mayfield Consumer Products, which owns the factory. He said 90 people had been located, a figure that authorities were still trying to confirm on Monday morning.

Kentucky governor Andy Beshear said the tornadoes were the most destructive in the state’s history.

“The very first thing that we have to do is grieve together and we’re going to do that before we rebuild together,” he said.

One tornado tore across 227 miles (365 km) of terrain, almost all of that in Kentucky, which if confirmed, would surpass the 218-mile Tri-State tornado in 1925, which killed at least 695 people and destroyed 15,000 homes across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.

On Sunday morning, Beshear had said that the death toll was expected to exceed 100 but later that figure had been revised down, although amid power cuts and phone services down across many communities, there was not yet certainty over numbers.

Elsewhere, the death toll from multiple tornadoes included six people in Illinois, where an Amazon depot was hit; four people in Tennessee; two in Arkansas, where a nursing home was destroyed; and two in Missouri.

Spring is the main season for tornadoes and this latest event was very unusual coming in December, when colder weather normally limits tornadoes, experts have said.

If a secondhand ""vintage"" gift was once considered cheap, it’s now an inspired choice and shows that the person giving it has put time and thought into a greener alternative.

A survey conducted by the online secondhand marketplace Vinted found that one in six of us are committed to giving preloved gifts this Christmas, and buying secondhand can also help to combat the £42m worth of unwanted Christmas gifts sent to landfill each year.

"Masses of ocean plastic are providing artificial habitat for otherwise coastal species, according to a new study.

So what exactly does this mean? And what are ""neopelagic communities""?

The authors of this new study - published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature Communications - say they observed floating water bottles, old toothbrushes and matted fishing nets - and concluded that the possibility exists that species may be evolving to better adapt to life on plastic.

A decade ago, marine researchers believed coastal organisms, which evolved to live along sheltered shorelines, could not survive a trip across the inhospitable open ocean.

Yet Japan’s 2011 tsunami, which sent some 300 species of Asian marine life riding durable and buoyant plastic garbage onto North American shores, disproved that assumption.

Now, scientists believe seafaring colonies of anemones, brittle stars, shrimp, barnacles and more, are thriving on plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and washing up wherever the currents take them.

Ocean plastic is “… creating opportunities for coastal species’ biogeography to greatly expand beyond what we previously thought was possible”, Linsey Haram, a research associate at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and coauthor of the study, said.

But the sheer density of plastic in the ocean is still a great concern, according to marine ecotoxicologist experts like Juan José Alava, PhD at the University of British Columbia.

While small species can make a life for themselves within these permanent floating plastic structures, they also attract creatures higher up the food chain, like fish, turtles and larger mammals, who through curiosity become caught and entangled in the plastic and die.

“The 2021 UN report after Cop26 was clear that the scale of rapidly increasing plastic pollution is putting the health of all the world’s oceans and seas at risk,” says Alava.

"This is a quote from a former seaman whose job it was to retrieve the dead bodies of Indonesian and Somalian people who lost their lives trying to seek asylum in Australia.

The seaman, anonymously identified as Witness BR2, told the royal commission into defence and veteran suicide he had been with the navy for less than a year when he was deployed on Operation Resolute.

He said its mission had been to intercept “suspect” vessels off the north coast, but none of the “rushed” training the crew had prepared them what was to come - and he was so tormented by what he saw he is still haunted by the memories 10 years later.

BR2 said the first time he and the crew had found bodies in the water they were forced to abandon them because “it was untenable due to … the decay of a body at sea after time”.

On another occasion, the crew had come across 230 Somali asylum seekers in rough seas in a vessel that looked like a “double decker bus”, he said.

“I was a pretty ignorant 21-year-old kid, thinking that these people don’t deserve to come here because why are they jumping the queue,” he said. “That changed pretty quickly meeting these people. These people … are some of the most genuine people I’ve ever met.”

BR2 told the commission he had felt a growing sense of guilt and anger because doing his job meant handing over people they’d saved “just to put them basically in prison ashore”.

He added that his attitudes towards the asylum seekers had radically changed after witnessing their desperation and suffering and the way they were being treated by the Australian government.

He also told the commission he had started drinking even more heavily to cope with his anger and distress and had daily thoughts of suicide and was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

"What do you think of New Zealand's plan to ban smoking for the next generation?

The country has announced that those who are born after 2008 will never be legally able to buy tobacco.

New legislation means the legal smoking age will increase every year, to create a smoke-free generation of New Zealanders, associate health minister Dr Ayesha Verrall said on Thursday.

“This is a historic day for the health of our people,” she said.

The government announced the rising age alongside other measures to make smoking unaffordable and inaccessible, to try to reach its goal of making the country entirely smoke-free within the next four years.

Other measures include reducing the legal amount of nicotine in tobacco products to very low levels, cutting down the shops where cigarettes could legally be sold, and increasing funding to addiction services. The new laws will not restrict vape sales.

“We want to make sure young people never start smoking so we will make it an offence to sell or supply smoked tobacco products to new cohorts of youth. People aged 14 when the law comes into effect will never be able to legally purchase tobacco,” Verrall said.

"How's this for an archaeological find?

A pre-Incan mummy found in Peru and thought to be between 800 and 1,200 years old has gone on display at the San Marcos University in Lima.

Archaeologists reported finding the pre-Inca Mummy of Cajamarquilla in an underground tomb in November.

The remains, which were discovered with ropes around its hands, were found alongside offerings including ceramics, vegetable remains and stone tools.

It is the latest of many stunning archaeological discoveries in Peru. The South American country, which is home to the iconic Machu Picchu, has hundreds of sites from cultures that developed before and after the Inca Empire, which dominated the southern part of South America 500 years ago.

"When a pitch invader held up play during Chelsea’s Champions League clash with Juventus, this is how striker Sam Kerr responded.

The Australia captain dropped her shoulder and ran into the man, knocking him to the ground. 

The boos that had greeted the invader instantly turned to cheers for Kerr, before the man took to his feet and made his way from the pitch with stewards in pursuit, to applause from the stands. 

Kerr’s take down earned her a yellow card – and plenty of praise on social media. Sports reporter, Vince Rugari, joked: ‘It was hard to think of a way Sam Kerr could finish this week that would endear her to Australian fans even more, beyond what she’s achieved on the field. This was the only way.’

"A historic vote granting equal marriage rights to same-sex couples in Chile has been heralded by activists as a triumph and a blow to the conservative agenda of presidential candidate José Antonio Kast.

“Marriage equality is a ray of sunshine, a bit of hope,” said Isabel Amor, director of the gay rights organization Iguales, who said that the country’s LGBTQ+ community is in a “very fragile emotional state” with the threat of a Kast presidency. “We have to ask what we will lose if he gets the presidency.”

Kast won a plurality of votes in November’s first-round vote – taking 28% of the vote and beating the progressive former student leader Gabriel Boric by two percentage points – an outcome that sent a wave of fear through the country’s LGBTQ+ community. A tight runoff between Kast and Boric is scheduled for 19 December.

While Boric advocates greater rights for minorities, Kast’s agenda is founded upon traditionalist politics formed by devout Catholic values.

Kast, who denies he is homophobic, has said that “society works best with heterosexual couples”; his presidential program offers subsidies to married heterosexual families with children, deliberately excluding same-sex couples.

During his 16 years as a deputy, he resisted progressive legislation, voting against an anti-discrimination law in 2012 and the Civil Union agreement in 2015 – both of which were eventually passed. He fiercely opposed the gender identity bill, which was passed in 2018 to give legal protections to trans people.

The equal marriage bill, expected to be signed into law before March, will allow same-sex couples parental rights, which was not possible under the Civil Union act. It was first submitted by Michelle Bachelet’s government in 2017 but was neglected by lawmakers until given urgent status by president Sebastian Piñera in June.

Piñera previously opposed the law but said “life” and “meeting people” had led him to change his mind.

Chile is the sixth nation in South America to legalize same-sex marriage, joining Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador.

"This heartbreaking image shows a young Rohingya refugee in 2017 crying as he climbs on a truck distributing aid near the Balukali refugee camp in Cox's Bazar.

He was among the more than half a million Rohingya refugees forced into Bangladesh, fleeing an offensive by Myanmar's military that the UN called 'a textbook example of ethnic cleansing'.

Now, Facebook is being accused of facilitating the genocide of Rohingya, the Muslim minority in Myanmar, through negligence - and facing compensation claims worth more than £150bn. The social media network’s algorithms amplified hate speech and the platform failed to take down inflammatory posts, according to legal action launched in the US and the UK.

The American complaint cites Facebook posts that appeared in a Reuters report, with one in 2013 stating: “We must fight them the way Hitler did the Jews, damn Kalars [a derogatory term for Rohingya people].” Another post in 2018, showing a photograph of a boatload of Rohingya refugees, says: “Pour fuel and set fire so that they can meet Allah faster.”

Facebook admitted three years ago that it had not done enough to prevent the incitement of violence and hate speech against the Rohingya.

But one of the law firms says: “Despite Facebook’s recognition of its culpability ... there has not been a single penny of compensation, nor any other form of reparations or support, offered to any survivor.”

The number of Rohingya killed in 2017, during the Myanmar military’s “clearance operations”, is likely to be more than 10,000, according to the charity Médicins sans Frontières.

About 1 million Rohingyas live in Cox’s Bazar refugee camp, in Bangladesh, where refugees say they are dealing with the trauma of witnessing mass killings, rape and the torching of villages, as they remain trapped in squalid camps.

Facebook’s owner, Meta, said: ""We’re appalled by the crimes ... We’ve built a dedicated team of Burmese speakers, banned the Tatmadaw [Myanmar's state military], disrupted networks manipulating public debate and taken action on harmful misinformation to help keep people safe ...""

"Rapper Travis Scott has denied responsibility for deaths at the Astroworld festival in Houston, where 10 people died last month when the crowd surged toward the stage.

The incident was among the deadliest live music crowd events in recent US history.

More than 140 lawsuits have been filed so far, including a mass litigation suit brought by more than 1,500 concertgoers. Most of the cases allege the defendants, including Scott, were negligent and stood to gain from continuing the concert despite the crowd control issues.

Scott denies the allegations.

In court documents responding to six lawsuits obtained earlier this week by CNN, attorneys for Scott asked for the cases to be dismissed and barred from being brought again. “Defendants generally deny the allegations set forth,” they said.

Families of victims blasted the rapper’s legal filings as “shameful”.

Houston attorney James Lassiter told CNN that Scott “continues using social media to present a public image of someone who is grieved by the catastrophic loss of life that his actions caused” while “quietly paying celebrity lawyers to argue his victims deserve nothing more than symbolic help with funeral costs”.

Soon after the tragedy, Scott released a video statement to say he was “honestly just devastated” by the tragedy.

Scott has offered to pay for the funerals of victims of the crowd control disaster. However, at least one family, that of the youngest victim Ezra Blount, nine, declined the offer.

Another Houston attorney, Brent Coons, is demanding Scott pay $10bn to settle litigation from the disaster. The attorney represents 1,547 concertgoers, which the law firm said is the largest suit to date. Lawyers have asked the court to combine to cases to make litigation speedier.

“What happened at Astroworld was an unconscionable tragedy and it is important that justice is served for all those impacted,” said Coons.",2021-12-08 19:00:16
"""They are laughing at us all.""

The UK government is facing a furious backlash after senior No 10 officials were filmed joking about a lockdown Christmas party that Downing Street insists did not take place.

Prime minister Boris Johnson, along with a number of Conservative ministers and MPs, are facing accusations of lying after repeatedly denying that the event, reportedly held for staff at No 10 in December last year, broke Covid rules or took place at all.

In the leaked video of a mock televised press briefing, an adviser to Johnson is seen joking with Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then press secretary, about “a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night”.

The footage, obtained by ITV, was shot on 22 December 2020. The Friday before was 18 December, the date on which multiple sources have said there was a staff party inside Downing Street, which would have contravened strict Covid regulations in place at the time.

Testimony from many sources says No 10 staff held a party that day, with a Secret Santa, refreshments and games.

The emergence of this video has been called a “bullet to the chest” of families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic. Dr Saleyha Ahsan, from the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, told BBC Breakfast the saga was “an example of how the government have run this from the start: one rule for them and the rest of us have to adhere to different rules.”

Ahsan, who said she had been working in north Wales at the time of the mock press conference, said: “Numerous people around the country couldn’t spend those precious last few days, hours, minutes with loved ones. It was heartbreaking. In 14 years in the NHS I’ve never seen anything like it.""

The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, wrote on Twitter: ""... This is absolutely sickening. They are laughing at us all. It's one rule for them and another for the rest of us.""

Asked about the footage, Downing Street insisted it had not changed its view, saying: “There was no Christmas party. Covid rules have been followed at all times.”

"""Our culture is disappearing"".

Climate breakdown is crushing the way people have previously lived for hundreds of years.

As part of our push to hear more from those on the frontlines, we have been profiling individuals whose lives have been changed beyond recognition. From Taymyr in Russia, this is Gennadiy Shukin's story:

I was born in 1962 in a family of deer herders in Taymyr, on a peninsula in the very far north of Russia.

I am part of the Dolgan community: we are an Indigenous Russian group and there are around 6,000 left of us living in the tundra.

Growing up, the Soviet Union tried to deny us our traditional way of life, but since then climate change has become the biggest challenge to our survival.

Our community lives by hunting, fishing and herding deer. Scientists say that Taymyr has the most rapid temperature increase in Russia, and we can really feel it.

Because of the warmer winters, we have seen that deer are giving birth earlier in the year. Many are born too weak and don’t survive the long journeys they have to make. This means there is much less deer for us to hunt and it hurts the whole ecosystem.

Rivers and lakes that we use for fishing have also started to dry out. Others are too polluted after all the big oil and gas plants have sprung up over the years in our lands. Some days we don’t catch any fish at all.

For generations, we have sold the food we caught to local towns and cities to buy basic products like sugar and wheat. Without animals, we cannot survive.

Big craters are also forming because the Arctic permafrost is starting to melt under our feet. This means the routes that we have used for decades to travel, hunt and fish have to be adjusted as whole roads have sunk. It is also dangerous as you never know where the next crater will form.

The youth sees that climate change makes our traditional way of life impossible and they are forced to move to the bigger cities to find jobs, which are often low-paid. Our culture is disappearing.

"A damning new light has been shed on the hour-by-hour decisions made by the UK Foreign Office in the days after the Taliban takeover.

Former desk officer, Raphael Marshall, has blown the whistle on what he says was internal bureaucratic chaos, ministerial intervention, lack of planning and a short-hours culture following the fall of Kabul led to “people being left to die at the hands of the Taliban”.

He has now quit the department and, in testimony to the foreign affairs select committee published on Tuesday, has revealed the extent of what he witnessed.

Then foreign minister Dominic Raab, who was on holiday when Kabul fell, has been accused of misunderstanding the haphazard process and desperate position at Kabul airport by delaying several emergency evacuation referrals.

Raab has rebuffed a number of the charges, saying he would make no apology for requesting officials redo urgent appeals for help from Afghans in a different spreadsheet format. But it is likely the Marshall’s evidence and the launch of the still unpublished internal inquiry contributed to the decision to move Raab to a new cabinet role.

Swipe through to see some of the key criticisms made by Marshall - and how the government has responded.

"How would you react to getting fired like this?

The chief executive of a US mortgage company has drawn criticism after he reportedly fired 900 employees on a Zoom call.

“I come to you with not great news,” Vishal Garg, CEO of Better.com, was heard saying at the beginning of the video call made on Wednesday last week. Footage of the call was widely circulated on social media.

“If you’re on this call, you are part of the unlucky group being laid off. Your employment here is terminated effective immediately,” Garg continued, citing changes in the market, “efficiency” and “productivity” as the reasons behind the mass termination.

“The market has changed … we have to move with it in order to survive,” the 43-year-old offered as explanation. “Ultimately it was my decision and I wanted you to hear it from me.”

He then reportedly said the employees could expect an email from HR with details of severance and benefits.

Garg, a self-described “serial entrepreneur”, said the decision was “really, really challenging” and noted it was the second time in his career he had made such job cuts.

One now-former employee described the call as “three minutes tops,” in an interview with The Daily Beast.

“They dumped us like trash. We were there since the beginning and worked hard for the company and for our roles,” another said.

The mortgage lender startup reportedly received a $750m (£564m) cash infusion from investors last week and was recently valued at around $7bn, according to Forbes.

Kevin Ryan, Better.com’s chief financial officer, was quoted as saying the company had laid off 9% of its employees after the call.

"After a bumper wet season, huge flocks of budgerigars are on the move in the desert. A massive murmuration – the phenomenon of thousands of birds flocking together – has swarmed Australia's Northern Territory.

Photographer Steve Pearce has captured the natural phenomenon, saying ""The photos are always only pointing in one direction. There could have been 100,000 of them.""

After a tough couple of years due to drought and bushfires, some inland Australian bird species are now thriving after a buoyant wet season.

Pearce said this was the biggest murmuration he had ever seen.

“You hear one budgie, that first fella comes in, he flies past, then another one, then it’s like over a short time, maybe five minutes, they all just turn up and start arriving en masse ... There’s a critical mass that sweeps in.

""It’s spectacular.”

“The visual stuff it’s mesmerising, you can’t look away, it’s spectacular. It is a dynamic expression of nature,” he added.

A show this big is rare. The nomadic creatures need to drink water daily and as the smaller watering holes dry up they are forced to congregate together. They go where the rain goes – so it never lasts long.

"“This piece is considered a God, not just a sculpture.”

For more than 20 years, those who lived in and around the village of Lokhari in Uttar Pradesh, India, have prayed for the return of an important statue of a goddess that was stolen from a local temple.

Now, the 8th-century goat-headed deity has been discovered thousands of miles away – in a garden in the UK, and will formally be given back to the High Commission of India in London.

It is a case that shames Sotheby’s, which offered the statue for sale in 1988, a few years before the auctioneer was to face serious allegations of having encouraged looting of ancient Indian religious sites.

In 1997, the statue was among looted antiquities featured in the former Observer journalist Peter Watson’s damning book, titled Sotheby’s: Inside Story. He and investigators from the Channel 4 Dispatches programme also secretly filmed Indian dealers claiming that they had supplied an entire container-load of objects, some of which were sold at Sotheby’s in London. It led to the auction house ending regular antiquities sales in London and tightening up procedures to ensure it would not handle an item if there was a suspicion it might have been looted abroad.

This recovery has been made possible by Christopher Marinello, a leading expert in recovering stolen, looted and missing art. “This piece is considered a god, not just a sculpture,” he said. “Looted objects are not simply financial assets for collectors and auction houses to profit from.”

He added: “My goal is to call out Sotheby’s for selling loot but more importantly to highlight the countless looted objects in English gardens and collections related to colonial history.""

Sotheby’s said: “This episode relates to something that allegedly occurred almost quarter of a century ago. Sotheby’s adheres to the highest standards in the industry, supported by a world-class compliance team, who work closely with outside authorities to ensure that we operate to the highest level of business integrity.”

"How can you manipulate the weather?

Chinese weather authorities successfully controlled the weather ahead of a major political celebration earlier this year, according to a Beijing university study.

On 1 July the Chinese Communist party marked its centenary with major celebrations including tens of thousands of people at a ceremony in Tiananmen Square, and a research paper from Tsinghua University has said an extensive cloud-seeding operation in the hours prior ensured clear skies and low air pollution.

Cloud-seeding is a weather modification technique, which sees the adding of chemicals like small particles of silver iodide, to clouds, causing water droplets to cluster around them and increasing the chance of precipitation.

The researchers said in this instance the resulting artificial rain reduced the level of PM2.5 air pollutants by more than two-thirds, and shifted the air quality index reading, based on World Health Organization standards, from “moderate” to “good”.

The Chinese government has been an enthusiastic proponent of cloud-seeding technology, spending billions of dollars on efforts to manipulate the weather to protect agricultural regions or improve significant events including the 2008 Olympics.

Last year Beijing announced plans to expand its experimental weather modification program to an area 1.5 times the size of India covered by artificial rain or snow.

While there is a growing body of scientific evidence around the success of cloud-seeding, there is also a debate about whether manipulating the weather in one area could disrupt weather systems elsewhere.

"Bol Kek, 45, lives in Paguir in South Sudan and in this image she’s collecting water lily bulbs to ground down and eat.

Where she lives there’s very little food and no land to cultivate after three years of floods. Fields are submerged in flood water and higher ground is overcrowded, in what is quickly becoming a humanitarian crisis.

Many of those who lost this year’s harvest also lost their livestock to diseases caused by the animals grazing on flooded fields. Without the milk and meat traditionally provided by cattle to fill the gaps many people are looking for wild food.

South Sudan is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate breakdown, according to the Global Climate Index.

An estimated 1.7 million people are displaced within South Sudan. Meanwhile the UN says the country as a whole has 8 million people in need. An estimated 2.5 million people are facing severe food insecurity and more than 100,000 are considered close to famine.

"Vegan alternatives to leather could save more than just animals. The scientists behind fashion’s new latest must-have – the “mushroom leather” handbag – believe that mycelium, a material grown from fungi which can be engineered to look and feel like calfskin or sheepskin, could help save the planet.

Speaking to the Guardian before a talk at the Business of Fashion Voices conference in Oxfordshire, Dr Matt Scullin, CEO of biomaterials company MycoWorks, forecast that mushroom leather could be a sustainability gamechanger, “unlocking a future of design which begins with the material, not with the object”.

Fine Mycelium, a patented material which can be grown from fungi in trays in a matter of weeks, replicates the appearance and feel of leather while outperforming it in strength and durability. The material recently made its high fashion debut as an exclusive Hermès handbag.

“It can give the same emotional response as an animal leather. It has that hand-feel of rarity,” says Scullin. On a planet of finite natural resources, Scullin believes both the technology and the mindset of carbon-neutral, grown-to-order mushroom leather could be “revolutionary” – and have implications for innovation in manufacture beyond fashion.

"From @guardian_us: why is meaningful action to avert the climate crisis proving so difficult? It is, at least in part, because of ads.

The fossil fuel industry has perpetrated a multi-decade, multibillion dollar disinformation, propaganda and lobbying campaign to delay climate action by confusing the public and policymakers about the climate crisis and its solutions.

They’d now like us to forget many of them. But seeing the adverts in their shameless glory is a crucial part of understanding how we got here, and the half-truths, distortions and outright lies we're still being fed.

In 1962 Humble Oil (now ExxonMobil), released perhaps one of the most outrageous adverts ever made. “Each day,"" it boasted, ""Humble supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!”

It was an early example of Big Oil's desperate push against climate science, which only grew louder and more cynical in the following decades, before pivoting towards greenwashing and ""personal responsibility"" narratives in the 2000s - and companies have been distorting reality in the 2020s too.

"Ilhan Omar played a harrowing death threat recently left on her voicemail, as she implored House Republican leaders to do more to tamp down “anti-Muslim hatred” in their ranks and “hold those who perpetuate it accountable”.

The Democratic Minnesota representative, one of only a handful of Muslim members of Congress, has been the subject of repeated attacks by conservative pundits and some Republicans in Congress, which she says have led to an increase in the number of death threats she receives.

Recently a video of the first-term Colorado representative Lauren Boebert calling @ilhanmn a member of the “jihad squad” and likening her to a bomb-carrying terrorist went viral.

“When a sitting member of Congress calls a colleague a member of the ‘jihad squad’ and falsifies a story to suggest I will blow up the Capitol, it is not just an attack on me but on millions of American Muslims across the country,” Omar said during a news conference on Tuesday. “We cannot pretend this hate speech from leading politicians doesn’t have real consequences.”

She then played the voicemail, laden with profanity, racial epithets and a threat to “take you off the face of this fucking Earth”, which she said was among hundreds of such messages she has reported since joining Congress. Omar said the voicemail was left for her after @repboebert released another video on Monday criticising her.

Boebert’s remarks were the latest example of a Republican lawmaker making a personal attack against another member of Congress, an unsettling trend that has gone largely unchecked by House Republican leaders.

"Red paint sprayed across the streets and dummies sprawled on the pavements: this image shows one of the latest protests against Poland's near-total ban on abortions.

Women’s rights activists in Warsaw used the figures to symbolise those suffering under the restrictive laws with the paint representing their blood.

The protest was part of a demonstration against new government plans to register every pregnancy in a national database and a proposal to further restrict abortion.

Activists fear the database will allow Poland's right-wing authorities to track whether pregnancies end in a birth and become a tool for possible prosecutions.

Abortion has always been strictly controlled in Poland, but laws were tightened further this year sparking an outcry and mass protests.

Currently, abortions are only allowed in cases of rape or incest or if the woman's life is in danger. Though activists say many doctors now wait for a foetus with no chance of survival to die in the womb rather than perform an abortion because they fear being sent to jail.

Poland's health minister denied that there was a pregnancy register, saying that the government was just turning all the files digital from paper.

But parliament is scheduled to debate a proposal for a complete ban on abortion, including in cases of rape and danger to a woman’s health. If this becomes law, activists who assist women in having abortions risk facing years of imprisonment for murder - where the penalty could range from five years to a life sentence.

Amnesty International has called on Polish lawmakers to reject the ""sinister bill"" and “the latest in a wave of cruel and discriminatory attacks on women’s human rights.”

"""This is NOT the answer"".

An increasing number of countries are banning travel to and from countries in Africa due to the Omicron Covid variant.

Despite the variant being found in Europe before South African detected and flagged it to the world, it is the African nations that have been closed off from countries like Canada, UK, US, Australia, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia, to name a few.

This has sparked a conversation online about how these bans are could be fuelled by racism, and how this situation was inevitable due to vaccine inequality across the world.

Here's an excerpt:

""Toughening up restrictions in the west in response to Omicron is a classic case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, because for months the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been warning rich developed countries that an end to the pandemic requires poor people as well as rich to be vaccinated.""

"Donald Trump tested positive for Covid-19 three days before his first debate against Joe Biden, the former president’s fourth and last chief of staff has revealed in a new book. A copy was obtained by the Guardian.

Mark Meadows also writes that though he knew each candidate was required “to test negative for the virus within seventy two hours of the start time … Nothing was going to stop [Trump] from going out there.”

Trump, Meadows says in the book, returned a negative result from a different test shortly after the positive.

Nonetheless, the stunning revelation of an unreported positive test follows a year of speculation about whether Trump, then 74 years old, had the potentially deadly virus when he faced Biden, 77, in Cleveland on 29 September – and what danger that might have presented.

Despite the president looking “a little tired” and suspecting a “slight cold”, Meadows says he was “content” that Trump travelled that evening to a rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania.
But as Marine One lifted off, Meadows writes, the White House doctor called.

“Stop the president from leaving,” Meadows says Sean Conley told him. “He just tested positive for Covid.”

It wasn’t possible to stop Trump but when he called from Air Force One, his chief of staff gave him the news.

“Mr President,” Meadows said, “I’ve got some bad news. You’ve tested positive for Covid-19.”
Trump’s reply, the devout Christian writes, “rhyme[d] with ‘Oh spit, you’ve gotta be trucking lidding me’”.

"Ten days ago, people stood on a beach on the south coast of England and tried to prevent a lifeboat crew from going into the sea to rescue a group of refugees in a flimsy dinghy.

According to witnesses, who captured the footage above, they were shouting at crews from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (@rnli) charity: “Don’t bring any more of those, we’re full up, that’s why we stopped our donations.”

Conversely, a group from the same town calling itself Hastings Supports Refugees (@hsrefugees) has set up what is thought to be the first emergency response team run by volunteers to welcome the bedraggled, traumatised newcomers and provide them with hot food and drinks, dry clothes and a warm welcome as soon as they come ashore.

The two approaches underline tensions at the heart of the East Sussex coastal town affected by the rise in small boat arrivals which culminated in 27 people drowning as they attempted to cross the Channel last week.

"Hundreds of macaques, also known as long-tailed monkeys, climbed on people - and stacks of fruit - in Lopburi in central Thailand during its annual Monkey Festival.

The feast, which featured two tonnes fruits and vegetables and cost over 100,000 baht ($3,000), is an annual tradition for locals to thank the monkeys for doing their part in drawing in tourists to the town, which is sometimes known as ""Monkey Province.""

""Today's special is durian, which is expensive. Lopburi monkeys like expensive things,"" said Yongyuth Kitwatananusont who has previously organised over 30 monkey festivals.

"From Adidas to Zara: new research into the fashion industry’s complex global supply chains shows that a number of large fashion brands are at risk of contributing to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, based on their connections to tanneries and other companies involved in the production of leather and leather goods.

The report, released by Stand.earth on Monday, analysed nearly 500,000 rows of customs data and found that brands such as Coach, LVMH, Prada, H&M, Zara, Adidas, Nike, New Balance, Teva, UGG and Fendi have multiple connections to an industry that props up Amazon deforestation.

Angeline Robertson, an investigative researcher who worked on the study, told us she hopes the fashion industry will take cues from their analysis and “work in their own self-interest”. Adding: “In this time of climate emergency, if the fashion industry wants to be relevant, this is the opportunity.""

This analysis does not prove a direct link between each fashion brand and Amazon deforestation; instead, researchers found connections that increase the probability of any individual garment coming from cattle ranching in the Amazon, an industry described as the No 1 culprit of deforestation in the area.

"Nearly 400 years after the first English ships arrived in Barbados, the sun has set on the British monarchy’s long reign over the Caribbean island.

As the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, the Royal Standard flag representing the Queen was lowered over a crowded Heroes Square in Bridgetown - marking the birth of the world’s newest republic.

Guests applauded as Dame Sandra Mason was sworn in as the country's first ever president. “Republic Barbados has set sail on her maiden voyage,” Mason said in her inauguration speech, recognising the “complex, fractured and turbulent world” it would need to navigate.

Announcing the decision to cut ties with the monarchy in 2020, prime minister Mia Mottley, who led the ceremony last night, said the time had come for Barbados to “fully leave our colonial past behind”. During the ceremony she also declared musician Rihanna a national hero.

When he returned a decade later in the 70s as a 22-year-old photography student @godlis decided to retrace his steps and document a now-lost world of art deco hotels and sunbathing retirees.

While walking the streets all day, he discovered a rich Jewish retiree enclave on the expansive beaches facing the Atlantic ocean. Godlis says he ended up shooting about 60 rolls of film.

""All these memories of Florida came flowing back to me. As I tripped the shutter over and over, taking pictures on those beaches I had walked upon as a little kid, everything clicked.""

""These retirees, all dressed up in their best beach outfits, would spend their days on loungers and lawn chairs, playing cards amid the sunshine and palm trees offering themselves as perfect subjects.""

""For them – Jewish eastern European immigrants who had lived out their working life on the street of New York – retiring to sunshine, warm weather, beaches and palm trees was a slice of heaven. For me it was like a Jewish Disneyland. Goodbye snow, hello coconuts.""

"Barbados is set to become the first nation to remove Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state in nearly three decades.

From midnight tonight, the Caribbean nation will officially declare itself a republic, a move that was flagged last year in the thick of activism inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, and was recommended over 20 years ago by a government commission.

It is a rejection of the British monarchy, part of a wider campaign that includes strengthening ties with the African nations from which most Barbadians claim heritage and renewing demands for the UK government to make reparations for its historical crimes.

In an official ceremony, attended by Prince Charles, Barbados the current governor-general Dame Sandra Mason, pictured above, will be sworn in to serve a four-year term as president.

The 17th century 'sugar revolution' which made England extraordinarily rich was built on the backs of enslaved Africans taken to work on plantations in Barbados and other Caribbean islands. “It was in Barbados that the slavery plantation production model was invented – right here,” says David Comissiong, the country’s ambassador to Caricom, a Caribbean regional integration body.

Reclassified under British law as property, the men, women and children who worked the cane fields of Barbados were subject to unimaginable brutality. The first systematic study of the health of those buried at the Newton Slave Burial Ground found the average life expectancy of those examined was 18 years old, with the lives of women thought to be especially appalling.

“Barbados was a hellhole,” Comissiong says. “For black people, Barbados was a brutal, hellish society.”

Alexander Downes, 32, started the petition which resulted in the removal of the statues of British slavery defender Horatio Nelson from the country's capital last year.

Asked what the crown means to him, Downes is clear. “It signifies a time when people who looked like me … were almost considered just a part in the process of generating wealth,” he says. “Humanity was not considered. Civil rights were not considered.”

"For most of her childhood, Antonella Bordon’s silky hair ran all the way down her back to her calves.

But when her school was forced to stay shut through the coronavirus pandemic - leaving her stuck inside her home near Buenos Aires - she dreamed of the day she would again join her friends in the classroom.

The 12-year-old made a promise to herself: when that day finally came, she would cut her nearly floor‑length locks right off.

@irinawerning began photographing Antonella's long hair three years ago and continued documenting her after Covid reached Argentina.

During this time, Werning's series, La Promesa (the Promise), became not just about the hair itself, they told the story of Antonella's experience: that of a young girl constrained by one of the longest government-enforced lockdowns in the world and isolated from her friends.

Werning said; “I showed her doing Zoom classes. I shot her in moments where she was very anxious for her future, I photographed her helping at the shop. I photographed her in very limited situations because she was not seeing her friends or doing anything; but her hair was the protagonist of everything.”

Schools were forced to close across the world when the Covid-19 crisis hit, but children in Latin America are said to have lost about three months’ more class time than their contemporaries elsewhere, and it is estimated more than three million may never return to school.

In the end, Antonella missed 260 days of school. She was fortunate in the sense that she was living in a household where education was a priority – her mother always made her phone available so she could study. During lockdown, both her parents lost their job and instead have now opened a shop in their small family home.

When Antonella's school fully reopened in September, she followed through with her pledge and cut her hair. It's now waiting to be donated to be made into a wig for cancer patients.

“The truth is,” says Bordon, “I wasn’t sad when I cut it – I was happy. I’ve become a different person.”

"Virgil Abloh, the much-loved, trailblazing founder of Off-White and acclaimed artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear has passed away at the age of 41 after a two-year battle with a rare form of cancer, it was announced this evening. 

A message shared on his Instagram account said: “We are devastated to announce the passing of our beloved Virgil Abloh. He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture.

“Through it all, his work ethic, infinite curiosity, and optimism never wavered. Virgil was driven by his dedication to his craft and to his mission to open doors for others and create pathways for greater equality in art and design. He often said, ‘Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself,’ believing deeply in the power of art to inspire future generations.”

Abloh redefined the idea of the modern fashion designer, adding DJ, artist and furniture designer to his creative arsenal. After training as an architect, he started designing clothes in 2012 - and went on to become the first Black designer at Vuitton and one of the most visible Black designers in fashion. 

Abloh was also a hugely visible figure in rap, designing the album covers for Kanye West, Jay-Z, Pop Smoke, Westside Gunn, Octavian and Lil Uzi Vert.

Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH that owns Louis Vuitton paid tribute to the designer. “We are all shocked by this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer and a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom.”

He is survived by his wife Shannon and his children Lowe and Grey.

"One of the world’s most loyally monogamous creatures, Albatrosses, are “divorcing” more often – and researchers say global heating may be to blame.

Typically after choosing a partner, only 1-3% albatross would separate in search of greener romantic pastures, but a new study has found warmer waters mean the birds are travelling further for food and that has caused the separation rate to rise up to 8%. For seabirds, warmer waters mean less fish, less food and a harsher environment. Fewer chicks survive. The birds’ stress hormones increase. They are forced farther afield to hunt.

Albatross usually live for around 50-60 years. They have a long, awkward teen phase as they learn how to seduce a mate through dance, and take years-long trips away from home as they mature. They usually to mate for life, and loudly celebrate when greeting a partner after a long absence.

But now, they increasingly share another rite of passage that may sound familiar to young humans: under stress from the climate crisis, working longer hours to eat, and faced with the logistical difficulties of a traveling partner, some are struggling to maintain relationships.

The Royal Society study, which looked at a wild population of 15,500 breeding pairs in the Falkland Islands over 15 years, comes as many international albatross populations are in trouble.

Their numbers are plummeting by 5-10% every year, and have been dropping since around 2005, says Dr Graeme Elliot, principal science adviser at New Zealand’s department of conservation, who has been studying albatrosses for three decades. He says this is as a result of less prey, warming seas, and increasing encounters with tuna line-fishing boats, which accidentally catch and kill the birds.

Elliot now hopes that some of the sympathies people have for albatrosses could motivate changes in behaviour, to address the environmental threats the birds are facing – particularly climate change, and tuna fishing. “We kind of need an international campaign to save these birds. If we don’t turn it around, they’ll go extinct.”

For many observers, the high-profile case of the three white men convicted of murdering Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was out jogging, revealed the racist ways the American legal system has been designed to treat Black people differently.

Arbery’s father, Marcus Arbery, thanked his son’s mother, and the activists and lawyers who helped draw attention to his son’s case. “God put us all together to make this happen,” he said. “We conquered that lynch mob. We got that lynch mob ...""

From the Oval Office, Joe Biden reflected on Arbery’s killing as a “devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country” but saw the trial’s outcome as a beacon of hope.

Outside court, civil rights leader the Rev Al Sharpton told the cheering crowd: “Brunswick, Georgia, will go down in history as the place where criminal justice took a different turn.

"Like hundreds of thousands of other Afghan girls and young women, university student Hawa has not been allowed to return to her studies since the Taliban seized power earlier this year. 

Instead she has been stuck at home, poring over books by a window, her dreams on hold.

Along with many of her peers, Hawa is feeling a mixture of sadness, frustration and anger that her aspirations to study and work are being thwarted.

The hardline Islamist movement is now allowing all boys and younger girls back to class, but are not letting girls attend secondary school. Most public universities are not functioning at all, or only partially.

The current edict makes Afghanistan the only country on earth to bar half its population from getting a secondary education - and the decision worryingly echoes of the tactics used by the Taliban when they last ruled from 1996-2001.

"The three white men who chased and killed Ahmaud Arbery have been found guilty of murder, following his 2020 shooting death in south Georgia, which led to a wave of racial justice protest and a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in the US.

Travis McMicheal, his father Greg McMichael and their neighbour William “Roddie” Bryan were each convicted for murdering Arbery, who was unarmed, after pursuing him in February last year and claiming, without evidence, he had been involved in a spate of burglaries in their neighborhood.

The verdict was announced after two weeks of testimony and evidence in the closely watched trial. 

Travis McMichael was the only one of the three men to take the stand during trial, and had argued he shot Arbery with his shotgun in self-defense. The defendants said they had tried to enact a citizen’s arrest on Arbery, an argument disputed by the prosecution, who said they had no probable cause to detain Arbery, a frequent jogger in the neighborhood.

Although the case became an emblem of racial injustice and bias in the US criminal justice system to many, prosecutors ultimately left the issue of racism outside the case. 

In closing arguments, lead prosecutor Linda Dunikoski made just a passing reference to the allegations of racial bias, stating: “they [the defendants] made their decision to attack Ahmaud Arbery in their driveways, because he was a Black man running down the street.”

But allegations of racism and intentional bias surrounded the court case throughout.

"Aid workers have issued a stark warning about the state of migrant crossings in the Mediterranean with more than 75 people feared dead off the coast of Libya.

Their boat capsized in stormy seas while attempting to reach Europe in one of the deadliest shipwrecks this year, according to the UN.

Fifteen survivors were rescued by local fishers and brought to the port of Zuwara in north-western Libya. They said there were about 92 people onboard the vessel when the incident took place on 17 November. Most of those who died came from sub-Saharan Africa.

According to aid workers, people smugglers are sending hundreds of people to sea this autumn, careless of stormy weather. Many of the journeys ended in tragedy.

Last week, 10 people were found dead in the lower deck of a severely overcrowded wooden boat off the coast of Libya, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) reported.

Abdoulaye, one of the last survivors to leave the boat, barely had the time to understand what had happened to his fellow travellers before the MSF rescuers took his arm and helped him into the rescue lifeboat.

“Let me see their bodies,” he told the team. “These are my brothers. We come from the same place, we went through Libya together. I need to tell their families they are dead. Please let me see them.”

An estimated 1,300 people have died or gone missing while attempting to cross the central Mediterranean so far this year. In April, more than 120 died in a single incident. In comparison, between January to November last year, at least 575 people were thought to have died in the central Mediterranean, according to the UN migration agency (IOM).

The volunteer-run Mediterranean rescue hotline Alarm Phone said the most recent shipwreck was a “consequence of a lethal European migration policy that does everything to prevent people from reaching Europe and that does nothing to prevent ongoing mass drowning along its borders”.

It added: “It is just a matter of time until we hear about the next shipwreck, and the one after that. We need radical political change, otherwise the Mediterranean will remain a liquid graveyard.’’

"""If there is no treasure, it means there is no history; if there is no history, there is no nation.""

Do you agree with Ethiopia's ambassador to the UK?

Teferi Meles said this when - after a century and a half hidden in private collections - 13 Ethiopian artefacts stolen by British forces were finally returned home following months of negotiations.

The collection includes a ceremonial crown, a shield, a handwritten prayer book, crosses, a necklace, and a set of silver-embossed horn drinking cups.

The treasures were formally handed over two months ago at a ceremony in London, but were unwrapped at Ethiopia's national museum on Saturday.

These particular artefacts were taken in 1868, following the battle of Maqdala between the British and Ethiopian empires. Some of the objects had been offered in an auction by a private seller in the UK this June.

In 1868, around 13,000 British soldiers were sent into the Ethiopian (formerly Abyssinian) mountains to capture the mountain capital of Maqdala. Some 700 Abyssinians died and more than a thousand were injured in the siege. When Emperor Tewodros II saw he had lost, he shot himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria. The fortress was looted and razed to the ground. It is said to have taken 15 elephants and 200 mules to remove the loot.

Ethiopia said it was the largest such repatriation of artefacts to the country with Melesse saying it is of ""huge significance"".

But this is just the start. The Ethiopian government is still fighting for Britain to return the remains of Prince Alemayehu, as well as sacred wooden and stone tabots or tablets, which represent the Ark of the Covenant. The tabots are housed in the British Museum in London, which is notorious for housing artefacts stolen during the colonial era.

Calls have long been mounting across the African continent for Western countries to return the thousands of artefacts stolen during European colonial rule. Share your thoughts in the comments section.

"Sea turtles on the sandy shores of western Senegal have made a rapid comeback because of quieter beaches during the coronavirus pandemic.

With less activity and less light from the nearby hotels, more turtles have come to lay their eggs on the beach in the villages like Guéréo. 

Fifteen turtles nested on Guéréo's beach last season, up from just two the previous year. 

Turtle nests are appearing in greater numbers than ever before along West Africa's shores. 

Increased fishing, tourism and construction have deterred Senegal's three species of turtle, all of which appear on International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List.

And while they have appeared in greater numbers than ever before due to the Covid pandemic, all species of turtles in Senegal and in the world remain threatened and endangered. 

Charlotte Thomas, a turtle researcher at the Oceanium marine conservation organisation in Dakar, says; ""turtles play the role of ocean cleaner. They regulate marine algae by eating them, and marine algae is depended upon by lot on other species such as tuna, lobster and shrimp. If these turtles were to disappear, that would create an imbalance in the food chain and threaten the entire ecosystem.""

"They say that grandchildren are life’s greatest joy, and now the first study to examine grandmothers’ brain function has suggested they may be more emotionally connected to their grandkids than to their offspring.

The research, led by Prof James Rilling, an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, recruited 50 women with at least one grandchild aged between three and 12, and used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan their brains as they looked at photos of that child, the child’s parents, and images of an unrelated child and adult.

“What really jumps out is the activation in areas of the brain associated with emotional empathy,” Rilling said. “That suggests that grandmothers are geared toward feeling what their grandchildren are feeling when they interact with them. If their grandchild is smiling, they’re feeling the child’s joy. And if their grandchild is crying, they’re feeling the child’s pain and distress.”

In contrast, when the grandmothers looked at images of their adult child, slightly different brain areas tended to be activated: those associated with cognitive empathy. This could indicate that they were trying to cognitively understand their adult child, rather than experiencing a more direct emotional connection.

Rilling believes this could possibly help to explain the experience many grown-up children have of their parents often seeming more excited to see their grandchildren than them.

“Young children have likely evolved traits to be able to manipulate not just the maternal brain, but the grand-maternal brain. An adult child doesn’t have the same cute factor, so they may not the same emotional response.”

The findings, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, support the idea that there may be a global caregiving system in the brain that is activated in mothers (who have been examined in separate studies), fathers and grandmothers. Rilling now hopes to study grandfathers and other childcare providers to see how they compare.

"This heartbreaking image from 2019 is of Mischa the bear.

The performing circus animal, who died after years of cruelty, has played a key role in helping to change the law in France.

In new animal rights legislation, the country's parliament has voted to end the use of wild animals in live circus shows.

Performances of wild animals such as lions, tigers or bears will be prohibited in two years, and owning them outlawed in seven years, under the wide-ranging law passed on Thursday.

The new regulations, once signed into law by the president, Emmanuel Macron, will also ban live dolphin shows and mink farming.

The legislation has been praised as “a historic step in the animal rights combat”, for a country that lags behind around 20 European nations that have either banned or heavily restricted the use of animals for entertainment.

Public opinion in Europe has moved decisively against animal circuses, once a popular form of family entertainment, following revelations about cruel treatment and campaigning from rights groups.

As well as the measures targeting circuses, the new law will raise the maximum penalty for mistreating animals to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($85,000), and will tighten restrictions on the sale of pets.

Several events in France in recent years have added momentum for the ban. In 2017 a female tiger, named Mevy, was gunned down in Paris in the name of public safety, after escaping from her enclosure at the Cirque Bormann-Moreno.

The death in 2019 of the sickly performing bear Mischa, who had been rescued from animal trainers after reportedly being kept in conditions akin to a medieval jail, has also been credited with swaying public opinion.

"A jury has found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty on all charges after he shot dead two people and injured a third at an anti-racism protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin last year.

Rittenhouse killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, when he shot them with an assault rifle as he roamed the streets of Kenosha with other self-described militia during protests in August 2020, after a white police officer shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back.

The trial was seen as a test case for the US, as it seemed to illustrate the very different attitudes of law enforcement when confronted with armed white militia groups or anti-racism protests such as Black Lives Matter.

Rittenhouse quickly became a cause celebre for some conservatives, who raised money for his legal fees and sought to portray him as someone who stood up to rioters.

The judge in the case, Bruce Schroeder, also became a source of controversy with a bombastic style, outrageous comments during the trial and attitudes some observers said betrayed sympathy with the defense.

Schroeder ruled before the trial that the men Rittenhouse shot could not be called “victims” by prosecutors. Defense attorneys could, however, use such labels as “arsonists” or “looters” if they could justify it.

Prosecutors argued forcefully that Schroeder was establishing a double standard as the case unfolded.",2021-11-19 20:41:32
"Amazon deforestation in Brazil has soar 22% in the past year to a 15-year high, the government’s annual report has shown, undercutting president Jair Bolsonaro’s assurances that the country is curbing illegal logging.

Brazil‘s space research agency, INPE, recorded 13,235sq km (5,110 square miles) of deforestation in the world’s largest rainforest in satellite data from August 2020 to July 2021.

That's nearly 17 times the size of New York City, nine times the size of Delhi and 8.5 times the size of London.

At the UN climate summit in Glasgow this month, Brazil’s government brought forward a pledge to end illegal deforestation by two years to 2028, a target that would require aggressive annual reductions in the destruction.

Though Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, still calls for more mining and commercial farming in protected parts of the rainforest.

The new INPE report showed deforestation rising in each of the last four cycles – a first for the data series since at least 2000. “The government went to Cop26 knowing the deforestation data and hid it,” said Brazilian advocacy group, Climate Observatory.

Brazil, as home to the majority of the world’s largest rainforest, was seen as crucial to that global pact. The Amazon’s trees absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet.

But some scientists warn that if enough of the forest is destroyed, it could cross a tipping point, dry out and turn into savannah. That would release huge amounts of carbon, virtually ensuring the world cannot hit the targets laid out to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis.

"In a huge victory for India’s farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced he will repeal three contentious farm laws that prompted a year of protests and unrest.

The laws, introduced in September 2020, deregulated the sector, allowing farmers to sell produce to buyers beyond the government-regulated wholesale markets that guarantee growers a minimum price. But farmers said the reforms put their livelihoods at risk and gave private corporations control over the pricing of their crops.

Modi introduced the laws in a bid to overhaul the agriculture sector which still employs about 60% of India’s workforce, but is riddled with issues of poverty, debt and inefficiency.

However, they quickly became a major source of contention among India’s millions of farmers, who accused the government of passing the legislation without consultation.

After the government refused to repeal the laws last year, hundreds of thousands of farmers marched to Delhi’s borders to protest against what they called 'the black laws'.

They were met on the way with barricades, teargas and water cannon, and set up protest camps along the main highways into the capital.

The farmers have remained at the Delhi borders ever since, maintaining one of the most sustained challenges to the Modi government, even through the harsh winters, baking summers and the brutal second wave of Covid-19.

The protests turned violent in February when the farmers stormed into the centre of Delhi and briefly took over the historic Red Fort. Unions say more than 600 farmers died during the protests.

Previously the Modi government had said they would not bow down to pressure from the farmers. However, is thought that the decision to rollback the laws is tied to upcoming crucial state elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, where farmers make up a key proportion of the vote bank and farmers’ unions hold significant power and influence.

During the surprise announcement on Friday, Modi said he was repealing the laws because he lamented that the government had been “unable to convince farmers”. The move is one of the most significant concessions made by his government.

"Do you think mask wearing should still be required?

According to a new global study, which is the first of its kind, wearing a mask is the single most effective public health measure at tackling Covid, reducing incidence by 53%.

While vaccines are safe and effective and saving lives around the world, experts say most do not confer 100% protection, most countries have not vaccinated everyone, and it is not yet known if jabs will prevent future transmission of emerging coronavirus variants.

Globally, Covid cases exceeded 250 million this month. The virus is still infecting 50 million people worldwide every 90 days due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, with thousands dying each day.

Now a systematic review and meta analysis of non-pharmaceutical interventions has found for the first time that mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing are all effective measures at curbing cases – with mask wearing the most effective.

Researchers say the results highlight the need to continue mask wearing, social distancing and hand washing alongside vaccine programmes.

Mask wearing was adopted by many countries at the start of the pandemic, but nearly two years later many have now dropped some or all their original requirements.

The Dutch government this month decided to re-impose the mandatory wearing of face masks in an effort to slow the latest spike in infections.

"Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasted House minority leader Kevin McCarthy for failing to condemn the violent tweet of fellow Republican Paul Gosar ahead of a censure vote against him.

Earlier this month, Arizona congressman Gosar posted a video from his congressional Twitter account, asking, “Any anime fans out there?”
It included a video, which has since been removed, depicting the Republican lawmaker killing Ocasio-Cortez and swinging two swords at President Joe Biden.

Gosar, a loyalist of Donald Trump and one of the most far-right members of Congress, sat in the chamber and listened as his colleagues yesterday voted to censure him – the harshest form of punishment the chamber can hand out short of expulsion.

“This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a speech before the vote. “This is about what we are willing to accept ... What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?""

McCarthy and other Republican leaders have refused to publicly condemn Gosar for sharing the video and urged their caucus to oppose the sanction.

The censure was last night approved on a largely party-line vote with all Democrats and just two Republicans – Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Congressman Adam Kinzinger of
Illinois – voting in favor.

"Individuals could be stripped of their British citizenship without warning under a proposed rule change quietly added to the nationality and borders bill.

Clause 9 – “Notice of decision to deprive a person of citizenship” – of the controversial nationality and borders bill, which was updated earlier this month, exempts the government from having to give notice if it is not “reasonably practicable” to do so, or in the interests of national security, diplomatic relations or otherwise in the public interest.

Critics say removing citizenship, as in the case of Shamima Begum, who fled Britain as a schoolgirl to join Islamic State in Syria, is already a contentious power, and scrapping the requirement for notice would make the home secretary Priti Patel’s powers even more draconian.

Frances Webber, the vice-chair of the Institute of Race Relations, said: “This amendment sends the message that certain citizens, despite being born and brought up in the UK and having no other home, remain migrants in this country ... It builds on previous measures to strip British-born dual nationals (who are mostly from ethnic minorities) of citizenship and to do it while they are abroad, measures used mainly against British Muslims. It unapologetically flouts international human rights obligations and basic norms of fairness.”

Maya Foa, the director of the charity Reprieve, said: “This clause would give Priti Patel unprecedented power to remove your citizenship in secret, without even having to tell you, and effectively deny you an appeal ... This once again shows how little regard this government has for the rule of law.""

The Home Office said: “British citizenship is a privilege, not a right. Deprivation of citizenship on conducive grounds is rightly reserved for those who pose a threat to the UK or whose conduct involves very high harm. The nationality and borders bill will amend the law so citizenship can be deprived where it is not practicable to give notice, for example if there is no way of communicating with the person.”

"The freestyle motocross rider Tom Pages pulled off an amazing first in the ski resort of Avoriaz in France – riding off a sheer cliff and performing a double front flip before parachuting down.

@tompages attacked the seven-metre ramp at 50 mph and shot out more than 55 metres from the cliff before gliding back down to the ground.

After successfully completing two complete front flips, Pages released a specially designed parachute and glided to safety over the picturesque ravine. A second chute deployed on his motorcycle.

'What's going to get me stoked after that?' Pages said as he reflected on his achievement. 'I don't know. I'm going to have to find something even more stupid to have fun.'

Pages is no stranger to extreme sports: he is a multiple Red Bull X-Fighters champion and a five-time X Games gold medallist.

"Indigenous communities facing an upsurge in land grabs, water shortages and human rights violations as a result of the Cop26 deal have accused world leaders of sacrificing them in order to postpone meaningful climate action and shield corporate profits.

“The leaders pushing for market-based solutions and the commodification of our Mother Earth are signing a death sentence,"" said Thomas Joseph from the Hoopa tribe, located in California. 

The Glasgow deal creates a regulated global carbon trading market – a move widely supported by the world’s biggest polluters including the US – allowing countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying credits representing emission cuts by others.

Critics warn that carbon markets incentivise countries and corporations to offset – rather than cut – emissions responsible for global heating by investing in so-called green energy projects like biofuel monocrops and hydroelectric dams, which are linked to environmental destruction, forced displacement, arbitrary arrests and even murder.

In addition, such carbon credit schemes often rely on sequestering land, forests and rivers relied on by Indigenous and local communities for food, water, medicine and spiritual traditions, and there is little evidence to suggest they lead to a genuine drop in emissions.

In fact, global emissions have continued to soar since carbon credits were first incentivized under the voluntary Kyoto protocol in 1997, as have abuses against Indigenous and rural communities defending land rights and natural resources.

Now, Indigenous communities fear what’s coming next as the scope and scale of the new global carbon market – introduced in article 6 of the Paris accords – is much wider. Far more countries and industries, including the US, Saudi Arabia and civil aviation, will participate.

Andrea Xieu, a spokesperson for the Mexican collective Futuros Indígenas (Indigenous Futures) described the deal as an embarrassment that illustrated the murky influence of fossil fuel companies in Glasgow.

"From @guardian_sport: Naomi Osaka has joined the growing calls for answers on the whereabouts of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai, who has not been heard from publicly since she accused the country’s former vice premier of sexually assaulting her.

Peng, one of China’s biggest sporting stars, made the claims in a Weibo post more than a fortnight ago. She alleged that Zhang Gaoli had coerced her into sex and that they had an intermittent affair.

Osaka says she is ""shocked"" that Peng has ""gone missing shortly after revealing she has been sexually abused"". She added: ""Censorship is never OK at any cost, I hope Peng Shuai and her family are safe and OK. I’m in shock at the current situation and I’m sending love and light her way."" Osaka is one of many tennis players who have expressed concern over Peng’s silence.

The Chinese government has not responded to the allegations. A spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs told reporters he was not aware of the situation, saying: ""I have not heard of the issue you raised. This is not a diplomatic question.""

Peng’s post went viral despite it being taken down by censors within minutes. Subsequent posts and reactions, even keywords such as “tennis”, also appeared to be blocked, and numerous references to Peng were scrubbed from China’s internet. Peng’s Weibo account is active, but has no mention of Zhang and comments appear to have been disabled.

In her post, the 35-year-old alleged she and Zhang, 75, had an on-off extramarital ""relationship"" over several years, which she said he tried to keep secret. Peng said Zhang had stopped contacting her after he rose in the ranks of the Communist party. About three years ago, she alleged, Zhang invited her to play tennis with him and his wife and then sexually assaulted her in his house. “I never consented that afternoon, crying all the time,” she wrote.

"Online abuse is still rife almost two years after presenter Caroline Flack’s death, her friend and fellow broadcaster Laura Whitmore has said.

Speaking to the Guardian restaurant critic Grace Dent on the Comfort Eating podcast, Whitmore said not much had changed since Flack took her own life in February 2020. The presenter died following her arrest on charges of assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, which led to intense public and media scrutiny.

@thewhitmore, who took over from Flack in presenting ITV’s Love Island, said: “It’s hard because you would hope after something as shocking that you know, and something as horrific as what happened – I can’t even believe how long ago it is now, does it still feel so fresh – that some change will happen.”

Flack’s mother has previously said the media have failed to learn the lessons of her daughter’s death and must take responsibility for coverage of public figures struggling with mental health problems. Christine Flack said she hoped the outlets that “wrote all the horrible things about Caroline” would “take away that before they print anything, at least find out if it’s true. It’s someone’s life, it’s someone’s child, it’s someone’s sister or brother.” 

In her new interview with @gracedent, Whitmore added that: “There are certain papers I refuse to work with. And because of that, they will come for me and it’s hard. And it’s hard because I refuse to do an interview with them because of how they’ve treated friends of mine in the past or how they’ve written about them. And until they change, until they apologise or until they become better, I’m not going to work with them. But because of that, I’m fair game ...""

"Azeem Rafiq fought back tears as he told British lawmakers of the racist abuse he faced across two spells at Yorkshire cricket club.

@azeemrafiq30 told MPs: “Pretty early on at the club, I joined a dressing room full of my heroes ... And it was just the most surreal moment for me.

""Pretty early on, me and other people from an Asian background … there were comments such as ‘you’ll sit over there near the toilets’, ‘elephant washers’. The word ‘Paki’ was used constantly. And there just seemed to be an acceptance in the institution from the leaders and no one ever stamped it out.”

Rafiq first alleged racial harassment and bullying against the county last September, with the club launching an investigation soon afterwards. However, their handling of it has been heavily criticised. They finally published summary findings of the investigation this September and, while the investigation found there was “no question” Rafiq had been subjected to racial harassment and bullying, no individuals faced disciplinary action.

Today, Rafiq spoke in detail about former England batter and one-time Yorkshire captain Gary Ballance. Rafiq said Ballance racially abused him on a pre-season tour in 2017. “Gary Ballance walks over and goes: ‘Why are you talking to him? You know he’s a Paki.’ This happened in front of teammates. It happened in front of coaching staff.”

Rafiq went on opening up about how he and his wife lost their unborn son in 2017 and detailed the ‘inhuman’ treatment he received by certain people at Yorkshire.

Rafiq, who is a Muslim, also described his harrowing first experience of alcohol at the age of 15. “I got pinned down at my local cricket club and had red wine poured down my throat, literally down my throat,” he said. “... I wasn’t perfect, there are things I did which I felt I had to do to achieve my dreams. I deeply regret that but it has nothing to do with racism.

“When I spoke I should have been listened to. The game as a whole has a problem, with listening to the victim. There is no ‘yeah, but’ with racism; there is no ‘two sides’ to racism.”

"Thousands of children have returned to their classrooms after more than 18 months of home study in the Philippines, thought to be the last country to reopen schools since the start of the pandemic.

On Monday morning, 120 schools began on-site lessons through a pilot project. Footage by the broadcaster ABS CBN showed children at a school in Alaminos line up outside to take their temperatures, complete a health form and wash their hands before entering class.

Students, who wore face masks and face shields, sat at desks that were partially covered by plastic windows.

To reduce mixing, children are required to eat lunch at their desks and are only allowed to leave the classroom to go to the bathroom.

In September, Unicef identified six countries where schools have remained “almost completely closed” between March 2020 and 30 July 2021: the Philippines, Bangladesh, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Panama, which gradually reopened schools from 31 May. Of these countries, the Philippines is the last to begin resuming in-person teaching.

On top of school closures, children in the Philippines have also faced tough lockdown restrictions, including rules banning them from playing outside or in public spaces.

Until this month, children in the capital Manila have been barred from going to indoor restaurants, shops and arcades.

Education advocates said the prolonged closure of schools has had a major impact on children’s development and on their mental health.

President Rodrigo Duterte said in June 2020 that in-person classes would not return until a vaccine was available in the country.

Roughly a third of the population has been fully vaccinated and the country recently began offering vaccination for children aged 12 to 17.

Coronavirus cases in the Philippines have fallen since a peak in September, with the country now confirming an average of 2,065 cases over the past seven days, according to Our World in Data.

"My brother and his wife defended the environment: now they’re dead – by Claudelice dos Santos from Maraba, Brazil

When Zé Claudio and Maria were murdered it was as if the world had vanished from beneath our feet. 

We knew my brother and sister-in-law were being threatened for defending the environment – but we never imagined they’d actually be killed. The state knew about all the violence their community was suffering from land-grabbers and loggers, and nothing was done.

Ten years later it still hurts so much. Each morning I remember. Every day my mother cries. But we knew we wouldn’t find peace until there was real justice. So eventually we decided that rather than just mourning, we had to fight.

We were part of the struggle for social and environmental justice long before Zé Claudio and Maria were killed. But when you’re driven by pain and fear, and above all injustice, it makes you bolder. 

So I embraced my fear, my despair and my pain. Some days I couldn’t even get out of bed for fear of being shot because of the death threats I was getting. Or because I was consumed by the pain of losing Zé and Maria. I overcame all this because we believe change is possible.

What’s crucial is our capacity for resilience. And our ability to stand up and say: “I’ll fight. I’ll denounce things. I’ll ask the international community to pay attention. I will not remain silent.”

Everything Zé and Maria fought against while they were alive continues: the killings, the destruction of the forest.

This is a struggle that will never end because just when you think things couldn’t get any worse, along comes [Brazil’s president, Jair] Bolsonaro. Never in my worst nightmares could I have imagined we’d face such regression.

We’ve reached the limit of everything. Nature’s limit. The limit of our own strength. But we are still alive and we will continue to resist.

"""I wanted to create something that you can’t ignore.""

Ella Daish, a British environmental activist, is stepping up her campaign against single-use plastics in period products by calling on the world’s bestselling manufacturer of tampons to make greener alternatives.

The founder of the #EndPeriodPlastic campaign is today going to the European headquarters of Tampax-maker Procter & Gamble in Geneva to present executives with a giant tampon applicator, made of 1,200 discarded Tampax applicators found littering British waterways, rivers and beaches.

After a call on social media, Daish asked people across the UK to send her plastic tampon applicators they found polluting their local environment. She was sent boxes filled to the brim with discarded plastic applicators, found in all parts of the UK from the River Clyde to the Isles of Scilly.

@elladaish said she had met more than 10 retailers and manufacturers since launching her campaign in 2018, but US multinational Procter & Gamble had been the least responsive. “I am just fed up ... despite being the global leader of these products they are not doing anything. They are falling behind and every other manufacturer and retailer I’ve met is moving in the right direction.”

A spokesperson for Procter & Gamble said: “We wholeheartedly agree with Ella that plastics do not belong on beaches and we’re working to address this in line with European waste infrastructure ..."" 

The company added that they made reusable period products, as well as tampons with cardboard applicators. “We know that periods are a highly personal topic and what’s right for some is not necessarily right for all. Our goal is to find a solution where people with periods don’t have to compromise quality, while also having the absolute least impact on the earth.”

In 2019, the EU passed a law banning single-use plastic cutlery, plates, straws, stirrers and cotton buds, which came into effect in July 2021. The law didn't ban the use of plastics in tampons, pads and applicators, but requires companies to mark these products as containing plastic, with information about how to dispose of them correctly.

"The dangerously high environmental cost of fast fashion is impossible to ignore in these images.

They show at least 39,000 tonnes of discarded clothes dumped in Chile's Atacama desert. That's equal in weight to about 85,000 grand pianos.

The items are largely leftovers from the fast fashion industry, according to the news agency AFP, which published these images from September this week.

It found that about 59,000 tons of clothing end up at the port in Chile every year. Of that, at least 39,000 tons was moved into landfills in the desert.

“This clothing arrives from all over the world,” said Alex Carreno, a former employee in the port’s import area.

He said that as no one paid the necessary tariffs to take it away, ""what is not sold to Santiago nor sent to other countries stays in the free zone"".

Franklin Zepeda, the founder of EcoFibra, a company that makes insulation panels using discarded clothing, said: “The problem is that the clothing is not biodegradable and has chemical products, so it is not accepted in the municipal landfills.""

Zepeda, whose firm has been using textile waste to create its thermal and acoustic building insulators since 2018, said he wanted to ""stop being the problem and start being the solution"".

According to the World Economic Forum, the fashion industry produces 10% of all humanity’s carbon emissions, is the second largest consumer of water supplies, and is the seventh largest economy in the world.

"Like all elite athletes, Julia “Hurricane” Hawkins, 105, has a ruthless streak. So, despite setting a 100m world record last weekend at the Louisiana Senior Games, she still wants to go faster.

“It was wonderful to see so many family members and friends. But I wanted to do it in less than a minute,” she said after the race, where she recorded a time of 1:02:95, a record for women in the 105+ age category. When someone pointed out that 102 is less than her age and asked if that made her feel better, Hawkins answered: “No”.

The retired teacher is no stranger to athletic excellence. She started competing at the National Senior Games when she was 80, specialising in cycling time trials, and won several gold medals. She eventually ended her cycling career saying that “there wasn’t anyone left my age to compete with”.

When she turned 100 she took up sprinting. In 2017 she set the 100m world record for women over the age of 100 with a time of 39:62. When her record was broken in September by Diane Friedman, Hawkins decided to compete in a new age category.

“I love to run, and I love being an inspiration to others,” Hawkins said. “I want to keep running as long as I can. My message to others is that you have to stay active if you want to be healthy and happy as you age.”

"“This discovery made it one of the happiest days of lockdown.”

A new species of dinosaur with an extremely large nose has been identified by a retired GP who spent lockdown rummaging through boxes of ancient bones.

Jeremy Lockwood, who is studying for a PhD at the University of Portsmouth, set himself the task of cataloguing every bone from an iguanodon - a type of dinosaur - discovered on the Isle of Wight.

As he sorted the bones from the collections of the Natural History Museum in London and the Dinosaur Isle museum on the Isle of Wight, he discovered a specimen with a unique “bulbous” nasal bone.

After four years of unpacking and studying boxes of bones, he began reconstructing the skull of a specimen that had been in storage since 1978 and found several striking features that set it apart.

“The number of teeth was a sign,” Lockwood said. “Mantellisaurus has 23 or 24, but this has 28. It also had a bulbous nose, whereas the other species have very straight noses. Altogether, these and other small differences made it very obviously a new species.”

The herbivorous dinosaur was about eight metres in length and weighed about 900kg.

Lockwood, who was also involved in the discovery of another new species known as the “hell heron”, said the latest discoveries showed British dinosaurs were not “done and dusted”.

“I think we could be on to a bit of a renaissance,” he added.

"A train driver in Japan is suing his employer after it docked ¥43 (28p) from his wages over a one-minute delay that he claims was not his fault.

West Japan Railway Company (JR West) said it withheld the tiny sum by applying its strict “no work, no pay” principle over the incident, which occurred in June last year.

The dispute arose after the driver, who had been scheduled to move an empty train to a depot at Okayama station in western Japan, realised he was waiting at the wrong platform.

His mistake held up the driver transfer at the correct platform by one-minute and caused a further one-minute delay to the train’s arrival at the depot, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.

JR West said it was entitled to dock the driver’s pay as he had not been working during the mix-up.

The driver, however, told Okayama district court that the delay was caused by “human error” and that he should not have been considered absent from work, adding that there was no disruption to train timetables.

He is now seeking the ¥43 plus ¥13 overtime, as well as ¥2.2m damages for the mental anguish caused by his employer’s decision, the newspaper said.

The case is a reminder of the Japanese railway network’s enviable record on punctuality, with even very brief delays prompting repeated apologies to passengers.

"“Will they let us die here?”

Those are the words of Hiwa, the father of two-year-old Arias. He has been rationing the amount of water he can give his son by using a bottle cap as refugees and migrants continue to be stranded on the Polish-Belarusian border

According to activists, Hiwa and his family are Kurds fleeing discrimination in Iraq. “Belarus won’t allow us to return to Minsk. Poland won’t let us into the country. They are using us ... I think that Belarus is not giving us food or water to force Poland into helping,” Hiwa said in a message sent to Polish campaigners and posted on Instagram by @majakstasko.

At least eight people have died since the beginning of the humanitarian and political crisis with Belarus, which is accused of deliberately provoking a new refugee crisis in Europe by organising the movement of people from the Middle East to Minsk and promising them safe passage to the EU in revenge for the sanctions Brussels has imposed on its authoritarian regime. Poland, which has deployed approximately 20,000 border police, has been accused in turn of violently pushing thousands of people back across the border.

Hiwa said that he has been burning dry wood to keep his wife and son warm during the cold nights, and the family have been forced to ration their dwindling water supply.

""It is silent and all you can hear is the terrifying wailing of a child. I don’t know how to sleep. What will happen tomorrow? I hope that I can provide my child with a different future than my life. I am afraid for them, I want them to be healthy, nothing else,” Hiwa said in a message sent at 2:25 am.

The true numbers of those who have died and are attempting to cross the border are hard to estimate as the Polish government has declared a state of emergency in areas surrounding the Belarus border and is refusing humanitarian aid workers, journalists and EU observers access to the area.

"""Australia needs to wake up to themselves ... we need to do better in terms of our politicians,"" says Aboriginal climate activist Amelia Telford.

The 27-year-old has spoken to us for the latest episode in our mini-series profiling young Indigenous activists.

As the national director of the Australian Indigenous climate activism organisation @seedmob, Telford explains the importance of decolonising how we think of our place on Earth, the resources we use, and the things we 'need', and instead learning from Indigenous knowledge and values.

"These surreal and striking images were taken by @emilio_morenatti on the Spanish island of La Palma where the Cumbre Vieja volcano has been erupting for over two months.

The images show homes, playgrounds and even graves completely covered by ash. 

The volcano erupted on 19 September and is showing few signs of abating so far after destroying over 2,000 buildings and forcing over 7,000 people to leave their homes.

The Spanish government has pledged 225 million euros (£192 million) in aid to help La Palma residents.

The recent volcanic eruption is the first since 1971 on La Palma, which has a population of 85,000 and part of the Canary Islands archipelago off north-west Africa.

The tension of not knowing whether the slow-moving molten rock will eventually entomb their homes, farmland and businesses is taking a toll on local people. ‘There is already a certain degree of despondency and desperation, waiting for the volcano to subside,” said the mayor of Tazacorte, Juan Miguel Rodríguez.

Volcanic ash can damage people’s airways, lungs and eyes. The local government has urged residents in affected areas to avoid going outside and only do so wearing masks and goggles.

Experts said that predicting when the eruption will end is difficult because lava, ash and gases emerging to the surface are a reflection of complex geological activity happening deep down the earth and far from the reach of currently available technology.

"There is no way out of this climate emergency without the empowerment of women: that is the resounding message from many leaders and campaigners at Cop26.

Speaking to delegates at the climate summit, Angelica Ponce, executive director of the Plurinational Authority for Mother Earth in Bolivia, said: “The world as designed by men has destroyed many things. The world should begin thinking like women. If it was designed by a woman, it would end violence against women and children.

“We want to be in the corridors of power and take part in decisions at international level to end this struggle of climate justice,” she said. “As Indigenous women, we live day-by-day the cruel reality of climate change in our land.”

Women and girls around the world suffer disproportionately from the impacts of climate breakdown, as they are on average poorer, less educated and more dependent on subsistence farming. A UN report found 80% of those displaced by the climate emergency are women.

The focus on gender equality yesterday saw many more Indigenous women and politicians including Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, demand increased investment.

Sturgeon said: “When world leaders gathered here last week, of the 120 or so, a tiny minority were women – that needs to change and it needs to change quickly. There is no doubt, we must ensure that climate change is a feminist issue. [But] women are not pleading to be supported. We’re demanding to be empowered.”

Pelosi said: “If I ruled the world, the one thing that I would do is invest in the education of women. When women succeed, the world succeeds.”

Climate-related events will prevent at least 4 million girls in lower-income countries from completing their education in 2021, he said, citing a Malala Fund report. On current trends, the climate crisis will contribute to at least 12.5 million girls not completing their education each year, the report said.

"Do you think this is a ""game changer""?

Lawmakers in Portugal have passed new rules which say companies must avoid contacting workers outside office hours, as well as contribute to expenses resulting from remote working, such as electricity and internet bills.

Under the new labour laws – passed by parliament as a result of the explosion in home-working – employers could face fines for contacting staff after work, except under exceptional circumstances.

Portugal's ruling Socialist Party have also decided that companies should be forbidden from monitoring their staff while they work at home.

The new rules won't however apply to companies with fewer than ten employees.

Speaking to the Web Summit Conference in Lisbon last week, Portugal's minister of labour and social security, said: ""The pandemic has accelerated the need to regulate what needs to be regulated,"" she said.

""Telework can be a 'game changer' if we profit from the advantages and reduce the disadvantages"".

""We consider Portugal one of the best places in the world for these digital nomads and remote workers to choose to live in, we want to attract them to Portugal,"" she told the Web Summit audience.

"The weight of about 2,000 double decker buses has leaked into the ocean, new research has revealed, and it's all plastic waste from the Covid-19 pandemic.

The 26,000 tonnes of mismanaged plastic waste consists of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves.

“The pandemic has led to an increased demand for single-use plastics that intensifies pressure on an already out-of-control global plastic waste problem,” said Yiming Peng and Peipei Wu from Nanjing University, the authors of the study published in the online journal PNAS.

“The released plastics can be transported over long distances in the ocean, encounter marine wildlife, and potentially lead to injury or even death,” they added.

A study in March presented the first case of a fish entrapped in a medical glove, encountered during a canal cleanup in Leiden, the Netherlands. In Brazil, a PFF-2 protective mask was found in the stomach of a dead Magellanic penguin.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, an estimated 8.4m tonnes of plastic waste has been generated from 193 countries, according to the new report, published on Monday.

The Chinese study found that 46% of the mismanaged plastic waste came from Asia, due to the high level of mask-wearing by individuals there, followed by Europe, 24%, and North and South America, 22%.

Peng and Wu said their research suggested 87.4% of the excess waste was from hospitals, rather than from individual use. PPE usage by individuals contributed only 7.6% of the total, while packaging and test kits accounted for 4.7% and 0.3% respectively.

The scientists predicted that by the end of the century almost all pandemic-associated plastics will end up on either the seabed or on beaches.

"Women's rights activist and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai has married her partner, Asser Malik, in a small ceremony in Birmingham, England.

The world’s youngest winner of the Nobel peace prize confirmed the news on her Instagram account saying; “Today marks a precious day in my life. Asser and I tied the knot to be partners for life.""

“We celebrated a small nikkah [Islamic marriage contract] ceremony at home in Birmingham with our families. Please send us your prayers. We are excited to walk together for the journey ahead.”

Although the pair have been private about their relationship, @malala and Asser are said to have known each other for at least three years. According to his Linkedin profile, Asser works in the sports industry and is currently employed by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

Now 24, Yousafzai won the Nobel peace prize in 2014 at the age of 17, alongside the Indian children’s rights activist Kailash Satyarthi, for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people.

Yousafzai began blogging for the BBC in 2009 about her experiences during the Taliban’s growing influence in the Swat Valley region of Pakistan. Attempting to silence her, the Taliban shot the then 15-year-old in the head in 2012. She survived, later writing in her book: “Instead of silencing me, they amplified my voice beyond Pakistan"".

She has continued to campaign for girls’ education while graduating from Oxford University last year with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, politics and economics (PPE).

"Do you think this is fair?

As Singapore grapples with a surge in cases, the government has announced it will no longer pay the Covid-19 medical bills for people “unvaccinated by choice”.

The full Covid medical costs for all Singaporeans is currently covered, as well as permanent residents and long-term visa holders, unless they test positive soon after returning home from overseas.

However from 8 December, the government said it will start charging unvaccinated Covid patients who “make up a sizeable majority of those who require intensive in-patient care and disproportionately contribute to the strain on our healthcare resources”.

Covid-related medical bills will still be paid for people who aren’t eligible for a vaccine. The government said it will also foot the bill for individuals who are partially vaccinated until 31 December, giving them time to get a second dose.

Singapore has among the highest coverage rates in the world, with 85% of the eligible population fully vaccinated. Yet the city state is struggling with rising Covid infections and last month warned its healthcare system was at risk of being “overwhelmed” by surging cases.

It came a day after the country expanded quarantine-free travel as part of a shift in its approach to dealing with the pandemic.

The prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, previously said the global business hub could not remain closed indefinitely, and Singapore has moved from a zero-tolerance strategy with lockdowns and closed borders to living with Covid-19.

On 8 November, the country reported 2,470 new cases and 14 deaths. The ministry of heath said 67 Covid cases were critically ill in intensive care.

"What time do you go to bed?

A new study suggests there may also be an optimal time to nod off – at least when it comes to heart health. Not too early and not too late, with the sweet spot being between 10pm and 11pm.

The research, published in the journal European Heart Journal – Digital Health, collected data from more than 88,000 participants who wore wrist-based devices for seven days to explore whether there was an association with the time that participants fell asleep at night.

It concluded that going to sleep at 10pm or shortly after is associated with a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared with falling asleep earlier or later at night.

The study cannot prove that early or late bedtimes contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease though – not least since when people fall asleep may be linked to other health conditions or behaviours, such as staying out late and drinking, that may be linked to cardiovascular disease risk. Moreover, the research did not look closely at the quality of the participants’ sleep, only length and timing.

However, Dr David Plans, the head of research at Huma Therapeutics and senior lecturer at the University of Exeter, who co-authored the study, said one possibility was that early or late bedtimes might result in individuals missing important cues such as morning daylight, which help to reset the body’s internal clock each day.

If the body clock is not reset properly over a long period of time, “that misalignment of behaviours and the circadian clock increases inflammation and can impair glucose regulation, both of which can increase risk of cardiovascular disease”, Plans said.

The study has further limitations, including that it is based only on data from adults aged 43 to 79, and participants of the UK Biobank – a database of genetic and lifestyle information that researchers are using to investigate myriad health issues – are predominantly white.

Plans said further research, with more participants, is needed to examine the findings, adding there was not enough evidence at present to prescribe a particular bedtime to the public.

"Overstone Kondowe’s historic election as Malawi's first MP with albinism has been hailed as a “giant step forward in the protection of human rights of people with albinism in Malawi and Africa as whole”.

In the southern African country, and many other parts of the continent, people with the hereditary lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes face severe discrimination and physical attacks - meaning many children often do not go to school.

Both Malawi and neighbouring Tanzania have a long history of people with albinism being killed for their body parts, which fetch high prices, as they are used in rituals, witchcraft and are believed to bring good luck.

But Kondowe, who took his seat in the new parliament on Monday, hopes his election has set a precedent in a country where 134,636 people are living with albinism. ""The victory is a clear demonstration that people are changing their altitudes,” he said.

The 42-year-old son of a teacher, grew up in a village without any help to ease the pain in his sun-sensitive skin or glasses to aid his poor eyesight.

Despite struggling to see what was written on the blackboard, Kondowe worked his way through school and university to achieve high-level positions in both the government and in non-governmental organisations.

Kondowe, a former president of Malawi’s Association of People with Albinism (APAM), has said that although attacks for body parts had been reduced, thanks to a handful of high-profile prosecutions, there was still a long way to go - and that he plans to work for legislation to protect all people with disabilities.

Ikponwosa Ero, a former UN adviser on albinism, said she was “elated” by Kondowe’s election, which she called a “giant step forward"". Meanwhile, Charles Mailosi, 29, a teacher from Lilongwe who has albinism, said he was excited by Kondowe’s victory.

“This is a powerful sign that Malawians are accepting [us],” he said.

“It gives me courage that I can achieve greater things in life and that people can trust me.”

"Tuvalu’s foreign minister has recorded a speech for the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow – standing knee-deep in seawater to highlight how the low-lying Pacific Island nation is on the frontline of the climate crisis.

Images of Simon Kofe standing in a suit and tie at a lectern set up in the sea, with his trouser legs rolled up, have been shared widely on social media, drawing attention to the fact that Tuvalu is one of the countries considered most at risk of disappearing due to sea level rise.

Before the Cop26 summit, it emerged that one-third of Pacific small island states and territories would be unable to send any government figures for the talks in Scotland due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.

Many big polluters have vowed to intensify their carbon cuts over coming decades with some aiming for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But Pacific Island leaders have demanded immediate action, pointing out that the very survival of their low-lying countries is at stake.

"Picture your day before you started to read this: what did you do?

In every single moment – getting out of bed, turning on a tap, flicking the kettle switch – your brain was blasted with information.

Each second, the eyes will give the brain the equivalent of 10m bits (binary digits) of data. The ears will take in an orchestra of sound waves. Then there’s our thoughts: the average person, researchers estimate, will have more than 6,000 a day. To get anything done, we have to filter out most of this data. We have to focus.

Focusing has felt particularly tough during the pandemic.

Books are left half-read; eyes wander away from Zoom calls; conversations stall. My inability to concentrate on anything – work, reading, cleaning, cooking – without being distracted over the past 18 months has felt, at times, farcical.

The good news? We can learn to focus better, but we need to think about attention differently. It is not something we can just choose to do. We have to train the brain like a muscle. Specifically, with short bursts of daily exercises.

Dr Amishi Jha - a professor of cognitive and behavioural neuroscience at the University of Miami - has written a book called Peak Mind: Find Your Focus, Own Your Attention, Invest 12 Minutes a Day, a four-week training programme based on her research showing how simple mindfulness exercises carried out by people with high-demand jobs, such as soldiers, elite athletes and emergency medics, improve many aspects of cognitive and emotional health, including strengthening our attention.

She spoke to Guardian contributor and trainee psychotherapist Eleanor Morgan about five things we can do to focus better.

"A missing 16-year-old girl was rescued in the US after using a hand gesture that signals distress or domestic violence to capture the attention of a passing driver.

The teenager was spotted travelling inside a silver Toyota near London, Kentucky, about 150 miles south-east of Louisville, on 4 November.

A motorist called police after noticing “a female passenger in the vehicle making hand gestures that are known on the social media platform TikTok to represent violence at home – I need help – domestic violence,” the Laurel County Sheriff’s Office said.

The caller noted that the girl “appeared to be in distress” and was being driven by an older male.

Laurel sheriff’s investigators positioned themselves to watch for the passing Toyota and intercepted the vehicle as it exited the highway.

Deputies conducted a traffic stop and a subsequent investigation revealed the teenager had been reported missing by her parents days earlier.

Police say the teenager told investigators that she traveled with the man through North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio. Authorities allege she had been attempting to get motorists attention to call 911.

Following the police stop, a 61-year-old man was arrested at the scene and charged with unlawful imprisonment.

The hand gesture reportedly used by the teenager to signal violence or distress is believed to have been first introduced by the Canadian Women’s Foundation last year. It has been adopted by women around the world who need to discreetly ask for help, or show they are in distress.

The gesture is a hand up, palm out, with the thumb tucked, then folding the fingers down.

"These words were written by Brianna Rodriguez's family in a fundraising post for the 16-year-old's funeral. She was killed during a crush at rapper Travis Scott's Astroworld festival show in Texas.

Eight people - aged from 14 to 27 years old - were killed and dozens more injured in what is one of the deadliest live music events in US history.

About 50,000 people were in the audience at NRG Park in Houston on Friday when the crowd started pushing towards the stage as Scott was performing, triggering chaotic scenes.

Details of the victims who died during the surge have begun to emerge. 

Danish Baig, 27, reportedly died while attempting to save his fiancee. Franco Patino, a student in Ohio, and his friend Jacob Jurinek, both 21, died after having saved up to go to the event together. The youngest of five siblings, Rudy Pena, 23, also died. His sister said he was “the sweetest person” and a big Travis Scott fan.

Organisers and Scott are facing questions about why he continued performing when first responders were already dealing with a mass casualty event.

A fan using the Instagram handle SeannaFaith gave a harrowing account of how their cries for help were apparently ignored by guards. “The rush of people became tighter and tighter … Breathing became something only a few were capable. The rest were crushed or unable to breathe in the thick hot air,” the user wrote, describing people falling to the ground, “like watching a Jenga tower topple. Person after person were sucked down.”

Both Scott and the Canadian rapper Drake, who joined Scott’s headline set, have been sued for having “incited mayhem” during the concert, a law firm has confirmed. Neither Scott or Drake have commented on the suit.

In an earlier tweet posted on Saturday, Scott said he was “absolutely devastated by what took place”. He pledged to work “together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need” - and added that he could “just not imagine the severity of the situation” from the stage.

"How the climate crisis upended my life - by Vanessa Nieuwenhuizen in Samoa: 

It was the day before we were supposed to fly to Australia for a family reunion and Christmas in 2012, so it was a very exciting day to start off with. There was a cyclone due to hit Samoa. It started to rain really heavily and by the afternoon we started seeing water rising just around the house.

At around 4.30, I heard my husband screaming outside and I knew something was very wrong. By the time I made it outside, there was a massive gush of water coming towards our house, like an inland tsunami.

My husband yelled to grab the kids. My baby was sitting on the toilet. I grabbed him by the arm. The water was rising so quickly that by the time we made it out of the house, the water was up to our hips. 

We have four children and so my husband and I had one child on each arm as we waded through the water. There was one point where my husband and I looked at each other and in my anxious mind I thought: please, please, Heavenly Father, don’t let us have to make a decision to let one of our children go.

We all made it through, thank goodness. But the thought of having to let go of one of our children, I wouldn’t wish it upon any parent.

We made it into the workshop, and climbed the stairs towards the little storeroom. Our entire house was gone, our cars had been washed away, big machines in our workshop that had been bolted to the ground had washed away – that’s how strong the water was. We stayed up in the storeroom for several hours, wrapped in old, dirty curtains to keep ourselves warm. I remember thinking: if we make it out alive, how and where are we going to start all over again?

We had an amazing life in Samoa but after we lost everything in that flash flood, we decided to move to Australia. Australia has been kind to us, but as much as we say this is home, Samoa will always be home. I miss Samoa. Every occasion, my thoughts turn to home, and I still cry.

"Morgan Howell is giving classic rock'n'roll singles new dimensions - by creating giant 3D paintings of them complete with crinkled sleeves.

The painter hopes they will make people start reminiscing about a certain song and the role it has played in their life.

Howell's work covers records released between 1953 and 1984, before picture sleeves largely replaced the company sleeves - which he says gave every artist the same chance; ""It was a level playing field. David Bowie and some guy that you’ve never heard of were stuck in the same sleeve. There were no fancy pictures or gimmicks – just the record bag.""

Before deciding on a song to cover, Howell often buys multiple copies of a seven-inch single from around the world - researching the song on different labels or from various countries. He says a sticker or price label is always a bonus, because it helps to tell a story.

""The music itself will always exist, of course, but that first moment it entered the world and how it was packaged does not. The 45s are tucked away in collections and in dusty boxes. No one sees them or thinks about what they represent.""

"If wine growers adapted relatively well to the Covid-19 crisis last year, they were now “confronting a much greater problem than the pandemic: climate change,” said director of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) Paul Roca.

World wine production is expected to fall to one of its lowest levels on record after harsh weather battered vineyards in Europe’s major wine-producing regions.

The conditions “severely impacted” production in Italy, Spain and France, resulting in “extremely low” production volumes, an international wine body has said.

In the midst of the shortage, demand is expected to recover to near levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV).

They said a drop in production in Italy, Spain and France, the world’s largest wine producers, would outweigh what is forecast to be the highest-ever volume in the southern hemisphere.

Vineyards in western Europe were hit by spring frosts, while French producers also endured heavy rain, hail and mildew disease.

Global consumption trends were encouraging, with first-half data suggesting a rebound despite ongoing disruption to tourism and hospitality linked to the coronavirus pandemic, the OIV said.

“We still expect the global consumption to increase compared to 2020,” Pau Roca, the OIV’s director general, told reporters, noting first-half trade data showed volumes above pre-pandemic levels.

While “there is no vaccine” against climate change, he said “there are long-term solutions which will require major efforts in terms of sustainable practices for cultivating vines and producing wine”. He said adaptation was an “urgent necessity” for the industry.

"Marvel’s latest big-budget adventure Eternals has been pulled from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait after Disney reportedly refused to cut a same-sex kiss; the first onscreen LGBTQ kiss in the franchise.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the $200m movie will not be released in some countries in the Gulf region after being removed from local sites.

The studio has yet to comment or confirm but sources claim that the reason is because of a kiss between Brian Tyree Henry’s character, Atlanta, and his on-screen husband, Little America, played by Haaz Sleiman.

Homosexuality is still illegal across much of the region and is punishable by death in both Saudi Arabia and Qatar. A local cinema chain confirmed to the trade that the film was “banned” but had no explanation provided.

In Singapore, Eternals has become the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to gain an M18 certificate, which restricts audiences to those aged 18 and older. A spokesperson for the country’s Infocomm Media Development Authority confirmed that it was a result of “homosexual references”. The film also contains a sex scene between two heterosexual characters.

Director Chloe Zhao, who won the Oscar for best director earlier this year for Nomadland, spoke recently about her desire to not tweak any scenes to appease censors.

Lebanese actor Sleiman, who came out as gay in 2017, spoke about the importance of the scene at the film’s premiere. “It’s life-saving,” he said to Variety. “Can you imagine how many lives this is going to be saving – kids, young queer folk, who are being bullied, committing suicide, and not seeing themselves being represented? And now they get to see this – it’s above and beyond.”

Oil lamps lit up windows, shops, homes and monuments across the country and devotees gathered at temples and shrines, as excitement over the festival, severely dampened last year by Covid-19, gripped the country once more.

In the holy city of Ayodhya in the state of Uttar Pradesh, 900,000 earthen lamps were lit on the banks of the Sarayu River as dusk fell on Wednesday. Hindus believe the city is the birthplace of the god Ram. In Amritsar, the Sikh Golden temple was enveloped in fairy lights.

In accordance with longstanding tradition to mark the festival, the armies of India and Pakistan exchanged sweets at the Tithwal crossing bridge on the Line of Control that divides parts of Kashmir.

The Hindu festival represents new beginnings, but for many who lost their relatives and loved ones in the devastating second wave that swept through India last spring it was the first Diwali without family members.

Shriya Chatterjee, 42, whose mother died in April from the virus, said the festival would not be the same without her. ""She had all these traditions she would make us do every year and would boss us all around to make sure everything was perfect. It would drive me crazy but now this year I’m making sure we celebrate as she would have. But I’ve avoided parties and we are keeping it small, to be cautious because we know that Covid hasn’t gone away.”

India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, had urged people to take precautions and to be wary of Covid. Though, in the capital, celebrations were in full swing in the days leading up to the festival.

For residents there, the morning of Diwali also brought with it the annual spectre of pollution as air quality hit hazardous levels. Levels of PM2.5 – the smallest and most harmful particles polluting the air – peaked at an average of 389 on Thursday. The figure is more than 15 times higher than the safe limits set by the World Health Organization.

"""Indigenous peoples have done more than any government in fighting climate change"".

Those are the words of @ninagualinga from the Kichwa peoples in the Ecuadorian Amazon. We spoken to her for the latest episode in our mini-series profiling young Indigenous climate activists during the Cop26 conference - looking at sustainable climate solutions based on centuries of Indigenous knowledge, spiritual customs and traditions.

Nina and her community have been protecting the Amazon rainforest from fossil fuel industries for decades: she explained to us why Indigenous people need to be given decision-making power at Cop26 and beyond.

"The California condor is the largest flying bird in North America: it has a wingspan that enables it to soar up to 15,000ft – nearly half the height of a commercial airplane.

Now the birds can claim another remarkable feat: scientists have discovered that females can reproduce without a male partner, in a rare phenomenon known as parthenogenesis.

Oliver Ryder, the director of conservation genetics for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, has called the recent findings a “eureka moment”.

Condors have been imperilled for a century. As Europeans settled the west, they often shot, poisoned and captured the condors, collected their eggs, and reduced their food supply of antelope, elk, and other large wild animals. Their population declined steadily until only 22 remained in 1982, but a state-led recovery program has since successfully bred the animals back from the brink.

The journey that led to discovering the condor’s asexual reproduction also began in the 1980s, when the San Diego Zoo was tasked with developing a test to determine the sex of the few remaining wild condors. Ryder remembers the conversation with his colleague about the strange cases. He got goosebumps as he realized that the condors had reproduced through parthenogenesis – a form of reproduction in which an egg can develop into an embryo without being fertilized by a sperm. 

Condors can live into their 50s, but both of the male chicks born of asexual reproduction were relatively small and died before becoming sexually mature, at 1.9 and 7.9 years old.

Parthenogenesis is derived from the Greek words for “virgin birth” and several insect species including aphids, bees and ants are known to reproduce through the process, although the phenomenon is rare in birds.

The condor is still considered a threatened species, and it remains unclear what solo reproduction will mean in terms of helping with conservation efforts. 

But Ryder says he is delighted that the bird is rewriting scientific understanding; “This is really wondrous and amazing - in the midst of an extinction crisis, scientists are still making big discoveries.”

"In an in-depth interview, actor Salma Hayek has spoken about her time working on the film Frida with convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein, who produced the movie.

Here's a snippet from the piece by our columnist Hadley Freeman:

In 2017, Hayek wrote a blistering piece for the New York Times, detailing how he sexually harassed her for years, and how she kept saying no:

“No to me taking a shower with him. No to letting him watch me take a shower. No to letting him give me a massage. No to letting a naked friend of his give me a massage. No to letting him give me oral sex. No to my getting naked with another woman. No no no no no … And with every refusal came Harvey’s Machiavellian rage.”

""Hayek, understandably, isn’t super-excited about rehashing this particular part of her history: “It’s so boring and old!” she groans. But when I tell her that Weinstein bullied me, got me banned from restaurants and parties and even wrote an article about me because he didn’t like things I’d written, she perks right up.""

“Now I want to interview you! Now, this is an interesting conversation because, if you really look at my piece, you’ll see that I really focused on the bullying [rather than the sexual harassment], and I do think women got it worse [from him].” Weinstein “is not the only man to reassure himself by knowing he can destroy women,” she says.

I ask if she normalised his bullying as a way to cope with it.

“To a degree. And I did feel all right [when he bullied me]. OK, I would shake [afterwards] and it did depress me, but there was a cartoon aspect about the whole thing. When he would call me up [during the making of Frida] and scream, ‘Why do you have a [monobrow] and moustache? I didn’t hire you to look ugly!’ I was like, ‘But didn’t you ever look at a picture of Frida Kahlo?’ If a man was playing Cyrano de Bergerac, he wouldn’t say, ‘What’s with the nose?’”

By the way, she says, Weinstein was “not the first or last one” who treated her like that. In Hollywood or in general?

“In general! We’re girls! … So you learn to be brave. It’s not easy, but you have to.”

"The disruption from the climate emergency being experienced by marine wildlife has seemingly reached a new high.

In the first week of the Cop26 summit, a female walrus was discovered sleeping on a Dutch submarine in a naval base in North Holland.

Freya, as the animal has been named, is the first of her species to visit the Netherlands in 23 years. Walruses normally live in the polar regions – several hundred miles north.

She was spotted snoozing on the submarine in the naval port of Den Helder by Jeroen Hoekendijk, a Dutch scientist specialising in marine mammals.

Freya is thought to have swum south from her Arctic comfort zone, following the Danish and German coasts.

While she appears to be in good health, Hoekendijk – who observed the animal feeding on razor clams earlier – noted a raw wound in her front flippers.

This particular animal is one of at least two of the species that have been seen far from their Arctic habitat. Another wandering walrus, seen off the Scilly Islands, France, Spain and West Cork in Ireland has since been sighted back in Icelandic waters.

Social media users quipped that the Arctic mammal showed an “excellent example of animal-initiated civil resistance”, and that “considering military are huge contributors to carbon emissions, the walrus is probably protesting climate justice”.

"Right now in Glasgow, there are hundreds of protesters taking part in a 'Greenwash' march - as the Cop26 summit takes place around them.

The activists are trying to draw attention to the ""climate criminals"" who are ""greenwashing rather than showing the real leadership needed to tackle climate breakdown"", according to the event page of the group Extinction Rebellion - who organised the action.

The UN conference, which is taking place until 12 November, has already seen a score of promises and commitments by governments and world leaders to properly confront the climate crisis - and to set the world on a path to limit global heating to 1.5C.

But even just this week, Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro was accused by activist of greenwashing as he made big promises to stop the deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.

Campaigners say they fear empty promises at Cop26 may gain countries access to conservation money, but that the world should pay more attention to the destructive policies of the recent past than vague promises about the future.

"How bad are emissions from key polluting countries?

As world leaders descend on Glasgow for vital United Nations Cop26 climate talks, seen as one of the last chances to prevent environmental breakdown, they will try their utmost to be seen to be taking action.

But when it comes to the data, where do the biggest polluters really stand?

To help get a clearer picture, our environment team has created data profiles for individual countries, using the most recent available data from the UN, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), IEA Statistics and Climate Action Tracker (CAT).

The information is broken down into five key categories: total greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse gas emissions per capita, modern renewables share in final energy consumption, any current net zero target and CAT rating.

At the top of the leaderboard for total emissions is China, which is rated “highly insufficient” by CAT, and has a net zero target of “before 2060”. And in second place is the US, which in 2019 emitted 19.77 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita of greenhouse gases.

The UK, co-host of Cop26, is rated “almost sufficient” by CAT, but despite being home to the world’s largest offshore wind energy market, in 2019 its renewable energy share was only 12.2% – considerably lower than the overall EU figure of 18.2% and far behind other European countries including the other co-host Italy (17.3%), Portugal (28.2%) and Norway (62.4%). Meanwhile, big polluters Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, none of which have set net zero targets, were among those classed as “critically insufficient”.

First up from Chad, Indigenous women's leader, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, has a stark warning for world leaders: ""sit down, shut up and listen"".

Speaking in Glasgow today, she added: “I can come to this leader’s event with a simple message- we have the map, we know where we are going, we know how to drive, so pass the key.”

Despite only making up around 6% of the global population, Indigenous people protect 80% of biodiversity left in the world. So, without question, we have many important lessons to learn.

"The president of the Pacific island nation of Palau has told the Cop26 summit that parallels can be drawn between the climate crisis and the tradition Palau story of a boy who grew into a giant who “wouldn’t stop growing”.

“Due to his unruly appetite, the whole island community was forced to feed him ... depleting all the natural resources,"" said Surangel Whipps Jr to fellow world leaders in Glasgow.

He explained how the islanders ultimately set the boy on fire after he turned on them and tried to eat them - and pointed out that the story was “eerily reminiscent” of today’s climate emergency.

“Large emitters with insatiable appetites are continuing to abuse our environment, threatening our very survival. Cop26 must light the fire.”

He added that “devastated” island nations such as Palau, demand that commitments of $100bn annually be increased to meet the $4tn the World Bank says is needed to tackle the climate crisis.

“We see the scorching sun is giving us intolerable heat, the warming sea is invading us and the winds are blowing us every which way, our resources are disappearing before our eyes and our future is being robbed from us,” he added.

“Frankly speaking, there is no dignity to a slow and painful death - you might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer only to witness our slow and painful demise.”

"""I think Ghoramara will disappear underwater within 10 or 15 years.""

Throughout the 2021 UN climate change conference, Cop26, we will be publishing the stories of the people whose lives have been devastated by the climate breakdown.

This is Sunil Kandar's story:

I live in the Hatkhola locality of Ghoramara [in India]. I remember how on this island, during my childhood, I had a very happy and enjoyable life. We had a big mud-walled house. We also had large farmland of our own where rice and other vegetables grew. We sold a big part of our farm produce in the market. Like some other families in the island we were pretty rich. The farmland owned by our family was our biggest strength.

Our island is located at the mouth of a river coming from the north. The northern edge of the island began sinking bit by bit under the river water when I was a child. Then, 20 or 25 years ago, the sea began eating away land around the southern edge of the island where we lived. Ghoramara began going underwater almost from all sides and the island began shrinking fast. Farmlands and houses of the people are constantly going underwater.

Cyclones are pounding our island more frequently in recent years. The fragile island is too feeble to keep away the tidal waves... Whatever farmlands are left on the island are turning unusable because of inundation by seawater and increasing salinity of the soil.

Once I owned four acres of farmland. In the past 20 years, three-quarters of it has been lost under the sea. This year I have been forced to buy rice for us, for the first time in my life.

I am over 50 now. I cannot go out of the island, learn a new skill and pick up another job. My son knew he cannot earn a living on this island. So, he left the island and has become a migrant day-wage labourer in south India and sends money to support our family.

Oceanographers and other experts came to the island and conducted studies five years ago. They said the water level around the island is rising and it will perhaps completely vanish underwater by 2050. But in the past five years, the island has been shrinking. I think Ghoramara will disappear underwater within 10 or 15 years.",2021-11-02 10:00:23
"The global death toll from Covid-19 is now about equal to the entire populations of Los Angeles and San Francisco combined, according to figures released from the Johns Hopkins University.

19 months after the pandemic was first declared it has been confirmed that at least five million people have died from the virus - though some experts, including those from the World Health Organization, believe the true toll may be two to three times higher than official figures suggest.

The US, Brazil, India, Mexico and the UK disproportionately account for more than half of all deaths worldwide.

The number of deaths from Covid-19 far outstrip that of other viral epidemics in the 21st century and most from the 20th century, with the notable exception of the Spanish flu - where the number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide.

The death toll as tallied by Johns Hopkins rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Globally, Covid-19 is the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.

Since it was first recorded in China in late 2019, the coronavirus spread quickly to almost every corner of the world and was declared a pandemic in March 2020. The virus has since mutated into more than a dozen new variants, including the highly infectious Delta strain.

In the last month, the US, UK, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine have recorded the most new cases, while 581m doses of vaccine have been administered worldwide. The US has the largest death toll, at 745,836, followed by India (458,437).

The majority of those dying of Covid-19 particularly in the UK and the US are have not been vaccinated.

"“This island is me, and I am this island,” Wadhuam Pabai Pabai (pictured on the left) says of the homeland he’s known all his life.

“I can’t imagine being forced to leave Boigu … there are 65,000 years of wealth and experience here,” the father of seven says. Losing Boigu, his home in the Torres Strait, will mean losing all of it.

He and fellow islander Wadhuam Paul Kabai (pictured on the right), are leading a class action on behalf of their island communities, arguing the commonwealth of Australia is acting unlawfully in failing to stop climate change that, if unchecked, will destroy their homelands.

They are drawing inspiration - if not direct precedent – from a case from the Netherlands know as the Urgenda case. This is where 886 plaintiffs argued the Dutch government had an obligation to protect its citizens from the impacts of climate change. That case, challenged all the way to the country’s supreme court by the government, succeeded at every level.

The result was a dramatic shift in Dutch government policy – including the closure of coal-fired power stations, billions of euros of investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and binding commitments towards emissions reductions. Similar cases have followed in Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Germany, France, New Zealand, and elsewhere.

But the Urgenda decision relied significantly on the European Convention on Human Rights – particularly articles two and eight, safeguarding the rights to life, and to a private and family life. That law does not apply to Australia, but lawyers will argue the commonwealth of Australia has a legal “duty of care” towards Torres Strait Islander peoples, arising both from negligence law and the Torres Strait Treaty and Native Title.

Lego is touting it as its most ambitious build to date, but rather than many pages of instructions, the toymaker’s handbook offers only 10 steps ...

The booklet is not for a physical model though. Instead, the new mock up of a Lego instruction manual, offers “building instructions for a better world”. It was put together based on research and workshops conducted with more than 6,000 young people from around the world.

Nearly half of the children told researchers they thought about the environment once a week, while one in 10 thought about it every day. Global heating was their No 1 concern.

The handbooks will be handed out to delegates at the crucial Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow this week - with Tim Brooks, the vice-president of environmental responsibility at Lego, saying the initiative sought to “give children a voice” at the climate talks.“

Brooks added that feedback from youngsters had spurred Lego’s action on single-use plastic, which will be removed from its sets by 2025, as well as work on recycled bricks.

"What do you think of Facebook's new name: Meta?

The announcement by Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg that the social media giant will change the name of its holding company to Meta in a virtual-reality rebrand has prompted dismay and bemusement.

The rebrand comes as the company faces a series of public relations crises. A trove of recently leaked documents now known as the Facebook Papers exposed the inner workings of the company, with allegations from whistleblower Frances Haugen that Facebook has put profits ahead of ridding its platform of hate speech and misinformation.

Politicians across all party lines also joined the conversation about the controversial rebrand. New York progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez didn’t hold back in her disapproval, calling the company “a cancer to democracy” and “a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society.”

US Senator Richard Blumenthal alleged the name change was nothing more than an effort to “confuse” and “distract” but ultimately “won’t erase years of devious practices & disregard for privacy, kids’ wellbeing, spreading hate, & genocide.”

Twitter also jumped on board with the official Twitter account joking they had “big news” followed by the clarification – “lol jk still twitter”.

Zuckerberg revealed the new name at Facebook’s annual AR/VR conference on Thursday, where he outlined the company’s virtual-reality vision for the future. He said Meta would encompass Facebook as well as apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp and the virtual reality brand Oculus.

“Announcing Meta — the Facebook company’s new name,” the tech giant said in a tweet. “Meta is helping to build the metaverse, a place where we’ll play and connect in 3D. Welcome to the next chapter of social connection.”

Jessica Stern, the US special diplomatic envoy for LGBTQ rights, called the moves historic and celebratory, adding that they brought the government documents in line with the “lived reality” that there is a wider spectrum of human sex characteristics than is reflected in the previous two designations.

Dana Zzyym, an intersex Colorado resident who has been in a legal battle with the department since 2015, said their passport is the first US passport to be issued with an ""X"" gender designation.

Zzyym (pronounced Zimm) was denied a passport for failing to check male or female on an application. According to court documents, Zzyym wrote “intersex” above the boxes marked “M” and “F” and requested an “X” gender marker instead.

Zzyym served in the navy as a male but later came to identify as intersex while working and studying at Colorado State University.

The department’s initial denial prevented Zzyym from traveling to a meeting of Organization Intersex International in Mexico.

The state department announced in June that it was moving toward adding a third gender marker for non-binary, intersex and gender-nonconforming people but said it would take time.

A department official said the full passport application and system update with the “X” designation option still need to be approved by the Office of Management and Budget.

The department now also allows applicants to self-select their gender, no longer requiring medical certification if their gender did not match that listed on their other identification documents.

The United States joins a handful of countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Nepal and Canada, in allowing its citizens to designate a gender other than male or female on their passports.

"Going for a night out with friends is meant to be among our most carefree and happy times, but for many young women, that experience is now rife with anxiety.

The phenomenon of “spiking” – where a stranger drugs your drink, leaving you incapacitated and unable to remember what happened to you – has been known for many years, frequently as a grim prelude to sexual assault.

But a recent spate of reports in university towns in the UK has left a new generation of students worried for their safety and angry that more is not done to ensure they are protected.

Sarah Buckle is a student at the University of Nottingham and believes she was spiked by injection while out clubbing with friends during Freshers' week.

Medics told her that she showed signs of having been spiked. It was then that she noticed a small pinprick on her hand, which was bruised and throbbing.

Here's her story.

"“One of the worst pages in the history of the Italian republic.""

That's how Pina Picierno, a Democratic party member of the European parliament, described Italy's senate decision to vote down an anti-homophobic violence bill.

The senate has killed off a bill that would have made violence against LGBT people and disabled people, as well as misogyny, a hate crime.

The 315-member senate voted by 154 to 131 on Wednesday to block the debate on the law, named after the gay centre-left Democratic party (PD) legislator Alessandro Zan. It was previously approved by the lower house of parliament in the face of months of protests from far-right and Catholic groups.

According to the far-right parties that voted against the bill in the upper house, the law would have suppressed freedom of expression and promoted “homosexual propaganda” in schools.

Last June, the Vatican made an unprecedented intervention urging the Italian government to change the law over concerns it would infringe upon the Catholic church’s “freedom of thought”.

Debate over the approval of the bill, which would lead to people convicted of such crimes being jailed for up to four years and permit an increase in funding for groups that work to fight against discrimination and assist people who are the victims of it, came after a series of high-profile attacks against gay and transgender people.

Rights groups receive hundreds of hate crime reports each year but many go unpunished. Although Italy approved same-sex civil unions in 2016, the country has lagged behind its EU partners in creating anti-homophobia measures.

Attempts by various governments over the past three decades to enact a similar law have either been stifled or sabotaged, with any progress or even just meaningful debate stymied by a macho culture, Catholicism and support for far-right parties.

"“They’re not these mindless killers, but we just happen to look like their food.""

New research by Australian scientists has supported the theory that great white sharks do not actively seek out humans as prey.

The study says that on the rare occasion the apex predator attacks a human, the bite may be the result of mistaken identity, because they may not be able to visually distinguish surfers and swimmers at the water’s surface from their natural prey.

The team @macquarieuni compared video footage of swimmers, people paddling surfboards, and seals from the perspective of a great white shark viewing from below in the water.

Taking into account what a shark is likely to see when looking up at a person or seal against the background skylight, the researchers concluded that neither the silhouette shape nor motion cues were enough for a shark to clearly tell them apart.

Great whites are thought to be more successful in hunting prey at the water’s surface. Sharks are also thought to be colour blind, or to have only limited ability to perceive colours at best.

“Their acuity, or their ability to see detail, is much lower than ours,” the study’s lead author, Dr Laura Ryan said. “They’re not these mindless killers, but we just happen to look like their food.""

Ryan said more research was needed into other species involved in shark bites, such as bull shark and tiger sharks. “We’re not sure if mistaken identity applies to them. Seals aren’t a common prey item for them but they do consume things like turtles … and things floating at the surface.”

"What, or who, do you think is to blame for the climate crisis?

A majority of Americans want to see oil and gas companies held to account for lying about the climate crisis and contributing to global heating, according to a new YouGov poll commissioned by the @guardian_us, @vicenews, and @coveringclimate.

The survey reveals that the US remains sharply divided over the causes of the deepening environmental emergency following the fossil fuel industry’s long campaign to downplay and deny climate science.

The poll surveyed 1,000 American adults and found that 70% said global warming was happening. More than 60% said oil and gas companies were “completely or mostly responsible”.

But Democrats and Republicans at odds over the source of climate disinformation. While Democrats overwhelmingly (89%) accept the scientific basis of the climate emergency, opinion is split among Republicans. Just 42% of Republicans agreed that global warming is a reality while 36% denied it. The remainder said they didn’t know.

Political division also emerges again when people were asked about the specifics of the fossil fuel industry’s misdeeds.

Democrats said oil and gas companies lied about the existence of climate change, and their part in creating it, at more than three times the rate of Republicans. Just under half of Republicans said oil and gas companies had done nothing wrong.

But one of the clearest divisions remains over scientific opinion on the climate crisis.

While 68% of Democrats said that most scientists think global warming is human-caused, just 22% of Republicans agreed. Half of Republicans said there is “a lot of disagreement” on the issue among scientists, a position held by less than 15% of Democrats.

"The offspring of hippos once owned by Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar can be recognized as people or “interested persons” with legal rights in the US following a federal court order.

The case involves a lawsuit against the Colombian government over whether to kill or sterilize the hippos, whose numbers are growing at a fast pace and pose a threat to biodiversity.

The so-called “cocaine hippos” – pictured above – are descendants of animals that Escobar illegally imported to his Colombian ranch in the 1980s when he reigned over the country’s drug trade.

After his death in a 1993 shootout with authorities, the hippos were abandoned at the estate and left to thrive, with no natural predators. Their numbers have increased in the last eight years from 35 to somewhere between 65 and 80.

A group of scientists has warned that the hippos pose a threat to the area’s biodiversity and could lead to deadly encounters with humans. They are advocating for some of the animals to be killed. A government agency has started sterilizing some of the hippos, but there is a debate on what are the safest methods.

An animal rights groups is hailing the order as a milestone victory in the longstanding efforts to sway the US justice system to grant animals personhood status.

But the order, granted by federal magistrate judge Karen Litkovitz in Cincinnati, will not carry any weight in Colombia where the hippos live, a legal expert said.

Christopher Berry, the lead attorney for the Animal Legal Defense Fund, called it a narrow but profound ruling.

“This really is part of a bigger movement of advocating that animals’ interest be represented in court,” he said. “We’re not asking to make up a new law. We’re just asking that animals have the ability to enforce the rights that have already been given to them.”

"Despite facing racism throughout his career, Wilston Samuel Jackson dedicated his life to railway. He has now been honoured at a ceremony in London.

The picture above shows his great-grandchildren Josiah, Lawrence and Sofia beneath the new blue plaque commemorating him as Britain’s first black train driver.

Speaking at the event yesterday, his daughter, Polly Jackson, said: “He was never late or missed a day, and he was so proud of his work, despite the many challenges he faced. Today was a fitting tribute to his life and career.”

Born in Jamaica, Jackson – who died in 2018 at the age of 91 – began maintaining trains shortly after moving to London in 1952 as part of the Windrush generation.

He went on to become a driver a decade later and had a long and successful career on the railway, including driving the famous Flying Scotsman locomotive and The Elizabethan.

Known as Bill, Jackson worked his way from a maintenance role to a position managing train boilers, which saw him spend the day shovelling coal in hot and filthy conditions. He would then return home to study for his driver exams.

His journey to becoming a train driver came at a time when many black people had their applications blocked due to racism, and Jackson’s appointment in 1962 sparked a furious reaction from some of his white colleagues, who unsuccessfully attempted to prevent white men from working under him.

Two years later, Jackson broke both his legs when his train crashed into the back of a stationary goods train near Finsbury Park after a signalman mistakenly gave a green light. After his recovery he returned to the railway, before later emigrating to Zambia where he taught people how to drive trains.

Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers’ union, Aslef, said: “We are incredibly proud to have had Wilston as one of our own, a dedicated driver with an illustrious and groundbreaking career.”

Recent figures from Aslef revealed that only 10% of Britain’s train drivers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.

"Japan’s Princess Mako has lost her royal status after marrying her “commoner” college sweetheart, Kei Komuro – a man she described as “irreplaceable”.

After years of criticism of their relationship that has left Mako, who is Emperor Naruhito’s niece, struggling with her mental health, the couple announced at a press conference at a hotel in Tokyo yesterday that they had wed. 

Mako and Komuro, who met at university almost a decade ago, were originally due to marry in 2018 but postponed after Japanese media revealed that Komuro’s mother was embroiled in a minor financial scandal.

The couple, who did not have a formal wedding ceremony or hold a reception banquet or any of the traditional rites associated with imperial weddings, said they paid for yesterday's press conference venue themselves, amid accusations on social media that they should not “waste” taxpayers’ money.

Her father, Crown Prince Akishino, had reportedly opposed a traditional royal wedding after acknowledging that the Japanese public were divided over their marriage in light of reports that Komuro’s mother had failed to repay a loan of ¥4m (£25,387), although there have been claims that the money was a gift.

The couple have inevitably invited comparisons with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle owing to the media onslaught and their decision to move to the US.

Japan’s male-only succession laws mean Mako, who gained a master’s degree from Leicester University, can never be a reigning empress. If she has a son he will be raised as a non-royal and will not ascend the Chrysanthemum throne.

Her departure from the palace has highlighted the dearth of heirs to the throne, while pressure to reform the succession laws has failed to gain traction under successive conservative governments. 

Mako’s father is first in line, followed by her younger brother, Prince Hisahito. If Hisahito does not have a male child, the line of succession will be broken.

"“Retreat is not an option”.

Sudan’s military has launched a coup, arresting leading politicians and declaring a state of emergency, as thousands of protesters who flooded the streets of Khartoum in opposition reportedly faced gunfire.

Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who headed Sudan’s power-sharing sovereign council, justified the seizure of power by saying infighting between the military and civilian parties threatened the country’s stability.

Footage shared online appeared to show protesters blocking streets and setting fire to tires in the capital and its twin city of Omdurman, as security forces used teargas to disperse them.

Protesters could be heard chanting: “The people are stronger, stronger,” and: “Retreat is not an option!” as plumes of smoke filled the air. The internet has been cut and key bridges closed.

Sudan has been on edge since a failed coup plot last month unleashed recriminations between military and civilian groups who have been sharing power following the toppling of the autocrat Omar al-Bashir two years ago.

Members of a disparate alliance including warlords, military, militia leaders and former Bashir regime loyalists have been calling for the restoration of military rule, while several cabinet ministers took part last week in big protests in Khartoum and other cities against the prospect.

The prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, was detained overnight and moved to an undisclosed location after refusing to issue a statement in support of the coup, said the information ministry, which was still apparently under the control of Hamdok’s supporters.

Images posted on social media appeared to show large crowds marching on Khartoum’s Africa Street, which runs from near the international airport towards the city centre, with the sound of gunfire audible in some videos. Initial reports suggest at least a dozen people had been injured.

The US, which has been mediating in Sudan, condemned the arrests and threatened to withhold assistance, and domestic opponents of the military opposition called for nationwide protests and a general strike.

"“The world knew him as Gunther … but Michael’s loved ones knew him as an actor, musician, cancer-awareness advocate, and loving husband.""

James Michael Tyler has died at the age of 59.

Tyler, most famous for playing Gunther, the manager of Central Perk in the hit sitcom Friends, announced in June that he had stage 4 prostate cancer, which was diagnosed in 2018.

His family statement continued, saying: “Michael loved live music, cheering on his Clemson Tigers, and would often find himself in fun and unplanned adventures. If you met him once you made a friend for life.”

Friends co stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox have also paid tribute to their co-star. “Friends would not have been the same without you. Thank you for the laughter you brought to the show and to all of our lives. You will be so missed,” Aniston, who played Gunther’s unrequited love interest on the show, said in an Instagram post.

Cox followed shortly after, writing: “The size of gratitude you brought into the room and showed every day on set is the size of the gratitude I hold for having known you. Rest In peace James.”

In May, Tyler had appeared on Friends: The Reunion but was unable to attend in person due to his health issues. Appearing instead via Zoom, he said: “It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly.

“I could not have imagined just a better experience. All these guys were fantastic and just a joy to work with. It felt very, very special.”

Tyler said he didn’t reveal his illness before then because: “I didn’t want it to be like ‘Oh, and by the way, Gunther has cancer’.”

Tributes have poured in across social media, with some remembering the actor as the “seventh friend” due to his regular presence on the hit show.

Kevin Bright, former executive producer of Friends, tweeted: “James Michael Tyler Our Gunther passed away last night. He was an incredible person who spent his final days helping others. God bless you James, Gunther lives forever.”

"Tommie Smith still gets chills when he hears the opening bars of The Star Spangled Banner.

It takes him right back to that night in October 1968 when he stood on the Olympic podium in Mexico City, wearing his gold medal, and made the raised-fist salute that has defined his life.

“Because that’s the first three notes I heard in Mexico, then my head went down, and I saw no more of it until the last note.” While the anthem played, all that was going through Smith’s head, he says, was “prayer and pain”.

Pain because he had picked up a thigh injury that day on the way to winning the 200m final (he still set a world record).

And prayer because Smith was not just putting his career on the line – he was risking his life.

There was a real possibility that somebody in the stadium might try to shoot him or his team-mate John Carlos, who was making the salute beside him after winning bronze.

"Halyna Hutchins was a talented and passionate cinematographer who was clearly enjoying her job as director of photography on Alec Baldwin’s latest cowboy movie, Rust. 

The 42-year-old died on the set of the film yesterday after Baldwin - an actor and producer of the film - fired a prop gun in an accident that also injured its director, authorities have said.

Over the past three weeks, Hutchins posted photos on her Instagram account from the film’s rugged set in the foothills of New Mexico. They included vivid sunsets and a cast and crew picture in which Hutchins is standing next to Baldwin against the backdrop a log cabin.

There is also a short video clip taken on Wednesday in which Hutchins – wearing a grey scarf and wide-brimmed hat – sets off on horseback with colleagues. “One of the perks of shooting a western is you get to ride horses on your day off,” she wrote.

Born in Ukraine in 1979 when the country was part of the Soviet Union, Hutchins’ journey from the USSR to Hollywood was an improbable one. She grew up on a military base in the Arctic Circle surrounded by reindeer and nuclear submarines. An “army brat”, she said she got interested in film because “there wasn’t that much to do outside”.

Hutchins started her career as a reporter after studying international journalism at Kyiv National University. She worked on several British film productions in eastern Europe, travelling to remote locations, and saw how the cinematographer worked.

“I was fascinated with storytelling based on real characters,” she said. A self-confessed adrenaline junkie, Hutchins documented her forays into extreme sports including parachuting and cave exploration. A decade or so ago, she decided to concentrate on film-making full-time and moved to California.

According to American Cinematographer, Hutchins took whatever production jobs she could find. She also dabbled in fashion photography to learn more about what she called the “aesthetics of lighting – how you create the mood, the feeling”.

"Can our bodies withstand global heating?

Between 1998 and 2017, more than 166,000 people died due to heat, according to the World Health Organization, and countries around the world are experiencing a year on year rise in record-breaking high temperatures.

For many people, unendurable heat is becoming the new normal. It is most likely to disproportionately affect the poor, the sick – those with chronic conditions, or heart and kidney disease in particular – and older people.

Each organ responds differently to extreme heat exposure, with symptoms that quickly become fatal or cause lingering damage from which the body may never fully recover.

We spoke to Mike McGeehin, environmental health epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr Pieter Vancamp, post-doctoral researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, Dr Richard Johnson, professor of medicine and head of renal diseases and hypertension at the University of Colorado and Dr Edward Walter, a consultant and anaesthetist at the Royal Surrey county hospital about the impact of extreme heat on our bodies.

The number of sculptures that feature animals, almost 100, is double that of named women. Just 1% of sculptures are dedicated to named people of colour; 0.9% are men of colour and 0.2% are named women of colour

The study, part of a national research project by Art UK funded in part by City Hall, is the first comprehensive audit of public sculpture and monuments across the capital.

The alleged thief unknowingly broadcast his face to more than 20,000 people who were watching the livestream at the time, as he left the scene smoking a cigarette. Clips of the incident were later widely shared on social media, including here.

"A sunfish estimated to weigh up to 2,000kg (4,410lb) has been found tangled in tuna fishing nets in the Mediterranean.

The gigantic animal was measured at 3.2 metres long and 2.9 metres wide, a record find for Ceuta, a Spanish autonomous city on the north coast of Africa. It was so heavy a big a crane was needed to winch it aboard a ship during rescue efforts - and it almost broke a 1,000kg scale. 

The fish's extraction from and return to the water went smoothly, to the relief of both fishermen and scientists - including marine biologist, Enrique Ostalé, who says he had heard of sunfish this size only in books.

"Latvia has announced a month-long coronavirus lockdown after an unprecedented surge in infections.

The Baltic country becomes the first country in Europe to reimpose far-reaching restrictions as countries across the continent suffer a new wave of cases.

Latvia was for a long time viewed as one of Europe’s lone coronavirus success stories, recording fewer than 3,000 Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic.

Now it has one of the highest rates of new Covid cases per capita in the world, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Critics say a sluggish and uneven vaccination rate has led to the rise in infections.

Romania and Ukraine have also recorded a surge of new infections and Covid deaths as the countries struggle to convince their populations to get vaccinated.

And with colder weather and few restrictions, the virus also looks to be regaining strength in heavily vaccinated countries such as the UK and the Netherlands.

"Could this be the significant step in the long quest to one day use animal organs for life-saving transplants?

In a major scientific advance, surgeons at a New York hospital have attached a pig’s kidney to a human and watched it begin to work - it filtered waste and produced urine – and for the first time ever did not trigger a rejection.

The researchers kept a deceased woman’s body going on a ventilator after her family agreed to the experiment, feeling that ""there was a possibility that some good could come from this gift.""

Pigs have been the most recent research focus to address the organ shortage, but a sugar in their cells, which is foreign to the human body, causes immediate organ rejection.

The kidney for this experiment came from a gene-edited animal, engineered to eliminate that sugar and avoid an immune system attack.

Several biotech companies are in the running to develop suitable pig organs for transplant to help ease the human organ shortage.

More than 90,000 people in the US are in line for a kidney transplant. Every day, 12 people die while waiting.

But for many people raising pigs to be organ donors feels morally wrong, though it may grow more acceptable if concerns about animal welfare can be addressed, says Karen Maschke, a research scholar at the Hastings Center. “The other issue is going to be: Should we be doing this just because we can?” Maschke said.

"A terrorist bombing has targeted a passing army bus in the Syrian capital killing at least 14 people, the Sana state news agency has reported.

The attack is the deadliest in Damascus since a bombing targeted the Justice Palace in March 2017, killing at least 30 people. The city had been largely spared such violence in recent years, especially since troops and allied militia retook the last significant rebel bastion near the city in 2018.

No group has yet claimed responsibility for today's attack, but moments later shelling by government forces struck the war-ravaged town of Ariha in Idlib, a region controlled by groups that have claimed to have carried out such bombings in the past.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rockets struck a busy area at the time children were heading to school. Three children were among those killed, the Britain-based war monitoring group said.

The Damascus bombing will challenge the Syrian regime's assertion that the decade-old war is over and stability guaranteed for reconstruction efforts and investment projects to begin in earnest.

"A 3.5m-tall puppet child refugee has nearly completed her 8,000km journey across Europe to highlight the hostility experienced by refugees who have been travelling the same route from the Syrian border to the UK for years.

The unaccompanied nine-year-old Syrian girl searching for her mother - the character of Amal (which means hope in Arabic) - was developed from a play created by the refugee theatre company Good Chance.

The goal of her epic trek was to make thousands of people along the route to reflect on their attitudes towards refugees, particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced children forced to flee their homes because of conflict over the past decade.

Little Amal started 'The Walk' in the Turkish city of Gaziantep in July and will end in Manchester, England in early November. Today, she was greeted by a group of schoolchildren, alongside British actor Jude Law, on Folkestone Pier after crossing the Channel.

Things haven't always gone smoothly along the way. In Greece, far-right protesters threw things at her as she walked through the streets and local councillors voted to ban her from visiting a village of Orthodox monasteries. In France, the mayor of Calais raised objections to her presence.

But there have been bright spots on her journey too. As she started the walk in Gaziantep, at the Turkish border with Syria, refugee children made lanterns to welcome her. In Italy, the puppet went to the Vatican and shook hands with the Pope, while thousands of children in Brussels wrote letters to her, in an effort to make them to think about the experience of being a child refugee.

As she crossed the Channel to the UK on Tuesday for the final stage of her journey, producer David Lan said; “If I was to say to you we had nothing but warmth and support along the 8,000km journey, it would not be true.""

“But what Little Amal seems to do is take the experience of people who are quite brutally marginalised and put it in the centre. This is about goodwill. It is an opportunity for people to be sympathetic and imagine what it would be like to be her.”

"From orangutans swinging through psychedelic forests, to deer roaming saturated canyons - artist Jim Naughten hopes to draw attention to nature's rapid disappearance and our growing estrangement with it.

For his latest exhibition, he has combined photography and painting to create images of the natural world as a faraway fictional fantasy.

Naughten drew inspiration from dioramas of animal forms found in natural history museums all over the world, before digitally reimagining them in defamiliarised and unrealistic contexts.

His digital painting technique is closely linked to magic realism, in which the boundary between fact and fiction, imagination and reality, becomes blurred through the intersection of mediums.

""I’m interested in how, in the evolutionary blink of an eye, humans have come to dominate and overwhelm the planet and how far our relationship with the natural world has fundamentally and dangerously shifted from that of our ancestors.""

""I hope the work will create awareness and discourse about this disconnection, our fictionalised ideas about nature and possibilities for positive change.""

"As an increasing number of countries, businesses and individuals mark World Menopause Day today, UK lawmaker Carolyn Harris says she is ready to shame whoever stands in the way of progress.

The Labour MP is pushing a private member’s bill on menopause, which is due to be heard later this month, to demand free prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy in England – which is already available in Scotland and Wales. Harris says she has cross-party support from dozens of MPs.

Menopause campaigners argue that medical sexism and a lack of training means many women are left to suffer the symptoms of menopause – which can include depression, anxiety, insomnia and brain fog as well as hot flushes.

In the UK, there are more than 13 million currently experiencing menopause or perimenopause (meaning around menopause) - and it is estimated the nation could be losing 14m work days a year related to the menopause. The recent research also concluded that one in four women who experience menopausal symptoms – many at the top of their career – consider leaving their job.

Many more businesses are joining the menopause revolution though, says Harris – pointing to companies such as Cult Beauty which has introduced comprehensive policies around miscarriage, IVF, pregnancy and the menopause. But it’s not enough to have a policy, she adds. “This can’t be a box-ticking exercise, companies and the government really have to genuinely want to help these workers.”

Harris’s own experience with the menopause was brutal. Twenty years after losing her eight-year-old son in a road traffic accident she blamed herself for not processing her grief when she was hit by a deep depression. “It took me six years, having conversations with women, for me to realise I was going through the menopause,” she says.

Now she wants to use her voice in parliament to speak up for those who she says are often just too tired to fight. “There’s a hell of a lot of women my age working and they are exhausted,” she says. “A lot of those women are going through the menopause but they are not being treated, because there is still not enough understanding about a condition that affects 51% of the population.”",2021-10-18 18:59:04
"Colin Powell, the first Black US secretary of state, has died at the age of 84 from complications from Covid-19.

In a statement on Facebook, his family said: We have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American."" They also said that Powell was fully vaccinated and thanked the medical staff at Walter Reed National Medical Center for their ""caring treatment"".

Powell, who was wounded in Vietnam, rose to occupy the top military position in the US government as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff between 1989 and 1993, but it was in the build up to the contentious invasion of Iraq that Powell became a household name.

He was the face of the Bush administration’s aggressive attempt to get the world community to back the invasion, based on false claims of Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction. 

Powell stepped down as secretary of state in November 2004, following Bush’s re-election. He later insisted to reporters that he had tried to warn Bush of the consequences of invading Iraq, but had supported the president when the decision to proceed was taken.

In a statement on Monday, Bush called Powell “a great public servant… He was such a favorite of Presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom – twice. He was highly respected at home and abroad.”

Powell considered a bid to become the first Black president in 1996 but his wife Alma's worries about his safety helped him decide otherwise.

And after his time in government, Powell remained a hugely influential commentator on US politics and public life. Over the years he grew increasingly distanced from his own Republican party, disillusioned by its rightward drift. 

In 2008, despite party rivalries, he endorsed Barack Obama for president. When Donald Trump launched his bid for the White House, Powell became one of his leading critics.

"This charcoal and pencil drawing of Isaac Kyoyeta, an events manager in Kampala, is the work of Martin Senkubuge - a Ugandan artist who is challenging the stigma surrounding the skin condition vitiligo.

Through his portraits, Senkubuge aims to make people with the condition ""proud of their skin"" rather than ""cursed"", which he says is the way many people in the region are made to feel.

“People said that persons with vitiligo were cursed and bewitched,” says Senkubuge. “There was a lot of myths and misinformation surrounding them, which was unfair.”

The 22-year-old started reaching out to contacts who knew people who had the skin condition via social media, proposing to draw their pictures. It wasn’t easy.

“I got about 60 contacts, but only three showed up for the photoshoot,” he recalls. But he would not give up. He encouraged those three models to try to persuade others to participate in his campaign.

“I told them my intentions,” says Senkubuge. “I wanted them to pose, stand tall, and be proud of who they are. I told them that art is beautiful and that healing begins from within.”

An estimated 1% of the global population have vitiligo, which isn’t contagious and can be hereditary, caused by an autoimmune disease or trigged by a stressful event, severe skin damage or exposure to certain chemicals. But it gets little attention, largely because it is regarded as a cosmetic condition rather than life-threatening.

People with vitiligo are “already beautiful”, Senkubuge says. “We just want them to believe it.” He now plans to take his pictures, and the campaign, across east Africa.

"Jacky Wright, the London-born corporate vice-president and chief digital officer at Microsoft US, was given this year’s top spot on 14 October by the Powerlist 2022, the annual list of the UK’s most powerful people of African, African-Caribbean and African American heritage.

Marcus Rashford, the footballer and campaigner, came in second place while Anne Mensah, vice-president of Content UK at Netflix, was third. The Oscar-winning actor Daniel Kaluuya is a new entrant to the list, in fourth.

Steven Bartlett, 29, founder and former CEO of Social Chain and the newly named youngest ever panellist on the BBC show Dragons’ Den, is another new entrant.

Wright welcomed the accolade but said the UK had a long way to go before it could call itself an equal society. “I am proud to be in the company of these great leaders of African and African-Caribbean heritage, but I am reminded that we still have a very long way to go,” she said.

“Each of us has a responsibility to ensure that we not only showcase role models, so future generations can envision who and what they can be but, more importantly, we need to make monumental shifts to create a more equitable society.”

Wright was selected by a panel of judges led by the retired high court judge Dame Linda Dobbs, who said Wright took the top spot for the “sheer scale of the work she is doing”.

As one of the most senior black leaders in the civil service, and HMRC’s disability champion, Wright campaigned for diversity in government, including race and disability.

The Powerlist was launched in 2007 to showcase black role models across industries including business, science, technology and the arts. Entrants are judged on their “ability to change lives and alter events, as demonstrated over a protracted period of time and in a positive manner”.

"“We’re running out of time, the clock is ticking,"" said Anna Staneva, the interim head of conservation at BirdLife Europe and Central Asia, after Europe's latest ""red list"" report revealed that one in five bird species on the continent are now at risk of extinction.

Birds that have been the cornerstones of our ecosystems - including
the common swift, common snipe and rook - are among species disappearing, while the Pallas’s sandgrouse, common buttonquail and pine bunting (pictured above) have all become regionally extinct.

A species is regionally extinct if it has not been observed in Europe over a minimum period of five years.

The BirdLife International analysis, which is based on observations of 544 native bird species, report that 30% of species assessed are showing population decline, according to observations from thousands of experts and volunteers working in 54 countries and territories.

However, it is not all bad news. The recovery of the bittern, Azores bullfinch and griffon vulture show targeted action on species recovery can work. Certain raptors such as red kites are doing better thanks to the banning of pesticides such as DDT and legal protection against persecution.

The latest list will help inform on-the-ground conservation action and national and international environment policies.

Recommendations from the report include creating a larger and better managed network of protected areas, consistent with the UN target of protecting 30% of land by 2030, with substantial areas under strict protection, such as “no take” marine protected areas and “no logging” forests.

Fifty major cities, mostly in Asia, and at least one large nation on every continent but Australia and Antarctica are at risk. Many small island nations are threatened with near total loss of their land - taking with them the heritage and history of these coastal communities.

Meeting the most ambitious goals of the Paris climate agreement could reduce the sea level rise exposure by roughly half. But the world is not on course to limiting global warming to 1.5C (2.7F), as outlined in the 2015 Paris agreement.

"It has taken her 12 years, 450 hours and at least 1.5m strokes, but the Chloë McCardel has become the queen of the Channel by swimming the stretch of water between England and France for the 44th time.

“I’m so thankful,"" said the 36-year-old Australian after breaking the record. “So many people helped along the way to make my dreams come true and hopefully I can inspire the next generation of open water swimmers and young people to go after their dreams.”

Last year she surpassed the men’s world record of 34 crossings and this week she passed the record of 43 crossings held by British swimmer Alison Streeter. It’s been a hell of a journey. She has suffered from hypothermia and battled boredom, pain and jellyfish. Whatever the experience, the stretch of water kept calling her back. “The first time I really felt like I’d found where I belonged,” she says. “Like my whole life has been heading to this one point.

I call it my spiritual home.”

McCardel hopes her feats of endurance, skill and grit will inspire other women. She speaks openly about being a survivor of domestic violence, and credits swimming with helping her begin to recover from PTSD. “After going through so much trauma, swimming the Channel helped rebuild my confidence, which was shaken a lot. My sense of identity and my sense of self worth was shaken.""

He said it would be an “absolute disaster” if his eldest son, Prince George, was having to talk about the same issue in 30 years when it would be too late - and warned world leaders against “clever words but not enough action”.

William added that his viewpoint had changed since he had kids: “I want the things that I’ve enjoyed – the outdoor life, nature, the environment – I want that to be there for my children, and not just my children but everyone else’s children.

"England faces more floods and droughts, rising sea levels and greater demand on water supplies due to the climate crisis, the Environment Agency has warned.

Ahead of the UN Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow, the government agency is warning that adaptation – becoming resilient to the already inevitable effects of climate change – is just as important as actions to cut greenhouse gases.

It is a case of “adapt or die”, said the Environment Agency’s chair, Emma Howard Boyd, warning that deadly events such as the flooding in Germany this summer would hit the UK if the country did not make itself resilient to the more violent weather the climate emergency was bringing.

In a report to the government, the EA said global heating would exacerbate the pressure on England’s water environment, which is suffering from problems such as pollution and increased demand, and make it harder to ensure clean and plentiful water.

There will be more and worse environmental incidents, such as flooding, water shortages and pollution; regulation is not ready for climate change; and the natural world cannot adapt as fast as the climate is changing, the EA said.

The report notes that population growth and climate change will increase water demands and mean that, if no further action is taken between 2025 and 2050, more than 3.4bn extra litres of water a day will be needed for resilient public water supplies.

The Environment Agency said it was working with government, businesses and communities on flood protection and with watchdog Ofwat on water supplies. It said it was focusing on restoring and creating peatlands, wetlands and other habitats to create resilient places for wildlife, reduce the risk of flooding, improve water quality and boost access to green spaces for people.

Since taking back control, girls have effectively been banned from secondary education in Afghanistan, with high schools to re-open only for boys. Women in refuge shelters have been sent home to their abusers or to prison and public executions have once again become the norm in a sign of Afghanistan’s new rulers’ return to their harsh version of Islamic justice.

"""Everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes.""

DC Comics has confirmed that the new iteration of Superman, Jonathan Kent, is bisexual.

In the new comic, the traditionally heterosexual superhero will embark on a same-sex relationship with a friend, Jay Nakamura, a reporter who cares for him after he “mentally and physically burns out from trying to save everyone that he can”.

Kent, who is the son of Clark Kent and Lois Lane, started his tenure in July.

“The idea of replacing Clark Kent with another straight white savior felt like a missed opportunity,” Tom Taylor, the series writer, said in an interview with the New York Times.

“I’ve always said everyone needs heroes and everyone deserves to see themselves in their heroes and I’m very grateful DC and Warner Bros share this idea"".

The news follows other recent attempts to add queerness to the world of comics. In August, it was announced that the latest version of Robin would have a boyfriend - while in March, Marvel also made the decision to pass the mantle of Captain America to a gay character.

Kent’s sexuality is not the only way in which Superman has been updated for a new audience and time.

Recent issues have seen the character protesting against the deportation of refugees, stopping a high school shooting and trying to put out wildfires that were the cause of the climate crisis.

Attention now turns to the big-screen worlds of Marvel and DC which remains less progressive than the comics.

This November’s Eternals is set to change things with the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first LGBTQ+ kiss between Brian Tyree Henry’s Phastos, the first openly gay superhero in a Marvel movie, and Haaz Sleiman, who plays his husband.

"We can't even begin to imagine how uncomfortable this was ...

Wildlife officials in Colorado say an elusive elk that wandered the hills with a car tyre around its neck for at least two years has at last been freed.

The four-and-a-half-year-old - 270kg (600lb) - bull elk was spotted near Pine Junction, south-west of Denver, on Saturday evening and tranquillised, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife.

Officers with the agency had to cut off the elk’s five-point antlers to remove the object because they couldn’t slice through the steel in the bead of the tyre.

“We would have preferred to cut the tyre and leave the antlers for his rutting activity, but the situation was dynamic and we had to just get the tyre off in any way possible,” officer Scott Murdoch said.

Authorities explained that the rutting season - when a male elk looks to mate with female elk - played a role in helping officers find him.

Murdoch said: “The rut definitely made him more visible. There was a bigger bull in the group he was with on Saturday, but he is getting to be a decent size bull.”

Wildlife officers first spotted the elk in July 2019 while conducting a population survey for Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep and mountain goats in the Mount Evans Wilderness. It has since spent the past couple of years travelling back and forth between Park and Jefferson counties.

They estimate that the elk was freed of about 16kg (35lb) in weight, and were surprised to see its neck was in good condition after two years of chafing.

“The hair was rubbed off a little bit, there was one small open wound maybe the size of a nickel or quarter, but other than that it looked really good,” Murdoch said. “I was actually quite shocked to see how good it looked.”

In the past, the officer have seen deer, elk, moose, bears and other wildlife have become entangled in a number of items, including swing sets, hammocks, clotheslines, decorative or holiday lighting, furniture, tomato cages, chicken feeders, laundry baskets, soccer goals and volleyball nets.

"You may have been hearing the word 'blackfishing' more and more recently. The definition above is how journalist Wanna Thompson - who is credited with coining the term - described it to CNN.

'Blackfishing' rose to prominence in 2018 when Thompson said she noticed white celebrities and influencers 'cosplaying as black women'.

“It’s always been prevalent,” Thompson says. “Be it fashion, beauty or music. Black is cool, unless you’re actually black.”

The word has been appearing a lot in headlines at the moment in connection with former Little Mix band member Jesy Nelson. She has frequently faced accusations of blackfishing, altering her hair, lips and skin tone to appear racially ambiguous, and singing in a blaccent.

In response to the latest claims, during an Instagram Live with rapper Nicki Minaj, to promote their new single Boyz, Nelson said she never intended to cause offence and wanted to celebrate the music she loves and has grown up with.

Minaj also defended the former Little Mix star saying: ""Y'all gotta stop."" She added on Twitter: ""If you know someone has been suicidal from bullying in the past, why try to get a bunch of people to bully them again about something else?""

Nelson is not the first star to be called out for allegedly 'blackfishing', people like Kim Kardashian, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez, and Bhad Bhabie have all faced accusations of pretending to be black or mixed-race.

“It’s about picking and choosing common black traits and characteristics for one’s benefit,” explains Johanna Yaovi, the founder of The Curl Talk Project, “while we continue to face discrimination on a day to day basis.

“As black women, we are constantly fighting for clear, authentic representation and diversity and then have to face individuals who do blackfishing, individuals who will therefore look ambiguous enough for brands to use them as emblems for diversity.""

"""Expect us.""

Hundreds of protesters led by Indigenous activists from across the country demonstrated in front of the White House yesterday to demand that Joe Biden stop approving fossil fuel projects and declare the climate crisis a national emergency.

The rally marks the start of five days of demonstrations calling for greater attention to climate injustices as Native American leaders and tribal members head to the capital to publicize their demands.

Outside the White House, the words “Expect Us” were spray-painted on the base of a statue of Andrew Jackson, the seventh US president who is infamous for, among other things, leading the violent and lethal repression of Native American peoples in a displacement known as the Trail of Tears.

“Expect Us” is part of the phrase “Respect Us, or Expect Us,” which many Indigenous women have been using while demonstrating against the Canadian oil company Enbridge’s $9bn upgrade of an oil pipeline designed to carry oil from Alberta, Canada, to Wisconsin.

The Indigenous Environmental Network – a broad alliance of tribes, Indigenous rights groups, labor organizations and others – have criticized Biden for not moving to block Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement project.

IEN said they'd had ""enough of Biden's empty words"" and urged him to swiftly ""mitigate the climate chaos that has engulfed our communities.”

Monday’s demonstrations fell on a federal holiday in the US that until recently was officially dedicated to Christopher Columbus. However, spurred by national calls for racial equity and decolonization, communities across the country have over the years paired or replaced it with Indigenous Peoples’ Day.

The demonstration was mostly peaceful, although protesters were subjected to police use of a long-range acoustic device, which emits a piercing sound, according to video footage captured by Indigenous campaigners. There were also a few arrests.

"71% of boys feared they teased if they played with what they described as “girls’ toys”, according to a new survey by Lego.

It has prompted the world's largest toymaker to confirm it will remove gender stereotypes from its products.

The company surveyed almost 7,000 parents and children aged six to 14 from China, the Czech Republic, Japan, Poland, Russia, UK and the US.

It found attitudes to play and future careers remain unequal and restrictive.

The survey showed that, while girls were becoming more confident and keen to engage in a wide range of activities, almost third quarters of boys who took part feared they would be made fun of if they played with what they described as “girls’ toys” – a fear shared by their parents.

The study found that parents still encouraged sons to do sports or Stem activities, while daughters were offered dance and dressing up (girls were five times more likely to be encouraged in these activities than boys) or baking (three times more likely to be encouraged).

Madeline Di Nonno, the chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, who conducted the research, said this showed behaviours associated with men are valued more highly in society; ""Until societies recognise that behaviours and activities typically associated with women are as valuable or important, parents and children will be tentative to embrace them.”

The Danish toymaker said it no longer labels any of its products “for girls” or “for boys” and customers can no longer search for products by gender online. Instead, the Lego website offers themes that it calls “passion points”.

"Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been accused of showing “contempt for the dignity of vulnerable women” by vetoing a plan to distribute free sanitary pads and tampons to disadvantaged girls and women.

The plan was expected to benefit 5.6 million women, including homeless people, prisoners and teenage girls at state schools. It is estimated period poverty keeps one in four girls out of school in the country.

Tabata Amaral, of the Democratic Labour party (PDT) and one of 34 cross-party federal deputies who co-authored the bill, slammed the decision; “Bolsonaro says this project is ‘against the public interest’ – I say that what is against the public interest is that girls lose around six weeks of school a year because they are menstruating.""

In May, a report by the UN children’s fund, Unicef, and population fund, UNFPA, found that 713,000 girls in Brazil live without access to a bathroom; about 4 million girls don’t have adequate hygiene facilities at school, such as sanitary pads and soap, and at least 200,000 girls lack even the minimum hygiene facilities at school, such as bathrooms.

"“The news that unvaccinated pregnant women now make up nearly 20% of England’s most critically ill Covid patients is a damning indictment of the lack of attention given to this vulnerable group as restrictions have eased,"" said Sarah McMullen, director of impact and engagement at parenting charity NCT, in response to new figures.

One in six patients requiring the NHS’s highest form of life-saving care are unvaccinated pregnant women with Covid.

Twenty of the 118 patients with Covid who received extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo) between July and September were mothers-to-be, NHS England said. Of these, 19 had not had a jab and the other had only had one dose of a vaccine.

NHS England released the statistics as part of a renewed effort to persuade pregnant women to get fully vaccinated amid new evidence from doctors in Israel that Covid can cause serious problems for the mother-to-be and her baby in the later stages of pregnancy.

The new data also underline extra risks facing unvaccinated people. Of the 118 men and women who had Ecmo in those three months, 107 had not been jabbed, four had only had one dose and only seven were fully immunised.

“This is another stark reminder that the Covid-19 jab can keep you, your baby and your loved ones safe and out of hospital,” said Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, NHS England’s chief midwifery officer.

Experts in pregnancy and women’s health, NHS leaders and ministers have been concerned at the number of mothers-to-be who have not been immunised, amid unfounded fears – partly fuelled by anti-vax campaigners – that getting jabbed could harm the mother, her baby or both.

This comes as new peer-reviewed evidence published on Monday showed that pregnant women with Covid-19 are more likely to suffer from gestational diabetes, lower white blood cell counts and heavier breathing during and after birth.

The disease can also increase the risk of newborns struggling to breathe, according to the study of 2,471 women by Dr Elior Eliasiof the Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Israel. “Our findings support the importance of vaccinating all pregnant women at all stages of pregnancy,” he said.

"Have you reduced how much meat you eat?

Britons have cut their meat consumption by 17% over the past decade but will need to double these efforts if they are to meet targets for healthy diets and sustainable food production set out earlier this year.

Meat production is a major contributor to global heating and land degradation, while eating lots of red and processed meat has been linked to a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.

For these reasons, the government-commissioned national food strategy for England recently recommended that people try to cut their meat consumption by about 30% within the next decade.

To understand how much meat people in the UK are currently eating, Cristina Stewart, a health behaviours researcher at the University of Oxford, and colleagues turned to dietary data recorded in the National Diet and Nutrition Survey. This annual exercise involves asking a nationally representative sample of the population to keep a food diary for four consecutive days.

The analysis found that between 2008-9 and 2018-19 participants’ average meat consumption decreased from about 103g per person a day to 86g, a reduction of about 17g or 17%. This is equivalent to eating roughly two and a half fewer pork sausages each week.

There was an absolute reduction of 13.7g of red meat and 7g processed meat, and a 3.2g increase in white meat consumption.

Stewart said: “I think the reductions that we’re seeing are positive, but we’re moving pretty slowly, and if we continue reducing our intake at the same rate, we’re not really going to be reaching these dietary targets.”

Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the British Heart Foundation, said: “We need to look beyond meat to benefit from the full range of protein sources available to us. Including plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, nuts and seeds, or using these to bulk out meat dishes can be a healthy way to cut down on the amount of red and processed meat you are eating.”

"The 2021 Nobel peace price has been awarded to two journalists and free speech activists: Maria Ressa from the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov from Russia.

Maria Ressa is a Filipino-American journalist and author, the co-founder and CEO of Rappler who spent nearly two decades as an investigative reporter in southeast Asia for CNN .

In 2020, she was convicted of cyberlibel under a controversial Philippine law against cybercrime, a move widely condemned by rights groups and journalists as an attack on press freedom.

The Guardian published this editorial about Ressa last year, calling her a “courageous journalist” and her conviction a move “designed to chill the media”.

Dmitry Muratov is a Russian journalist and one of the founders of the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, described by the Committee to Protect Journalists as “the only truly critical newspaper with national influence in Russia today”.

Muratov won an International Press Freedom Award in 2007 for his courage in defending press freedom in the face of attacks, threats and imprisonment.

Announcing the award, the Nobel committee chair, Berit Reiss-Andersen, said: ""Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda. Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time.""

"Pope Francis has said he is “shamed” by the Catholic church’s failure to deal with paedophile priests in France.

A landmark report on Tuesday found that at least 330,000 children were sexually abused by clergy and lay members of church institutions in France over the past 70 years.

The pope conceded that the church had failed to put the needs of victims first in what was considered to be one of his strongest condemnations of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church to date.

“There is, unfortunately, a considerable number,” he said during his weekly audience at the Vatican on Wednesday. “I would like to express to the victims my sadness and pain for the trauma that they suffered. It is also my shame, our shame, for the incapacity of the church for too long to put them at the centre of its concerns.”

The independent inquiry was France’s first major reckoning with clerical child sexual abuse. It found an estimated 216,000 children were victims of sexual violence by French Catholic priests, deacons and other clergy from 1950 to 2020. When considering lay members of the church, such as teachers at Catholic schools, the figure rose to at least 330,000.

In the wake of the damning findings, Hans Zollner, a German priest and close adviser to Pope Francis, urged Italian bishops to “find the courage to investigate” clerical child abuse.

“The Catholic church in other countries must now find the same courage as in France. I hope in Italy too,” Zollner said in an interview with La Repubblica.

In January 2019, a UN commission condemned Italy for being complicit in protecting paedophile priests from criminal charges and called for the country to devise a national plan to prevent the sexual abuse of children.

“The numbers in France are frightening but here we could have up to 1 million victims. Simply hearing ‘I’m sorry’ is laughable,"" said Francesco Zanardi, who set up Rete l’Abuso, Italy’s only network of clerical abuse victims.

"""What’s sad is that a lot of cases aren’t taken too seriously. It’s just another Black girl,” said Jennifer Redmond, whose 19-year-old daughter Sarayah Jade was killed last September.

To families of victims and local activists, the release of new data on the number of Black women and girls who were murdered per day in the US last year, is just the latest reminder that violence against them often goes ignored – and that it should be made a more urgent public priority.

According to statistics released by the FBI last week, at least four Black women and girls were murdered per day in 2020, a sharp increase compared with the year before.

The FBI recorded at least 405 additional murders of Black women and girls last year as homicide surged across the country, and experts caution that even that stark number probably represents an undercount.

The increase in murders of Black women comes as the overall US murder rate rose nearly 30% during the pandemic, the biggest jump in six decades.

The rising murder rate has affected Black women across the country. Baltimore, Maryland, recorded the highest-ever number of women killed in 2020, with at least 48 women murdered throughout the year, many of them Black.

Advocates and experts said the stark rise makes it clear it’s time to address the factors that have long made Black women face a three times higher homicide rate than white women, as well as why their risk of being murdered increased sharply last year.

“Black women and girls have been indoctrinated to believe everyone matters but themselves,” said Rosa Page, the founder of the advocacy group Black Femicide US.

When things “get rough, Black women are the first to be harmed”, said Ori Monroe, an organiser with Black Femicide US and co-founder of Black Women Lead/Black Femme Fund.

"It's being hailed as a 'breakthrough for science'.

The World Health Organization has recommended the widespread rollout of the first malaria vaccine, in a move experts hope could save tens of thousands of children’s lives each year across Africa.

Calling it “an historic day”, the WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that after a successful pilot programme in three African countries the RTS,S vaccine should be made available more widely.

The RTS,S vaccine, also known as Mosquirix, was developed by the British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and has been administered to more than 800,000 children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi since the pilot programme began in 2019.

“Using this vaccine in addition to existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year,” said Tedros on Wednesday. “It is safe. It significantly reduces life-threatening, severe malaria, and we estimate it to be highly cost-effective.”

He added: “Malaria has been with us for millennia, and the dream of a malaria vaccine has been a long-held, but unattainable dream. Today, the RTS,S malaria vaccine, more than 30 years in the making, changes the course of public health history. We still have a very long road to travel. But this is a long stride down that road.”

Noting the role played by GSK in the development of the RTS,S vaccine, Gareth Jenkins, director of advocacy at the charity Malaria No More, called on the UK government to continue to invest in cutting-edge research that could “finally bring about a zero-malaria world”.

There have been fears that decades of progress towards ending malaria has stalled, with some countries, such as Eritrea and Sudan, seeing significant resurgences in recent years. In 2019, 409,000 people died from the mosquito-borne parasite disease, most of them in Africa. More than 270,000 of the victims were children under five.

Experts hope the WHO’s announcement will re-energise the race to find other vaccines, a quest that has been going on for almost a century.

"How many toys names do you think your pet can remember?

Our dogs might follow commands such as “sit”, or become uncontrollably excited at the mention of the word “walkies”, but when it comes to recalling the names of their toys and other everyday items, most seem pretty absent-minded.

Now a study of six “genius dogs” has advanced our understanding of dogs’ memories, suggesting some of them possess a remarkable grasp of the human language.

Hungarian researchers spent more than two years scouring the globe for dogs who could recognise the names of their various toys.

Although most can learn commands to some degree, learning the names of items appears to be a very different task, with most dogs unable to master this skill.

Max (Hungary), Gaia (Brazil), Nalani (Netherlands), Squall (US), Whisky (Norway), and Rico (Spain) made the cut after proving they knew the names of more than 28 toys, with some knowing more than 100.

They were then enlisted to take part in a series of livestreamed experiments known as the Genius Dog Challenge.

All of the dogs taking part were border collies – herding dogs originally bred to work sheep. Although this makes many of them very responsive to the behaviour of their owners, only a small proportion of the breed are able to memorise the names of their toys.

Neither is this talent unique to border collies. “Thanks to the Genius Dog Challenge we have managed until now to find also dogs from other breeds including a German shepherd, a pekingese, a mini Australian shepherd and a few dogs of mixed breeds,” said researcher Dr Shany Dror from the Eötvös Loránd University. Separate research has also suggested some Yorkshire terriers may be able to do it.

“Dogs are good models for studying human behaviour as they evolved and develop in the human environment,” said one of the study’s co-authors, Prof Ádám Miklósi at Eötvös Loránd University. “With these talented dogs we have a unique opportunity to study how another species understands the human language, and how learning words influences the way we think about the world.”

"What do these sculptures make you think of?

They form the first permanent artwork to honour the Windrush generation in the UK and were unveiled in the east London borough of Hackney on Friday to mark the first day of Black History Month.

The artist, Veronica Ryan, pictured on the second slide, created three sculptures in bronze and marble of Caribbean fruits; Custard Apple (Annonaceae), Breadfruit (Moraceae) and Soursop (Annonaceae).

Ryan says the use of these fruits ties into the narrative of migration and movement; “I grew up in the 1950s. My parents moved between London and Watford. I remember some of the complexities my parents had during the 1950s. I remembered my mum and some of her friends discovering Ridley Road market, and my mother bought fabrics and threads. I remembered some of the fruits and vegetables.”

She hopes the artwork will foster a sense of ownership amongst the local community and provide a vital public space to celebrate their cultural heritage.

“I’m hoping that the community will recognise themselves through my choices. Through breadfruit, soursop, a custard apple, that the community will say: ‘Oh my goodness, oh I know those. Those are things we grew on trees back home,’” she said.

Carole Williams, the lead member for the council’s response to the Windrush scandal, described the permanent artwork as “another step on the road to doing the work that we committed to do as a council when we passed the comprehensive Windrush motion back in 2018, which was the first of its kind in the country”.

The motion has two strands: policy work that calls for an end to the hostile environment policies, challenging the impact it continues to have on the Windrush generation and their descendants; and celebrating and honouring the community.

"Dominic Raab has rejected the idea that misogyny should become a hate crime in the wake of Sarah Everard's murder, but then appeared confused about its meaning as he suggested it could apply to abuse against either women or men.

The justice secretary and deputy PM, who has said he is not a feminist and previously complained about the “raw deal” men are getting, said it was his “number one priority to make sure women feel confident in the justice system”.

Pressed on BBC Breakfast about whether misogyny should be a hate crime, Raab appeared not to understand the term as he said “misogyny is absolutely wrong, whether it’s a man against a woman or a woman against a man”. Misogyny is hatred aimed specifically against women, and some campaigners would like to see it criminalised.

Questioned about his confusion, Raab said: “What I meant was, if we are talking about things below the level of public order offences of harassment, intimidation, which are rightly criminalised – if we are talking about, effectively, insults with a sexist basis, I don’t think that criminalising those sorts of things will deal with the problem that we have got at the heart of the Sarah Everard case.”

He said the problem was with enforcement, rather than a lack of laws, supporting Boris Johnson’s views that a hate crime of misogyny was not necessary.

"An estimated 126,000 gallons of crude oil has leaked from an underwater pipeline near Los Angeles in one of the largest disasters in recent state history.

The spill near Huntington Beach – which is equal to the volume of around 3,000 full bath tubs – has created a miles-wide sheen in the ocean and washed ashore, threatening the coastal ecosystem and marine wildlife.

The spillage, suspected to have originated in a 17.5-mile pipeline located 80-100ft beneath the surface off the Orange county coast, created a miles-wide sheen in the ocean and washed ashore in sticky, black globules.

Crews have been working feverishly to stop the spread of the oil and clean up the area. The Huntington Beach mayor, Kim Carr, said the beaches of the community nicknamed “Surf City” could remain closed for weeks or even months.

"“Sickle cell disease has defined me, defined my body and made a big dent to my dreams ... No matter how hard I fight, it continues to defeat me. A new treatment brings hope and might make dreaming possible again.”

That's what Toks Odesanmi, a finance specialist and patient at Cambridge University hospitals trust, said after the NHS announced that thousands of people in England are to benefit from the first new therapy for two decades for the serious and lifelong health condition.

Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder - particularly common in people with an African or Caribbean background - characterised by red blood cells that assume an abnormal, rigid, curved shape, resembling a sickle. It can cause severe pain and organ failure, often requiring hospital admissions.

Crizanlizumab, a “revolutionary” life-changing drug treatment, is delivered by a transfusion drip and works by binding to a protein in the blood cells to prevent the restriction of blood and oxygen supply. The therapy will help at least 5,000 people over the next three years, officials said.

Current treatments to prevent sickle cell crises include a tablet called hydroxycarbamide and regular blood transfusions, but these are not always effective for people with severe forms of the disease.

“This revolutionary treatment will help to save lives, allow patients to have a better quality of life and reduce trips to A&E by almost half,” said Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England.

"A former Facebook employee has accused the company of putting profit over the public good, after coming forward as the whistleblower who leaked a cache of internal documents that have placed the tech firm in its worst crisis since the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Frances Haugen - who is due to testify in Congress today - came forward on Sunday as the whistleblower behind a series of damaging reports in the Wall Street Journal that have heaped further political pressure on the tech giant. Haugen told the news program 60 Minutes that Facebook’s priority was making money over doing what was good for the public.

She has been called to testify before the US Senate’s commerce subcommittee on the risks the company’s products pose to children. Lawmakers called the hearing in response to a Wall Street Journal story based on Haugen’s documents that showed Facebook was aware of the damage its Instagram app was causing to teen mental health and wellbeing.

Haugen will argue that Facebook’s closed design means it has no oversight, even from its own oversight board, a regulatory group that was formed in 2020 to make decisions independent of Facebook’s corporate leadership. She also alleges that Facebook's decision to prematurely reinstate old algorithms, valuing engagement above all else, contributed to the 6 January attack on the Capitol building.

“As soon as the election was over, they turned them back off or they changed the settings back to what they were before, to prioritise growth over safety. And that really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me,” she said.

"These are the 81 women in the UK allegedly killed in circumstances where the suspect is a man since the murder of Sarah Everard.

Her kidnap, rape, and murder in London by Met police officer Wayne Couzens has sparked a new wave of anger and fear about male violence against women.

As the details of Everard's case unfolded, women's sense of despair and anger heightened.

The hope that her murder would bring about rapid change all but evaporated. On 18 September, nearly seven months after the 33-year-old was killed, a member of the public found the body of the schoolteacher Sabina Nessa in Cator Park in south-east London.

In addition to Nessa, another 80 women were killed by men in 28 weeks in the UK, according to Karen Ingala Smith of the Counting Dead Women project. That brings the total for 2021 to at least 109, which she is sure is an underestimate,

“After Sarah was killed there was a big outcry and people said it felt like a sea change, but I just I can’t see it like that,” she said.

“In between Sarah and Sabina, there were so many women killed, and we don’t have a huge outpouring of anger and empathy and grief for every one. As a society we seem to find these deaths as somehow acceptable.”

She noted that whilst sentencing Wayne Couzens, Lord Justice Fulford had called Everard “a wholly blameless victim”, implying other women killed at the hands of men may not be so blameless.

Murders by strangers attract much greater attention than stories of women killed by someone they know, although they are significantly less common.

Those deaths are just a fraction of the violent incidents faced by women in the UK. The last year saw a global and national increase in domestic violence, and an increase in rape reports, whilst the number of prosecutions has collapsed.

"Thousands of women across the US joined nationwide protests against the Texas abortion law, demanding continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy.

Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court, shouting “My body, my choice” and cheering loudly to the beat of drums.

It's the first Women's March since Joe Biden became president. The day before the march, his administration urged a federal judge to block the nation’s most restrictive abortion law, which has banned most abortions in Texas since early September.

It is one of a series of cases that will give the nation’s divided high court occasion to uphold or overrule Roe v Wade.

The abortion-themed demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term for the supreme court that will decide the future of abortion rights in the US, after appointments of justices by Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court.

The Women’s March has become a regular event, although interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, since millions of women demonstrated in the US and around the world the day after Trump’s inauguration in January 2017.

Trump endorsed punishing women for getting abortions and made appointment of conservative judges a mission of his presidency.

"This portrait is of Moody. He was living in his broken down truck in Las Vegas in 2017 when this picture was taken.

The image is part of a new social documentary photography project aiming to authentically capture homeless communities in America.

Inspired by her own experience living outside, Thilde Jensen's pictures document the stories of those living on the streets from Nevada to New York.

After becoming friends with two homeless people who lived under a highway in Syracuse, New York in 2014, Jensen began her project, portraying homelessness as the social cost of a system valuing profit over human welfare.

Jensen herself spent two years living out of a tent in the woods after becoming sick. She had been living well and working hard but had not made enough money to cover health insurance and she had no American safety net to catch her.

""Most of the homeless people I met had life stories so full of trauma and neglect that I was surprised they had made it this far,"" Jensen said.

""An unkind world and a system not designed to help them succeed had deeply scarred many of them. They feel cast out, unwanted, invisible, forgotten.""

Jensen's exhibition - I AM NOT INVisible - is part of the inaugural @brsphotofest at the @martinparrfdn, Bristol, England until 19 December.

"For some, it is a source of shame – and a trigger for frequent mirror checks: is my hairline receding? Is there a thin patch on top of my head?

But for the acclaimed photographer Rankin and the conceptual artists Scott Kelly and Ben Polkinghorne, male baldness is something to celebrate.

Their 'Baldpieces' project, a series of portraits of men adorned with striking headwear, focuses on masculine beauty and challenges an enduring taboo.

Two-thirds of men begin to lose hair on their heads by the age of 35. By the age of 50, 85% of men will have significantly thinner hair.

Kelly and Polkinhorne made hundreds of sketches of male pattern baldness before whittling them down to eight shapes. They then collaborated with headpiece designers to create magnificent “crowns to adorn balding crowns”.

With Rankin’s involvement, they put out casting calls for balding men to be photographed. “Because of the stigma, we were amazed there were men willing to come forward,” said Kelly.

Rankin, a globally renowned portrait and fashion photographer whose subjects have included the Queen, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones and Madonna, said the headpieces were “brilliant in their originality”.

“There is a taboo around baldness – we don’t particularly talk to other men about it, apart from taking the mickey,” he said. This project was “trying to create something new, and say it’s OK to be bald. It’s so confronting – yet so unashamedly masculine.”

"What do you think governments should be doing to combat loneliness?

With its campaign 'One Against Loneliness', the Dutch government has encouraged organisations, businesses, and towns to find solutions to a growing number of people feeling lonely, particularly among the elderly.

The Netherlands has around 1.3m people over the age of 75, half of whom said they regularly feel lonely.

Enter 'Kletskassa' which translates to 'chat checkout'. The concept began a couple of years ago at the supermarket chain Jumbo.

Colette Cloosterman-van Eerd, CCO of Jumbo said: “Our stores are an important meeting place for many people and we want to play a role in identifying and reducing loneliness.

""We are proud that many of our cashiers like to take a seat behind a Kletskassa. They support the initiative and want to help people to make real contact with them out of genuine interest. It is a small gesture, but very valuable, especially in a world that is digitizing and getting faster and faster.”

"“The horned crocodile-faced hell heron” is one of two exciting new species of dinosaur to have been unearthed off the coast of England.

Found on the Isle of Wight, the 125 million-year-old predator, officially named Ceratosuchops inferodios, had a 9 metre-long body, powerful claws, a gigantic skull covered in horns and bumps, and long crocodile-like teeth.

The fearsome creature lived on the fringes of ancient floodplains where it would have lain in wait for aquatic prey, research suggests.

Scientists say the discovery, along with the skeleton of a second species at the same site, offers unique insights into how the Spinosauridae family of dinosaurs made the transition from land-dwelling to semi-aquatic predators over a period of tens of millions of years.

“This is a really exciting piece of news for the dinosaur world as these are some of the most charismatic and enigmatic predators,” said Neil Gostling of the University of Southampton, who supervised the project.

The new finds also cemented the Isle of Wight’s status as the best place in Europe to find dinosaurs, he added.

“The fact they have these crocodile-like teeth, which are good for catching slippery fish, means we suspect they were standing in the water and using their jaws to hunt,” said Gostling.

Another possibility is that the dinosaurs would have waited, semi-submerged, like a crocodile, or used their large claws to hook fish out of the water like a bear.

In bright sunshine on Wednesday, a choir from the school Betty Campbell led with distinction sang her favourite song, Something Inside So Strong, as a huge bronze monument to her was unveiled in a Cardiff city centre square.

Campbell was the first black woman to become a headteacher in Wales.

Under her leadership, Mount Stuart primary in Butetown, Cardiff, became a model for best practice in equality and multicultural education throughout the UK.

But the joyful unveiling was also important because the monument is the first statue of a real, named woman set up in an open-air public space in Wales.

Campbell’s daughter, Elaine Clarke, said her mother, who died in 2017 aged 82, would have been proud of the monument.

She recalled how as a child growing up in the Tiger Bay area of Cardiff, Campbell had been told that a black working-class woman could never reach the academic heights to which she aspired – but she had proved them wrong.

“This sculpture encapsulates Betty’s legacy of determination, aspiration and inspiration,” she said.

Campbell's family were present at the unveiling, including great granddaughter Ezrae Campbell, who can be seen sitting on the base of the statue on the last slide of this post.

Granddaughter, Michelle Campbell-Davies, said there were still too few teachers of colour and the education system was letting down students from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. But she called the statue a “beacon of hope.”

"Dismissed by some as 'a camera on wheels', Amazon's newest 'smart' home device has been announced.

Their home robot, named Astro, has a tablet display that show a couple of circle eyes, many sensors, and a camera.

Amazon said the robot can be remote-controlled when not at home to check on pets, or the stove. It can also automatically patrol the house and send owners a message if it detects anything out of the ordinary.

According to Vice, the robot tracks everything you do, relying heavily on facial recognition and monitoring user behaviour. However a source who worked on the robot told them that it is also heavily flawed.

""Astro is terrible and will almost certainly throw itself down a flight of stairs if presented the opportunity,"" they said.

To help soothe obvious privacy concerns around Astro, Amazon highlighted how owners can set up out-of-bounds areas and turn off cameras and mics, while LED lights and the screen show when someone is viewing the robot’s cameras, and it processes images and sensor data on the device.

The new robot will set you back $999 (£740).

The robot will ship later this year, Amazon said - but only in the US. And after the initial, limited run, the price will increase to $1,449.99.

"Does this statistic surprise you?

According to new study air pollution is likely to have been responsible for up to 6 million premature births and 3 million underweight babies worldwide every year.

The research, published in the journal Plos Medicine, is the first to calculate the total global burden of outdoor and indoor air pollution combined.

By looking at the results of multiple scientific studies, the study found that indoor air pollution exposure appears to carry a much higher burden compared to outdoor levels.

Indoor pollution, mostly from cooking stoves burning solid fuel such as coal or wood, made up almost two-thirds of the total pollution burden on pregnancies in 2019.

This is especially true in developing areas, such as in some parts of south-east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

More than 92% of the global population lives in areas where the outdoor air quality is below recommended limits set by the World Health Organization, and about 49% are exposed to equally high levels of indoor air pollution.

Regions such as south and east Asia are the most polluted, with Bangladesh, China, India and Pakistan home to 49 of the 50 of the most polluted cities worldwide.

In recent years wildfires, agricultural fires and dust storms have also caused extensive air pollution.

By minimising air pollution in south-east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the study calculated that the number of premature births and babies with low birth weight could be reduced by almost 78% globally.

"The ivory-billed woodpecker - pictured above - and 22 more birds, fish and other species are expected to be declared extinct by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

It’s a rare move for wildlife officials to give up hope on a plant or animal, but government scientists have exhausted efforts to find these 23 species and warned that the climate crisis, on top of other pressures, could make such disappearances more common.

“Each of these 23 species represents a permanent loss to our nation’s natural heritage and to global biodiversity,” Bridget Fahey, who oversees species classification for the Fish and Wildlife Service, told the New York Times. “It’s a sobering reminder that extinction is a consequence of human-caused environmental change,” he said.

The ivory-billed woodpecker was perhaps the best known species the US Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday will announce is extinct.

It went out stubbornly and with fanfare, making unconfirmed appearances in recent decades that ignited a frenzy of ultimately fruitless searches in the swamps of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida.

Around the globe, some 902 species have been documented as extinct.

The actual number is thought to be much higher because some are never formally identified, and many scientists warn the earth is in an “extinction crisis” with flora and fauna now disappearing at 1,000 times the historical rate.

The factors behind the disappearances vary – too much development, water pollution, logging, competition from invasive species, birds killed for feathers and animals captured by private collectors. In each case, humans were the ultimate cause.

But several scientists are staying positive, saying that it's possible one or more of the 23 species included in Wednesday’s announcement could reappear.

"The eating of dog meat has long been a traditional practice in South Korea, but has increasingly become an international embarrassment.

The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has now raised the idea of banning doing so in the country - where an estimated 1 million dogs are believed to be eaten annually.

Consumption has already been declining as more people embrace the animals as companions rather than livestock - and during a weekly meeting with the prime minister, Kim Boo-kyum, earlier this week, the president said the ‘time has come’ for the practice to end.

Moon, who has several canines at the presidential compound, including one dog he rescued after taking office, made his latest remarks as he was briefed on a plan to improve the care system for abandoned pets.

South Korea’s animal protection law is intended mainly to prevent the cruel slaughter of dogs and cats but does not ban consumption itself.

"Scientists have found what they called environmentally damaging levels of illegal drugs - including MDMA and cocaine - in the river running through Glastonbury festival owing to people peeing on the land instead of using the toilets and urinals on the site.

Researchers measured levels of illegal drugs in the river before, during and after the last Glastonbury festival, in 2019, comparing levels upstream and downstream of the event.

After the festival three years ago, drug levels in River Whitelake were high enough to harm aquatic wildlife, including a rare eel population, according to the report.

It found that the amount of MDMA was 104 times greater downstream than upstream in the weeks after the festival, rising to levels that could harm the life cycle of European eels, a protected species.

Cocaine concentration was 40 times higher downstream, although the levels of cocaine were not considered harmful to aquatic life.

Ahead of the 2019 festival, Glastonbury’s organisers launched a campaign, Don’t Pee on the Land, to raise awareness of the environmental damage caused by public urination on Worthy farm.

“Peeing on the land at Glastonbury causes pollution of the water table, which can affect local wildlife and fish,” they tweeted in June 2019. “The Environment Agency have the power to close the site if there is too much pollution. Please only pee in the hundreds of toilets and urinals on site.”

In response to the new research, Glastonbury’s spokesperson described public urination as “the biggest threat to our waterways and the wildlife for which they provide a habitat”.

"Greta Thunberg has slammed global leaders over their promises to address the climate emergency, dismissing them as “blah, blah, blah”.

In a speech to the Youth4Climate summit in Milan, Italy, today Thunberg quoted statements by UK prime minister, Boris Johnson: “This is not some expensive, politically correct, green act of bunny hugging”, and Narendra Modi: “Fighting climate change calls for innovation, cooperation and willpower” but said the science did not lie.

“Of course we need constructive dialogue,” said @gretathunberg. “But they’ve now had 30 years of blah, blah, blah and where has that led us? We can still turn this around – it is entirely possible. It will take immediate, drastic annual emission reductions. But not if things go on like today. Our leaders’ intentional lack of action is a betrayal toward all present and future generations.”

The Cop26 climate summit starts in Glasgow, UK, on 31 October and all the big-polluting countries must deliver tougher pledges to cut emissions to keep the goal of 1.5C within reach.

Carbon emissions are on track to rise by 16% by 2030, according to the UN, rather than fall by half, which is the cut needed to keep global heating under the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C.

Research published on Monday showed that children born today would experience many times more extreme heatwaves and other climate disasters over their lifetimes than their grandparents, even if countries fulfil their current emissions pledges.

Thunberg, @vanessanakate1 from Uganda, and hundreds of other young people from across the world are attending the Youth4Climate Summit. It is hosted by the Italian government, the UK’s partner in running Cop26.

Thunberg said: “They invite cherry-picked young people to meetings like this to pretend that they listen to us. But they clearly don’t listen to us. Our emissions are still rising. The science doesn’t lie.

“We can no longer let the people in power decide what is politically possible. We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive. Hope is not blah, blah, blah. Hope is telling the truth. Hope is taking action. And hope always comes from the people.”",2021-09-28 21:00:41
"What do you think of this statue?

The sculpture of a woman in a transparent dress from a 19th-century poem has sparked controversy in Italy.

The bronze statue was unveiled on Saturday in the town of Sapri during a ceremony attended by the former prime minister Giuseppe Conte, surrounded by a mostly male entourage.

The work by the sculptor Emanuele Stifano is a tribute to La Spigolatrice di Sapri (The Gleaner of Sapri), written by the poet Luigi Mercantini in 1857. The poem is based on the story of a failed expedition against the Kingdom of Naples by Carlo Pisacane, one of the first Italian socialist thinkers.

But a group of female politicians from the centre-left Democratic party have called for the statue to be knocked down. They argue it reflects nothing of the anti-Bourbon revolution nor the “self-determination of a woman who chooses not to go to work in order to take sides against the oppressor”.

Laura Boldrini, a deputy with the party, said the statue was an “offence to women and the history it should celebrate”.

Meanwhile, Stifano has defended his work in a Facebook post, saying it was “useless” to try to explain artwork to those “who absolutely only want to see depravity”.

"A jury has found the R&B superstar R Kelly guilty of being the ringleader of a decades-long racketeering and sex trafficking scheme that preyed upon Black women and children.

The disgraced singer was found guilty on all nine counts on Monday afternoon after decades of avoiding criminal responsibility for numerous allegations of misconduct, in a major #MeToo victory for Black women and girls.

The 54-year-old singer was accused of running a Chicago-based criminal enterprise that recruited women and children and subjected them to unwanted sex and mental torment.

Multiple witnesses said Kelly had forced them to obey perverse and brutal whims when they were underage in a scheme that stretched back more than two decades.

Gloria Allred, a lawyer for some of Kelly’s victims, said that of all the predators she’s gone after – a list including Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein – “Mr Kelly is the worst”.

“R Kelly thought that he could get away with all of this, but he didn’t,” Allred said outside the courthouse.

Kelly, perhaps best known for the 1996 smash hit I Believe I Can Fly, faces up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for 4 May. He denied any wrongdoing. Deveraux Cannick, a lawyer for Kelly, said he was “disappointed” by the verdict, adding that ""I’m sure we'll be appealing"".

"Breastfeeding could play an important role in helping to protect babies from Covid.

New research suggests that breastfeeding women, who have been infected with the virus, continue to produce virus-neutralising antibodies into their milk for up to 10 months.

It's believed these antibodies can be used to treat people with severe Covid, preventing their condition from getting worse.

Although young children are less at risk of developing severe Covid than older people or those with underlying health conditions, approximately one in 10 infants under the age of one will require significant hospital care if they become infected.

The antibodies in breast milk are somewhat different to the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that predominate in blood and are triggered by vaccination. The main antibody is Secretory Immunoglobulin A (IgA), which sticks to the lining of babies’ respiratory and intestinal tracts, helping to block viruses and bacteria from entering their bodies.

Although researchers had previously detected coronavirus antibodies in breast milk, it was unclear whether they could neutralise the virus, or how long women continue to produce them after encountering coronavirus.

Dr Rebecca Powell, who led the research in New York says; “This is the breastfeeding population, so knowing if there are antibodies in the milk, how long they’ll be protective after being infected, or which vaccine is going to give your baby the best antibody protection, is very important information, and will be relevant for a long time to come.""

"""A milestone for equality""

Swiss voters have decided by a clear margin to legalise marriage for same-sex couples in a referendum on Sunday - making it one of the last countries in Western Europe to do so.

Official results showed the measure passed with 64.1% of voters in favour and won a majority in all of Switzerland’s 26 cantons - the country's administrative provinces.

Switzerland’s parliament and the governing federal council supported the “Marriage for All” measure, and pre-referendum polls showed solid backing. The country has authorised same-sex civil partnerships since 2007.

Supporters said approval would put same-sex partners on an equal legal footing with heterosexual couples by allowing them to adopt children together and facilitating citizenship for same-sex spouses. It would also permit lesbian couples to use regulated sperm donation.

Amnesty International welcomed the move as a “milestone for equality”.

The Alpine nation, which has a population of 8.5 million, is traditionally conservative and only extended full voting rights to women in federal elections in 1971, with one canton holding out on full voting rights for municipal elections until 1990.

The latest same-sex referendum result is welcome news, but the topic does continue to divide the continent. Most countries in western Europe already recognise same-sex marriage, but most of those in central and Eastern Europe do not allow wedlock involving two men or two women.

Switzerland is the world’s 30th country to adopt same-sex marriages.

"So, these are some of the contenders in an annual competition to find China's ugliest buildings.

The “hall of shame” listing of China’s top 10 “ugliest” buildings has kicked off with 87 bizarre designs in the running, including a violin-shaped church and an Inner Mongolia hotel in the form of a monstrous babushka doll.

Over the past 11 years a Chinese architecture website, archcy.com, has been inviting people to vote in the lighthearted annual contest that it hopes will encourage people to ponder the flexible notion of beauty.

For years, China has been an experimental ground for ambitious domestic and international architects, with mixed results.

There is a national broadcaster building in Beijing, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, that is called “big pants” by Chinese social media users as it looks like a pair of legs (image three).

This year’s competition comes as the central government becomes more prescriptive about architecture. In April the national development and reform commission (NDRC) banned the construction of “ugly buildings”.

The official intervention triggered further curiosity among China’s internet users. On Weibo, the hashtag #BanningUglyArchitecture has been viewed 170m times. Users have also been sharing photos of what they consider “unattractive buildings” across the country.

"“With today’s action, [we] want to send two messages – that we don’t believe that rhino horns have any medicinal value and that we only believe in preserving the living rhinos.""

In aid of World Rhino Day, nearly 2,500 rare rhino horns that were confiscated by authorities were burned in public in Assam, India.

This is the first ceremony of its kind in northeastern India and is part of an anti-poaching drive.

Since the signing of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 1977, trade in rhino horn has been banned.

But there is still demand in China and Vietnam where it is sometimes promoted as a wonder ingredient in traditional medicine.

In South Africa alone, 769 rhinos were poached in 2018, and there have also been attempts to steal rhino horns from museums in Europe.

“A rhino horn has supreme value only when it is intact to the living rhino. These horns have no value,” Assam’s Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

Bokakhat, Assam is near the UNESCO-listed heritage site Kaziranga National Park, home to more than 2,000 one-horned rhinos – the world’s biggest population.

The collection of horns that were burned had been kept in storage by the government since 1969, some seized from poachers, and others removed from rhinos that died from natural causes.

"One of the founders of the Taliban and the chief enforcer of its harsh interpretation of Islamic law when they last ruled Afghanistan has said the hardline movement will once again carry out executions and amputations of hands, though perhaps not in public.

In an interview with Associated Press, Mullah Nooruddin Turabi dismissed outrage over the Taliban’s executions in the past, which sometimes took place in front of crowds at a stadium, and warned the world against interfering with Afghanistan’s new rulers.

“Everyone criticised us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments,” Turabi said in Kabul. “No one will tell us what our laws should be. We will follow Islam and we will make our laws on the Qur’an.”

Since the Taliban overran Kabul on 15 August and seized control of the country, Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will re-create their harsh rule of the late 1990s.

Turabi’s comments pointed to how the group’s leaders remain entrenched in a deeply conservative, hardline worldview, even if they are embracing technological changes, such as video and mobile phones.

Executions of convicted murderers were usually by a single shot to the head, carried out by the victim’s family, who had the option of accepting “blood money” and allowing the culprit to live.

For convicted thieves, the punishment was amputation of a hand. For those convicted of highway robbery, a hand and a foot were amputated.

Trials and convictions were rarely public and the judiciary was weighted in favor of Islamic clerics, whose knowledge of the law was limited to religious injunctions.

Turabi said that this time, judges – including women – would adjudicate cases, but the foundation of Afghanistan’s laws will be the Qur’an. He said the same punishments would be revived.

“Cutting off of hands is very necessary for security,” he said, saying it had a deterrent effect. He said the cabinet was studying whether to carry out punishments in public and will “develop a policy”.

"Strict coronavirus measures have made it difficult to be a taxi driver in Thailand.

But some of Bangkok's out-of-work drivers are making the most out of their taxis being left idle, by setting up mini vegetable gardens.

The 'taxi graveyard' has been set up to help feed drivers who are struggling to find fares.

The site is owned by Ratchapruk Taxi Garage, which has seen most of its drivers quit Bangkok for their home villages because fares have dried up following lockdown restrictions.

Thailand's Covid restrictions, to deal with a deadly spike in cases in recent months, include a night-time curfew and the tourism industry which the Bangkok's taxi trade heavily relies on has declined rapidly because of the country's strict arrival rules.

Vegetables being grown on the cars include eggplants, chillies, cucumbers, courgettes and basil. Any surplus crops will be sold at local markets.

"The evacuation of people on the Canary island of La Palma continues, as the ongoing volcanic eruption has pushed streams of lava towards inhabited coastal areas.

The eruption, which began on Sunday afternoon, has destroyed at least 183 homes and led to the evacuation of at least 6,000 people to date.

Fresh drone footage shows lava advancing down the volcano’s western flank towards the sea. Experts say that if and when the lava reaches the sea it could trigger more explosions and clouds of toxic gases.

Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, paid tribute to the “extraordinary work of the emergency workers” deployed on La Palma and said their efforts had kept people on the island safe.

But warnings to stay away from the magma and the volcano have not been universally heeded, with visitors flocking to catch a glimpse of the eruption.

No deaths or injuries have been reported, but the eruption is worrying banana farmers and grape growers in the region who fear their businesses will be affected.

"28-year-old teacher Sabina Nessa was found dead in London on her way to meet a friend at a local pub.

Her journey should have taken just over five minutes, and she is thought to have been murdered.

Her body was found near the OneSpace community centre at Kidbrooke Park Road in the Royal Borough of Greenwich on Saturday.

A man in his 40s who was arrested on suspicion of killing her has been released under further investigation.

The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said violence against women was a national “epidemic”. Appearing on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he said: “Between last year’s International Women’s Day and this year’s International Women’s Day, 180 women were killed at the hands of men across the country.

“We do have an epidemic when it comes to violence against women and girls. I think us men have got to be allies in addressing this issue.”

Colleagues and neighbours have paid tribute to Nessa. Her colleague Lisa Williams, the head of Rushey Green primary school in Lewisham, called her a brilliant teacher and said the school had been left “devastated”.

A vigil will be held at 7pm on Friday evening in Pegler Square for Nessa, supported by the group Reclaim These Streets, which organised a similar vigil after the murder of Sarah Everard in March.

Anna Birley, one of the group’s organiser’s, said Nessa’s death was more tragic evidence that urgent changes were needed.

“For too long the burden of women’s safety has been on women – it shouldn’t take yet another murder of a woman to change that,” she said. “Since March we’ve seen a lot of reports and little action – a woman dies at the hands of a man every three days in this country so the time for reports and platitudes is over and the time for action is long overdue.”

"A man named Serbest Salih is behind an unique project in Turkey, where children, most of them refugees, have been given analogue cameras and taught the art of photography.

He is one of an estimated 100,000 refugees living in the historic city of Mardin in south-eastern Turkey, just a few miles from the Syrian border.

And his life changed dramatically in 2017 when he discovered a sprawling refugee community living in a group of abandoned government buildings in the working-class Kurdish district of Istayson.

""It was a place where Turkish and Syrian Kurds lived as neighbours, but did not communicate. They were strangers who spoke the same language. It was at that moment I thought to use analogue photography as a means to integrate the different communities.""

Salih studied photography at college in Aleppo, before fleeing Syria with his family in 2014 as Islamic State fighters advanced on his home town of Kobani.

Children from the age of seven come to his workshops to learn the traditional skills of shooting on film and processing the results in a darkroom.

The results as a new book, i saw the air fly, shows are often surprising.
Rather than reflect the traumas of their displacement, the pictures tend towards the innocent and joyous: family portraits, blurred shots of their friends at play, children jumping, hiding, posing with their friends or tending their animals.

""When they start using them, something magical happens. They start to show the world they live in through their own eyes.""

""People think that if you give a refugee child a camera, the results will be sad, but instead most of these photographs are all about joy. They are small moments of private happiness.""

South America’s super-rich have long used them to hop between luxury beach properties, ranches and heavily guarded compounds.

But now, the skies over Latin America’s largest city are set to witness a futuristic aerospace revolution after the Brazilian budget airline Gol struck a deal that could see it ferry commuters around São Paulo in hundreds of low-cost zero-emission electric air taxis.

"“It is designed for people who have difficulty in finding a comfortable space to work in their home and don’t want to get in the way of their family,” the creators of this minimalist office said.

Japanese design is renowned for its minimalism, and for keeping things simple and uncluttered.

So it’s no surprise that a leading housebuilder is trying to tackle the lack of space for pandemic-era working from home by marketing a tiny home-office building that can be constructed adjacent to houses in just two days, weather permitting.

The so-called Hanare Zen is a 91cm-wide and 1.8 metre-long building equipped with power sockets, a counter-type desk and very little else.

KI Star Real Estate, a popular housebuilder, began taking orders for the Hanare Zen on 6 September, hoping to find a market among those struggling to work in cramped homes.

Hanare means separate or detached in Japanese, while Zenzen is written in both the Chinese character for Zen Buddhism and the alphabet.

“We had already created the Hanare building as a kind of storage space, and with the situation in the pandemic, the idea came about to develop the Hanare Zen as a work space,” said Chisa Uchiyama, a spokesperson for KI Star Real Estate. “The use of ‘Zen’ in the name represents the minimalist concept of stripping down the size and features to only what is necessary.""

The Hanare Zen will cost you 547,800 yen (£3,600) and is available in Tokyo and the surrounding areas.

For some of the 70% of Tokyo’s population that live in apartments, and would be unable to use a construction like the Hanare Zen, working in their cars has become one way to find some peace and quiet to toil in.

Demand is up for a range of accessories to support in-vehicle working, including stands for computers that fit onto steering wheels, folding desks, mini-fans, portable batteries and screens for windows to block outside distractions.

Mencap described him as “a brilliant role model”.

Webster, who is from Leeds, previously appeared in an educational video for the BBC’s Bitesize strand on misconceptions around the genetic condition.

CBeebies, aimed at children under seven, has been praised for its diverse content in recent years. 

Reactions to Webster’s appointment contrasts with the reception some 12 years ago to then-Cbeebies presenter Cerrie Burnell, born with her lower right arm missing, and whose appearance on the channel in 2009 led to a barrage of complaints.

Burnell Tweeted the news about Webster’s appointment, with the words “absolute joy”, as well as retweeting another message which posited that perhaps “the world has turned” in the intervening years.

"107 years and 300 days old makes sisters Umeno Sumiyama and Koume Kodama the oldest ever identical twins the world has seen.

They were born on November 5, 1913 on Shodo Island in Japan, and were the third and fourth siblings of a family with 11 children.

According to the Guinness World Records, the pair were separated as children and rarely met up until they reached 70.

Living about 190 miles apart, they saw one another mostly at weddings and funerals. But when they turned 70, they reconnected and started making Buddhist pilgrimages together.

Previous record holders Kin and Gin, also from Japan, had held the title of oldest identical twins at 107 years and 175 days since Kin's death in January 2000. Gin died the following year, aged 108.

Sumiyama and Kodama are now living in separate care homes, and their families said the twins are sociable and positive, and that they often joked about surpassing the age of Kin Narita and Gin Kanie.

Because of Covid measures, their world record certificates were mailed to their nursing homes, and Sumiyama reportedly was in tears when she received hers, while Kodama's memory has faded and she couldn't fully understand the significance of it.

Japan has one of the highest life expectancy in the world of 84.67 years. The oldest living person on record was 118-year-old Japanese woman Kane Tanaka.

"The US has reached a grim coronavirus milestone.

Covid-19 has now killed as many Americans as the 1918-19 flu pandemic – more than 675,000.

The US population a century ago was just one-third of what it is today, meaning the flu cut a much bigger, more lethal swath through the country.

But the Covid-19 crisis is by any measure a colossal tragedy in its own right, especially given the incredible advances in scientific knowledge since then and the failure to take maximum advantage of the vaccines available this time.

“Big pockets of American society – and, worse, their leaders – have thrown this away,” said Dr Howard Markel a medical historian at the University of Michigan.

While the Delta variant-fueled surge in infections may have peaked, US deaths are more than 1,900 a day on average – the highest level since early March – and the country’s overall toll topped 675,000 Monday, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University, though the real number is believed to be higher.

Winter may bring a new surge, with the University of Washington’s influential model projecting an additional 100,000 or so Americans will die of Covid-19 by 1 January, which would bring the overall US toll to 776,000.

50 million people lost their lives during the 1918 pandemic, at a time when the world's population was only one quarter of today's number.

The global toll from the Covid pandemic stands at over 4.6 million currently.

“We know that all pandemics come to an end,” said Dr Jeremy Brown, director of emergency care research at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote a book on influenza. “They can do terrible things while they’re raging.”

Covid-19 could have been far less lethal in the US if more people had gotten vaccinated faster, “and we still have an opportunity to turn it around”, Brown said. “We often lose sight of how lucky we are to take these things for granted.”

"The global production of food is responsible for a third of all planet-heating gases emitted by human activity, a major new study has found.

Meanwhile, the report revealed that use of animals for meat causes 60% of this pollution, which is twice that of plant-based foods.

The entire system of food production, such as the use of farming machinery, spraying of fertilizer and transportation of products, causes 17.3bn metric tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, according to the research. This enormous release of gases that fuel the climate crisis is more than double the entire emissions of the US and represents 35% of all global emissions, researchers said.

“The emissions are at the higher end of what we expected, it was a little bit of a surprise,” said Atul Jain, a climate scientist at the University of Illinois and co-author of the paper, published in Nature Food. “This study shows the entire cycle of the food production system, and policymakers may want to use the results to think about how to control greenhouse gas emissions.”

The raising and culling of animals for food is far worse for the climate than growing and processing fruits and vegetables for people to eat, the research found, confirming previous findings on the outsized impact that meat production, particularly beef, has on the environment.

"How do these images make you feel?

These images are all taken by underwater photographers who are determined to show us the ocean's silent struggle.

Whether it's a moray eel tangled in a 'ghost' fishing line, or lizardfish attempting to eat a cigarette end, the Ocean photography awards are a window into how human behaviour is affecting marine life.

Kerim Sabuncuoğlu won an award for his image of a moray eel that suffocated after becoming entangled in a fishing line. He witnessed the result of what’s known as ghost fishing. “When a fisherman leaves his equipment under the water, like a fishing net or line, it keeps on killing fish for many years to come,” he explains. “If I had left this moray eel, some other fish would have eaten the hook, and died as well.”

It’s a worldwide problem. Ghost fishing gear accounts for around an estimated 10% of all marine litter.

The National Geographic photographer and conservationist Cristina Mittermaier was among the judges who picked Sabuncuoğlu as the ocean conservation photographer of the year. “It’s a fantastic image,” she says.

“Underwater wildlife communicate in a very different way to terrestrial wildlife, and they don’t have the same facial expressions that an animal like a grizzly bear might have. Therefore, making images that create an emotional connection with humans, when you’re photographing fish, is really hard. In this image, the photographer was able to capture a dramatic moment, and the eel actually has a facial expression that conveys emotion. It caught me as soon as I saw it.”

Ten thousand years after the incredible giants vanished from the face of the Earth, scientists are embarking on an ambitious project to bring the beasts back to the Arctic tundra.

The prospect of recreating mammoths and returning them to the wild has been discussed, seriously at times, for more than a decade, but researchers have announced fresh funding they believe could make their dream a reality.

Within her speech she spoke directly to writers, urging them to “write the tale that scares you, that makes you feel uncertain, that isn’t comfortable. I dare you.”

The award was for her breakout hit show I May Destroy You which is about a young writer named Arabella who’s drugged and raped, and embarks on a quest for justice and self-knowledge.

Coel is the first Black woman to win the award, but as a whole the Emmys showed a diversity problem still remains - handing almost all the acting awards to white performers.

The awards had a diverse line-up of presenters and nominees across the board. But the likes of Billy Porter and Mj Rodriguez from Pose, the late Michael K. Williams from Lovecraft Country, and Kenan Thompson and Bowen Yang from Saturday Night Live, all went home empty-handed.

"In an effort to motivate people to adopt abandoned dogs, Romania's football federation has teamed up with local shelters so that for the whole season, at every match in the first division, the players will enter the field with stray dogs in their arms.

The aim of the 'fill the void in your life' initiative is to get people who are at the stadium or are watching the game at home to give the animals new homes. Dinamo Bucharest's players, pictured above, took part last weekend.

The plan is for the dogs to have name tags attached to them, as well as a scarf, so that it's easier for a viewer to recognise them when they get in touch about a possible adoption.

"Which alt-milk do you think is the most popular?

New research suggests that one in three people in Britain are now choosing plant-based milk alternatives - with analysts saying the uptake is being driven by environmental and health considerations.

Shoppers spent £100m more in 2020 on alt-milks, made from oats, almonds or soya, turning it into a near £400m-a-year market.

The findings, from Mintel, said 32% of those polled drank plant-based milk, which was up from 25% in 2020 - and it is even higher among 25- to 44-year-olds at 44%.

A quarter of the 2,000 people who took part in the research also said the pandemic had made eating vegan or plant-based food and drink more appealing to them. For the under-35s that figure rose to 38%.

The report also revealed that oat milk had become the plant-based milk of choice, overtaking almond to become the biggest seller in 2020.

The average person’s milk consumption in the UK has fallen 50% since the 1950s, however it soared on the back of pandemic lifestyle changes, with sales up by £100m to £3.2bn.

According to a 2018 study, a glass of dairy milk produces almost three times more greenhouse gas than any plant-based milk. But vegan options have drawbacks of their own ... so what milk should we drink?

"Despite how big, or small, Antartica looks on a map it's actually about 1.3 times as large as Europe and almost double the size of Australia.

Now scientists say the hole in the ozone layer and is this year bigger than the size of the continent.

Ozone exists about seven to 25 miles (11-40km) above the Earth’s surface, in the stratosphere, and acts like a sunscreen for the planet, shielding it from ultraviolet radiation.

Researchers from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, who are responsible for monitoring the hole, which develops annually, said it is “rather larger than usual”.

Every year, a hole forms during the late winter of the southern hemisphere as the sun causes ozone-depleting reactions, which involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from human-made compounds.

Vincent-Henri Peuch, the service’s director, told the Guardian: “The 2021 ozone hole is now among the 25% largest in our records since 1979, but the process is still under way.""

""A large or small ozone hole in one year does not necessarily mean that the overall recovery process is not going ahead as expected, but it can signal that special attention needs to be paid and research can be directed to study the reasons behind a specific ozone hole event.”

Scientists accept that the depletion in the ozone layer is caused by human-made gases called CFCs, which were first developed in the 1930s for use in refrigeration systems and were then deployed as propellants in aerosol spray cans.

Last month, separate research found these ozone-wrecking chemicals would have driven 2.5C of extra warming by 2100 if they had not been outlawed and that banning them has given us a fighting chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C as set out by the Paris agreement.

CFCs have been banned in 197 countries around the world - and since then the ozone layer has shown signs of recovery, but it is a slow process and it is is expected to take until the 2060s or 70s for a complete phasing-out of the depleting substances.

"“So how do Afghan women dress then? This is how.""

Those are the words of BBC journalist Sana Safi - one of hundreds of Afghan women around the world who have joined an online campaign sharing photos of themselves wearing traditional colourful clothes, using the hashtag #DoNotTouchMyClothes.

The protest is a response to a sit-down demonstration orchestrated by the Taliban at Kabul University, where about 300 women appeared in all-black garments covering their faces, hands and feet – the sort of dress previously never seen across the country.

Waving Taliban flags, the women said they supported the militants who have announced that women would not be allowed to hold high-ranking government positions and that schools and universities needed to be gender-segregated.

Since the Taliban took the capital Kabul, it has set up an all-male interim government. Many Afghan women, especially in urban centres, fear that their hard-gained freedoms might be limited, remembering the 1996 to 2001 Taliban regime that saw women largely confined to their homes.

Dr Bahar Jalali, an Afghan historian and gender studies expert, posted the first photo using the #DoNotTouchMyClothes hashtag, which has since inspired Afghan women across the globe.

Peymana Assad, the first person of Afghan origin to be elected to public office in the UK, posted a photo of herself in colourful garments (as seen on the fourth slide) and tweeted: “This is Afghan culture. My traditional dress.”

Despite the Taliban’s announcement that further protests would only be allowed if approved by the ministry of justice, women in Kabul have pledged to continue their demonstrations.

"Even the staunchest defenders of traditional whaling in the Faroe Islands have condemned the “cruel and unnecessary” massacre of nearly 1,500 dolphins on Sunday, which has been described as “the largest single killing of dolphins or pilot whales in the islands’ history”.

The dolphins were driven into shallow waters of the Skálabotnur beach on the island of Eysturoy and left writhing for hours before being killed.

The scale of the killing was such that even many Faroese, who frequently view the traditional Faroese “Grind” hunt as part of their cultural heritage, expressed disgust.

The Grind is significant for many Faroese people, with spectators coming out to watch from the shore, and the meat from the catch traditionally shared among the families that participated, with any excess then spread among local villagers.

But one local told the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet that there was no way that locals would want to consume this much dolphin meat and that most of the dolphins will be thrown in the trash or in a hole in the ground.

Captain Alex Cornelissen, the global chief executive of the Sea Shepherd group, which has been campaigning to stop the traditional Faroese “Grind” hunt since the 1980s, said that in the midst of a global pandemic it was “absolutely appalling to see an attack on nature of this scale in the Faroe Islands”.

"US gymnasts including Simone Biles and McKayla Maroney offered emotional testimonies on Tuesday at a senate hearing into the Larry Nassar abuse scandal.

Nassar, a former USA Gymnastics team doctor, is serving an effective life sentence after abusing dozens of athletes under his care. In moving scenes, his victims appeared in front of a senate committee to give searing testimonies on his abuse and the failure of the FBI to properly investigate it.

Biles began her testimony with a quote from Nelson Mandela that: “There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children.” She briefly had to pause after becoming overcome with emotion, before she continued.

“To be clear, I blame Larry Nassar and I also blame an entire system that enabled and perpetrated his abuse,” she said. “USA Gymnastics and the United States, Olympic and Paralympic Committee knew that I was abused by their official team doctor long before I was ever made aware of their knowledge.”

Biles, widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time, withdrew from several events at this summer’s Olympics to maintain her mental health. She acknowledged on Tuesday that the legacy of Nassar’s abuse had affected her.

The FBI is accused of failing to properly investigate allegations that Nassar was abusing athletes in his care. “Children suffered needlessly because multiple agents in multiple offices at the FBI neglected to share the Nassar allegations with their law enforcement counterparts at state and local agencies,” Republican senator Chuck Grassley said in prepared remarks before the hearing.",2021-09-16 00:31:44
"Can you see the resemblance?

The cultural icon @rupaulofficial has become the first drag queen to be forever enshrined as a soldier fly.

The RuPaul fly is part of a new Australian genus named Opaluma (from the Latin words for opal and thorn), because they look like “little gems buzzing around the forest floor” and have a distinctive thorn tucked under their abdomen.

It is 50th species to be named by @csirogram entomologist Bryan Lessard. A decade ago, the first insect he named after a pop culture icon was the Beyoncé fly – Scaptia beyonceae, in 2011.

At the time, it caused quite a stir, and was “frowned upon” by some taxonomists, but @bry_the_fly_guy said the growing naming practice had helped threatened species gain attention in response to environmental threats such as climate change.

Lessard said naming the soldier fly Opaluma rupaul came as an “obvious decision”.

“I was watching a lot of RuPaul’s Drag Race while examining the species and I know it would challenge RuPaul on the runway serving fierce looks,” Lessard said.

“It has a costume of shiny metallic rainbow colours, and it has legs for days. I think once (Ru) sees the fly she’ll realise it’s quite fierce and hopefully appreciate the name.”

He hopes CSIRO's work will encourage citizen scientists and conservationists to help to monitor wildlife and insects, part of a national push for scientists to document and name every Australian species.

“We really need to encourage next generation to help us name and describe and protect our unique biodiversity in Australia.”

"Do you recognise this sculpture? A little a least?

The life-size bronze artwork is based on Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa - and has just gone on public display in Bristol ... butt has already divided some opinion among art-lovers.

The 'Moona Lisa' is a reimagined version of acclaimed street artist Nick Walker's spray painting on the same subject, as seen on the second slide, which sold for £54,000 at London’s Bonhams auction house in 2008.

Walker created the original painting in response to a challenge from Banksy - a fellow artist and Bristolian - who said nothing more could be done with the Mona Lisa.

To create the 3D piece, a rig comprising of 160 DSLR cameras was constructed which captured a 360 image of a live model dressed as the Moona Lisa.

From this image a digital model was created which was then used as the mould for the final bronze sculpture.

"How has the climate crisis affected your outlook on having kids?

Four in 10 young people around the world are hesitant to have children as a result of global heating, and fear that governments are doing too little to prevent climate catastrophe, a poll in 10 countries has found.

Nearly six in 10 young people, aged 16 to 25, were very or extremely worried about climate change, according to the scientific study - the biggest yet on climate anxiety and young people.

A similar number said governments were not protecting them, the planet, or future generations, and felt betrayed by the older generation and governments.

Young climate activists said feelings of anxiety over the climate were now widespread among today’s youth.

Mitzi Tan, 23, from the Philippines, said: “I grew up being afraid of drowning in my own bedroom. Society tells me that this anxiety is an irrational fear that needs to be overcome, one that meditation and healthy coping mechanisms will ‘fix’.” At its root, our climate anxiety comes from this deep-set feeling of betrayal because of government inaction. To truly address our growing climate anxiety, we need justice.”

The poll of about 10,000 young people covered Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Portugal, the UK and the US. It was paid for by the campaigning organisation Avaaz.

Three-quarters of those who took part agreed with the statement “the future is frightening”, and more than half felt they would have fewer opportunities than their parents.

Nearly half reported feeling distressed or anxious about the climate in a way that was affecting their daily lives and functioning.

Earlier this month, Unicef found that children and young people around the world were bearing the brunt of the climate crisis, with 1 billion children at “extreme risk” from the impacts of climate breakdown.

Now, Aden says she felt she had to compromise to fit into the industry. “Despite me saying, ‘Don’t change yourself, change the game,’ that was exactly what I was doing,” she told the Times.

“I’m not saying it’s not right for other Muslim, hijab-wearing women, I’m saying it was not right for me. I wear a hijab, I’m a Muslim, I’m Somali, so yes, all these identities set me up to be the perfect token to check all the boxes. I felt like one of the biggest tokens in the industry. I always felt like an outsider in my own career.”

In July, she spoke of the “internal conflict” she felt in the last two years of her career. “My hijab kept shrinking and got smaller and smaller with each shoot,” she told the BBC.

The former model also spoke about a “horrendous” magazine cover that made her look like a “white man’s fetishised version of me”. She didn’t name the publication.

Last week, she announced her return to the fashion industry, not as a model but as a designer. Aden signed a two-year contract with the modest fashion label Modanisa, and her first designs for Halima X Modanisa include headscarves. In a statement, she said: “[Modanisa] shares my faith and values, and fully respects my choices as a Muslim woman.”

"Could controlling toilet habits of cows be the key to more environmentally friendly farming?

In Germany, one herd has been “potty-trained” in an experiment to teach calves to use a toilet area in their barn, meaning that urine could be collected and treated.

Scientists trained the cows via a system of rewards and mild punishments. When they urinated in the assigned area, they were given a sweet drink or some mashed barley, and when they relieved themselves elsewhere, they were surprised by a short blast of water from above.

Waste from cattle farms often contaminates soil and waterways and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and the acidification of soil.

For this reason, toilet-training cattle has long been viewed as desirable, but several previous attempts have been unsuccessful.

Within a few weeks, after about 15 training sessions, 11 out of the 16 calves in the experiment had been successfully toilet-trained, according to the study published in the journal Current Biology.

“Cattle, like many other animals, are quite clever and they can learn a lot,” said Jan Langbein, an animal psychologist at the Research Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN) in Germany. “Why shouldn’t they be able to learn how to use a toilet?”

Langbein said a future ambition would be to teach cows to also defecate in a toilet area.

The ammonia produced in cow urine doesn’t directly contribute to the climate crisis, but when it leaches into the soil, microbes convert it into nitrous oxide, which is the third most significant greenhouse gas after methane and carbon dioxide.

"What do they say about cats having nine lives?

This feline seemingly used one up here surviving a dramatic fall after somehow getting into Miami Gardens, the University of Miami's stadium, for a college football match. 

The cat was filmed dangling from an upper stand for a couple of seconds. As the crowd looked on, some quick thinking spectators thankfully used an American flag as a makeshift net to cushion the animal's fall.

The stadium tweeted after the event saying 'we wish the cat the best in its remaining eight lives'.

"There's high fashion ... and then there's higher taxes fashion, as @AOC has shown at this year's Met Gala. 

The New York congresswoman turned heads at the annual event, wearing a white gown by Brother Vellies containing a not-so-hidden message: tax the rich.

It was AOC's first appearance at the ball and, as you might expect, has sparked a somewhat predictable yet fierce debate on social media.

While many have embraced AOC's fashion statement, many of her critics have (once again) accused her of hypocrisy due to the costly and luxurious nature of the event, and partying with the elites she wants to tax. 

But what do you think? Does wanting the rich to pay more in taxes mean you can't party with them? Should AOC have protested outside instead? Or is it ok to endorse a wealth tax while also attending such a glitzy event? As Yale professor Jason Stanley tweeted: ""AOC is, in fact, pushing legislation to tax the rich. Good for her for making it cool. That’s why she’s going to win."" 

However, you may also be indifferent, and agree more with Melania Trump, who in 2018 famously wore a jacket emblazoned with the message: ""I really don't care, do u?""

Either way, the debate over whether democratic socialists can have nice things rages on.

"A hospital in New York will at least temporarily stop delivering babies later this month, after too many employees resigned over a rule that made Covid-19 vaccinations compulsory.

“The number of resignations received leaves us no choice but to pause delivering babies at Lewis county general hospital,” chief executive of the Lewis County Health System, told reporters.

Amid alarm over the highly infectious Delta variant and continued evidence that vaccines are both safe and effective, New York state has required healthcare workers to be vaccinated.

The mandate makes room for medical exemptions but excludes religious ones. Hospitals and nursing homes must comply by 27 September.

Nearly three quarters of staff in the Lewis County Health System have received the jab, including 30 employees after the mandate was announced in August. But another 30 have resigned – 21 from clinical areas – and 165 remain unvaccinated, leaders say.

Already chronically short-staffed, the Lewis county general hospital maternity department took a debilitating hit after six employees resigned from the obstetrics service. Another seven are still deciding whether to get vaccinated or leave.

Patients may now have to rely on other facilities for maternity and postpartum care. Other departments are at risk and the hospital strongly encourages staff to get the shot.

"Picture this: you're 18, taking in the sights of New York City and then you spot it ... a huge billboard of yourself celebrating the biggest win of your career.

That's what today looked like for US Open champion Emma Raducanu.

She emerged from her hotel, following three weeks of experiencing the city primarily through Uber Eats, having made tennis history. Keen to do some sightseeing after becoming the first British woman to win a grand slam in 44 years, the teenager stepped out and was met with a giant poster of her triumph.

In three months, she has gone from being a student waiting for her A-level results to reaching the last 16 at Wimbledon and then, in unprecedented fashion, to winning 10 straight matches to qualify for the main draw at the US Open and then go all the way to the title.

Born in Toronto, when @emmaraducanu was two her family moved to south-east London, England. “I think that the calmness and the mental strength definitely comes from my upbringing,” she said following her victory over Leyla Fernandez on Saturday.

Raducanu was introduced to tennis by her parents at the age of five, and enjoyed ballet, horse riding, swimming, go-karting and motocross, and her love of cars helped her relax between matches at the US Open as she watched the Dutch Grand Prix.

And when she played in Chicago just before winning her first grand slam, Raducanu revealed her love of architecture, finding time to visit “the Bean”, Anish Kapoor’s sculpture.

For many players, it can be easy to forget that there is life outside the tennis bubble, other things to keep your mind occupied and settled. But Raducanu’s secret seems to be to embrace everything, from culture to food, friends and family to travel, music to F1.

“I definitely think it’s the time to just switch off from any future thoughts or any plans, any schedule,” she said after her win, when asked where she would be playing next. “I’ve got absolutely no clue. Right now, no care in the world, I’m just loving life.”

"This is 12-year-old Francisco Vera.

At the beginning of the year, the young environmentalist was sent anonymous death threats on Twitter after calling for better access to education for children during the coronavirus pandemic.

The news caused outrage in Colombia and made headlines around the world. But nine months later, nobody has been arrested - and the fear and anxiety caused have not gone away.

Even though Francisco is a child, his mother Ana Maria Manzanares knows her son’s activism puts him at risk from groups that would rather he remained quiet; ""I am always watching out. The threat might never materialise. But from the moment you’re told about it, in a country like Colombia, you expect anything could happen at any moment.”

In 2020, for the second year running, the South American country was the most deadly in the world for environmental defenders, according to Global Witness, which recorded 65 killings.

Manzanares says she had anticipated threats over her son’s campaigning but had not expected them to come so soon. Even so, she does not want to stand in the way of her son’s passion for nature.

Francisco is a well-known environmentalist and defender of his country's extraordinary biodiversity that stretches from the high Andes to the Caribbean and Pacific coasts. He uses his social media profiles, which have thousands of followers, to campaign against fracking and mining.

After the death threats in January, the Colombian government gave Francisco a bodyguard. But his mother says what they really want is for someone to be brought to justice.

"'The sexiest man alive.'

Anthony Fauci, an 80-year-old scientist, doctor and public servant, has become an unlikely cult hero for millions of people during the Covid pandemic.

The US diseases expert has been spoofed by Brad Pitt and lauded as the ‘sexiest man alive’.

Now the pop culture phenomenon is the focus of a documentary, appropriately titled: Fauci.

“At the core of Tony’s popularity is that people intuit that this is a man who is speaking the truth and will not let anything stand in the way,” says John Hoffman, the co-director of a new documentary.

“Tony is the signal amid the noise. People are able to sense that there’s a lot of noise and their ears are trying to find the signal and Tony is the signal.”

"“Please let me hug my family before it’s too late!”

That's the title of a petition that has been signed by over 240,000 people demanding a new law ending isolation for care home residents, with many saying care operators are still refusing to follow government advice and are imposing their own stricter regimes.

100-year-old care home resident Frances Heaton has issued a video plea for greater freedom, complaining that thousands of people can go to pop festivals but she is being prevented from seeing two of her children at her home in Yorkshire.

Government guidance is that every care home resident in England can have an unlimited number of “named visitors” who will be able to enter the care home for regular visits after negative tests and they can also nominate one essential care giver who undergoes regular testing who may visit the home to attend to essential care needs.

Hundreds of families are to protest in Westminster next week over restrictions on residents’ access to their families in care homes and the lack of legal visiting rights after 18 months of lockdowns. The protest, organised by the Rights for Residents campaign group, will be led by the actor Ruthie Henshall, whose mother, Gloria, died recently after isolation in a care home that allowed only “window visits”.

“My name is Frances,” Heaton said in the message from her room. “I was 100 years old in March. After 18 months of being shut out from the outsider world my daughter can now see me in my room. But my other daughter and my son are not allowed in my room. But 90,000 people can visit the Leeds Festival. Human rights and equality are out of order altogether.”

Jenny Morrison, the co-founder of Rights for Residents, said: “Some people are paying £8,000 a month [in care fees] and haven’t got the right to decide who comes into their home. We feel that if social care is going to be reformed, they should look at the rights of people in care homes and the responsibilities of people that look after them.”

"What do you reckon? Will you be buying a pair?

""An entirely new way for people to stay connected to the world around them and truly be present in life’s most important moments,"" is how the 'smart glasses' are being pitched by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth.

You can take calls, listen to podcasts, and take images or video, but there is no augmented reality layered on top of the real world. Building true augmented reality is the ultimate goal of Facebook's Reality Labs division.

The frames are just a few millimetres thicker than a standard pair of Wayfarers, and each wing of the glasses hides a camera, which combine to shoot still images and video of up to 30 seconds with a long or short tap of the device’s only button.

The glasses don’t actually come from Facebook at all. Instead, the company is working with Ray-Ban, on whose classic Wayfarer designs the hardware has been modelled, and the device will be branded as a Ray-Ban product first and foremost.

If the whole thing sounds, and looks, familiar, it’s because the concept bears a heavy resemblance to Snapchat’s Spectacles, now in their third generation.

“We believe that this will be the first pair of smart glasses people will truly want to wear,"" says Facebook’s Monisha Perkash.

"An experiment that hung rhinos upside-down to see if it was better for the animals has been awarded one of this year's Ig Nobel prizes.

Groundbreaking studies into how well beards soften punches to the face, as well as orgasms as a nasal decongestant were honoured on Thursday night with one of the most coveted awards in science.

Not to be confused with the more prestigious – and lucrative – Nobel awards, to be announced from Stockholm and Oslo next month, the Ig Nobels celebrate the quirkier realms of science, rewarding research that first makes people laugh and then makes them think.

The transportation prize went to a group that found airlifting tranquilised rhinoceroses upside down is probably better for them than carrying them on their sides in slings.

Wildlife veterinarian Robin Radcliffe, from Cornell University, and colleagues hung 12 rhinos upside-down for 10 minutes in Namibia because they wanted to know if the health of the animals might be compromised when slung by their legs beneath a helicopter.

Rhinos are being increasingly transported in African conservation efforts to shift the animals between fragmented habitats. This study wanted to ensure that the upside-down methods being used were safe.

The scientist looked at the tranquillised animals' heart and lung function while being carried upside down and found there was evidence that it was better than lying chest down or on their side.

""This has really changed rhino translocation, and even more so elephant translocation. Picking these big animals up by their feet - it's now accepted. The next thing we've got to do is some research on other species like buffalo, hippo, and maybe even giraffe,"" said team-member and wildlife doctor Pete Morkel to BBC News.

The 18-year-old outclassed Maria Sakkari, the Greek 17th seed, 6-1, 6-4 in the US Open semi-final to become the first qualifier, man or woman, to reach a grand slam final in the Open era.

She is also the first British woman to reach a grand slam final since Virginia Wade’s triumph at Wimbledon in 1977.

"""It is unacceptable that women cannot protect themselves ... because they cannot afford it.""

France's health minister has announced that women under the age of 25 will be offered free contraception from next year.

Olivier Véran said they would not not be charged for medical appointments, tests, or other medical procedures related to birth control.

Explaining the move, Véran said that studies had shown this was the age that many women were dropping contraception, not because they wanted to have children but “because it is expensive”.

Contraception has been free in France for those aged between 15 and 18 since 2013 and for the under-15s since August 2020. This has led to a drop in the number of abortions.

For women over 25, about 65% of the cost of contraception is reimbursed.

The measure, which covers the pill, IUD devices and contraceptive implants, is expected to cost France’s health system, the Assurance Maladie, about €21m a year.

"Activists in Mexico have hailed a supreme court decision to decriminalise abortion, saying it would stop the legal prosecution of women who terminate their pregnancies – and those reported to the authorities after suffering miscarriages.

The decision, handed down unanimously on Tuesday, declared that criminal sanctions for abortion in the northern state of Coahuila were unconstitutional. The decision sets precedent, according to lawyers involved in abortion cases, and will be applicable across the country.

The ruling came just days after the US supreme court refused to block a near-total ban on abortion in Texas, and has prompted speculation that women in the US state may head across the border to seek terminations.

In the past two years, Oaxaca, Veracruz and Hidalgo followed Mexico City’s 2007 precedent and decriminalised abortion, but activists say elective abortions are still difficult to obtain in those states because medical workers refuse to make the procedure available.

On Wednesday, one Mexican state governor announced he would release all women imprisoned for having abortions.

Coahuila’s governor, Miguel Riquelme, said in a statement “the resolution will have retroactive effects, and if there is any woman deprived of her freedom for the crime of abortion, she must be released immediately.”

Activists and lawyers say the ruling is likely to bring about a change in legal culture and fewer criminal investigations, as the justices based their decision on human rights arguments and a woman’s right to decide rather than on legal technicalities.

"From @guardian_us: New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had to explain basic biology to Texas governor Greg Abbott, after he claimed six weeks was ample time to get an abortion.

Abbott inaccurately defended his state’s new anti-abortion law, saying that it does not require victims of rape and incest to carry pregnancies to term because it provides enough time for a person to get an abortion.

Ocasio-Cortez called Abbott’s remarks “disgusting,” adding: “I do know that he is not familiar with a female or menstruating person’s body because if he [was], he would know you don’t have six weeks.”

Cortez went on to explain the basic biology surrounding pregnancies, and that many pregnancies are often undetected at six weeks. She said: “In case no one has informed him before in his life, six weeks pregnant means two weeks late on your period. And two weeks late on your period, for any person with a menstrual cycle, can happen if you’re stressed, if your diet changes, or for really no reason at all. So you don’t have six weeks.”

The law, which took effect on 1 September, is the most extreme anti-abortion measure in the US and essentially bans most abortions, offering no exceptions for rape or incest.

"Afghan women, including the country’s national women’s cricket team, will be banned from playing sport under the new Taliban government, according to an official in the hardline Islamist group.

A new Taliban interim government drawn exclusively from loyalist ranks formally began work on Wednesday, with established hardliners in all key posts and no women – despite previous promises to form an inclusive administration.

And in an interview with the Australian broadcaster SBS, the deputy head of the Taliban’s cultural commission, Ahmadullah Wasiq, said women’s sport was considered neither appropriate or necessary.

“I don’t think women will be allowed to play cricket because it is not necessary that women should play cricket,” Wasiq said.

“In cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered. Islam does not allow women to be seen like this.

“It is the media era, and there will be photos and videos, and then people watch it. Islam and the Islamic Emirate [Afghanistan] do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed.”

The ban on playing sport comes amid mounting evidence that the Taliban’s attitude towards women has barely moderated since they were last in power, despite claims to the contrary.

The issue of women’s rights is likely to dominate how the regime is judged by the international community, with the stance on women’s sport and the all-male government being ominous warning signs.

"In an unexpected move, Britney Spears’ father has filed a request to terminate the controversial conservatorship that has controlled the singer’s life for 13 years.

Jamie Spears, who is the conservator of his daughter’s estate, said “recent events” called into question whether she still needed a court to oversee her personal affairs and finances.

Britney Spears, was placed under the conservatorship, a complex legal arrangement usually reserved for the very old or frail, in 2008 after suffering a series of mental breakdowns.

Spears has twice addressed the court in recent months, describing the conservatorship as “abusive”. She has not performed since 2018 and has said she would not return to the stage while her father was conservator.

Jamie Spears’ representatives have previously defended the conservatorship and his role in the arrangement. Her father long had control over her finances and healthcare, but stepped down as a personal conservator in 2019. A licensed conservator now oversees her medical treatment, and her father has maintained authority over her money.

But the new filing at a court in Los Angeles states: “Ms Spears has told this court that she wants control of her life back without the safety rails of a conservatorship.

“She wants to be able to make decisions regarding her own medical care, deciding when, where and how often to get therapy. She wants to control the money she has made from her career and spend it without supervision or oversight.

“She wants to be able to get married and have a baby, if she so chooses. In short, she wants to live her life as she chooses without the constraints of a conservator or court proceeding.”

Britney’s lawyer, Mathew Rosengart, said he welcomed the termination request by her father, and that it was a victory and vindication for the singer, before adding; “It appears that Mr Spears believes he can try to avoid accountability and justice, including sitting for a sworn deposition and answering other discovery under oath, but as we assess his filing .. we will also continue to explore all options.”

The next hearing is scheduled for 29 September.

"Twenty livestock companies are responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than either Germany, Britain or France – and are receiving billions of dollars in financial backing to do so, according to a new report by environmental campaigners.

Between 2015 and 2020, global meat and dairy companies received more than US$478bn in backing from 2,500 investment firms, banks, and pension funds, most of them based in North America or Europe, according to the Meat Atlas, which was compiled by Friends of the Earth and the European political foundation, Heinrich Böll Stiftung.

Although the vast majority of growth was likely to take place in the global south, the biggest producers will continue to be China, Brazil, the USA and the members of the European Union. By 2029 these countries may still produce 60% of worldwide meat output.

Across the world, the report says, three-quarters of all agricultural land is used to raise animals or the crops to feed them. “In Brazil alone, 175m hectares is dedicated to raising cattle,” an area of land that is about equal to the “entire agricultural area of the European Union”.

Raising livestock contributes significantly to carbon emissions, with animal agriculture accounting for 14.5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Scientific reports have found that rich countries need huge reductions in meat and dairy consumption to tackle the climate emergency.

The new report has now called for more meat industry regulation and for private banks and investors to stop financing large-scale, intensive animal protein production projects.

"Warm-blooded animals are getting larger beaks, legs and ears to adapt to a hotter climate and to better regulate their temperature.

When animals overheat, birds use their beaks and mammals use their ears to disperse the warmth. Some creatures in warmer climates have historically evolved to have larger beaks or ears to get rid of heat more easily. These differences are becoming more pronounced as the climate warms.

If animals fail to control their body temperature, they can overheat and die. Beaks, which are not covered by feathers and therefore not insulated, are a site of significant heat exchange, as are ears, tails and legs in mammals if not covered by fur.

The review, published in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution, found that the differences are particularly pronounced in birds.

The author of the study, Sara Ryding of Deakin university, a bird researcher, said: “Shapeshifting does not mean that animals are coping with climate change and that all is fine.

“It just means they are evolving to survive it – but we’re not sure what the other ecological consequences of these changes are, or indeed that all species are capable of changing and surviving.”

While the scientists say it is difficult to pinpoint climate breakdown as the sole cause of the shapeshifting, it is what the instances studied have in common across geographical regions and across a diverse array of species.

Examples include several species of Australian parrot that have shown a 4-10% increase in bill size since 1871, positively correlated with the summer temperature each year.

"The actor Michael K Williams, who died yesterday at the age of 54, was best known for his role as Omar Little in The Wire which aired from 2002 to 2008.

Isiah Whitlock Jr, who played Senator Davis in the show, described Williams as “one of the nicest brothers on the planet with the biggest heart. An amazing actor and soul.”

Wendell Pierce, who played Detective Bunk Moreland in the series, described Williams as ""an immensely talented man with the ability to give voice to the human condition portraying the lives of those whose humanity is seldom elevated until he sings their truth”.n

While it was his role in The Wire that gave Williams mainstream success, the Brooklyn-born actor starred in other critically acclaimed films and TV series.

"“To them, we owe … the history of our country, of our fatherland”.

A statue of the explorer Christopher Columbus, which stood on one of Mexico City's main boulevards, is set to be replaced by one of an indigenous woman.

The city's Mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, said a new statue of an Olmec woman will aim to deliver ""social justice"" for the historic role of women in Mexico, especially indigenous women.

The Olmec people are believed to be one of the country's first major civilisations.

Columbus, an Italian-born explorer, has become a symbol of oppression and colonialism and the statue was a regular target of demonstrators protesting against the suppression of Mexico’s Indigenous civilisations.

Sculptor Pedro Reyes, who has been given the job of creating the new monument said; ""It's very important to dedicate a monument to indigenous women and to the Earth, because if anyone can teach us how to take care of this planet, it's our native peoples, and that is precisely what we must learn again"".

"All of these people were blinded by police in May 2020 during protests following the death of George Floyd.

""Something in my head told me the teargas canister was the last thing I’d ever see clearly,"" Photojournalist Wil Sands writes about his experience of being shot and partially blinded with an aluminium teargas canister fired by police while he covered the Black Lives Matter protests.

According to Shot in the Head, a report released in September 2020 by Physicians for Human Rights, during the protests between 26 May and 27 July of last year, US law enforcement officials shot 115 people in the head with “less lethal weapons”. Of these victims, at least 30 suffered permanent ocular damage.

""It’s perhaps needless to say that any eye-related injury is basically a photographer’s worst nightmare, tantamount to a musician going deaf,"" Sands writes.

While dealing with the aftereffects of his injury, Sands came up with a new mission: ""meet as many of the other people blinded by the police as I could.""

As well as a powerful photo essay, the survivors are part of a growing WhatsApp group where they share solidarity, news of diagnoses, and the odd bit of ""off-color eye humor"".

""For the first time in my professional life, I felt like my work was having a tangible impact on the world,"" says Sands.

"The world's largest lizard ​is threatened with extinction as rising water levels driven by the climate crisis shrink its habitat, according to the latest “red list” update.

The komodo dragon moves from vulnerable to endangered on the IUCN red list of threatened species.

The latest update is the first for the komodo dragon in more than 20 years. It comes after the first peer-reviewed paper on how global heating would affect the giant lizards concluded “urgent conservation actions are required to avoid risk of extinction”.

The komodo dragon can only be found on a handful of Indonesian islands, where they live on the edge of forest or in open savannah, rarely venturing higher than 700 metres above sea level.

As well as being unable to move to higher ground, the komodo dragons’ habitat is becoming increasingly fragmented by human activity, which makes populations less genetically healthy and more vulnerable.

Rising water levels are set to affect 30% of its habitat in the next 45 years.

"A reconstructed triceratops - nicknamed Big John - is expected to fetch up to €1.5m when he's auctioned off at Paris’s Drouot auction house on 21 October.

Approximately 66m years ago, the triceratops, with its massive collared skull and three attacking horns, was one of the most dangerous and daunting of dinosaurs.

Big John has a skull and bony collar measuring 2.62 metres long, 2 metres wide and weighing more than 700kg, two large horns measuring more than a metre, and 200 other assorted bones that have been painstakingly pieced together.

The herbivore lived in Laramidia, an island continent that stretched from what is now Alaska to Mexico, and died in an ancient flood plain now known as the Hell Creek geological formation in South Dakota. As the plain is composed of sediment with no biological activity, Big John was mostly fossilised and preserved.

“Big John, over 60% complete and with a 75% complete skull, is both a miracle of nature and work of art,” said a spokesperson for the auctioneers, Giquelo.

"The pop singer and TV personality Sarah Harding, who had 21 UK Top 10 singles as a member of Girls Aloud, has died aged 39 from breast cancer.

In a post on Instagram, Harding’s mother Marie said: “It’s with deep heartbreak that today I’m sharing the news that my beautiful daughter Sarah has sadly passed away.

“Many of you will know of Sarah’s battle with cancer and that she fought so strongly from her diagnosis until her last day. She slipped away peacefully this morning.

“I’d like to thank everyone for their kind support over the past year. It meant the world to Sarah and it gave her great strength and comfort to know she was loved.

“I know she won’t want to be remembered for her fight against this terrible disease – she was a bright shining star and I hope that’s how she can be remembered instead. – Marie x”.

In August 2020, Harding announced that she had been diagnosed with the disease and was receiving chemotherapy. “My amazing mum, family and close friends are helping me through this, and I want to say a thank you to the wonderful NHS doctors and nurses who have been and continue to be heroes,” she said at the time.

Harding was born in 1981 in Berkshire and raised in Stockport. She left school early and began focusing on a music career, initially recording vocals for dance producers. In 2002, she unsuccessfully auditioned for BBC talent show Fame Academy, but successfully entered ITV’s Popstars: The Rivals that year.

The format created a boy band, One True Voice, and a girl band, Girls Aloud, who were then pitted against each other for that year’s Christmas No 1. Girls Aloud, with Harding alongside Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Tweedy and Kimberley Walsh – “five northern girls with attitude, very outspoken,” as Harding described them – were triumphant, with their debut single Sound of the Underground becoming the first of four UK chart-toppers and 21 Top 10 hits in a decade-long career.

In 2021, she published a memoir, Hear Me Out, written in the wake of her diagnosis. She said she was “inundated with lovely messages from my fans,” after announcing her illness. “I’m grateful beyond words for that,” she added.",2021-09-05 17:01:43

"“The more people know about box turtles, the more friends they have.”

Turtle tracker John Rucker and his six Boykin spaniels are on a mission to keep box turtles, North Carolina’s official state reptile, safe from threats to their natural habitat in the 1,000-acre Sherwood Forest neighborhood.

A species in decline, the slow-living box turtle is vulnerable to everything we do as humans.

And because they’re camouflaged and relatively secretive, they are hard to find, which makes studying their population and health inherently difficult.

But with the help of his dogs, 74-year-old Rucker is determined to keep his “kinship” with the turtles going.

"‘I know you've never faced those choices, nor have you ever been pregnant’.

This is what White House press secretary Jen Psaki said when pressed by a male reporter about why President Biden, a Catholic, supports abortion rights.

The US president condemned the supreme court decision not to consider a Texas law that in effect bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.

'It's a woman's body and it's her choice. I know you've never faced those choices, nor have you ever been pregnant,' said Psaki adding that the president believed a woman's choices should be respected.

"The death toll from floods and tornadoes in the US north-east rose past 40 on Thursday, as authorities continued to digest the full impact of the remnants of Hurricane Ida.

The storm ultimately dumped more than 9in of rain in parts of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and nearly as much on Staten Island in New York City.

In New York City, police said at least 13 people died, one in a car and 11 in flooded basement apartments that often serve as relatively affordable homes in one of the nation’s most expensive housing markets.

Major flooding along the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania swamped highways, submerged cars and disrupted rail service.

Officials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape.

In Connecticut, a state police sergeant perished after his cruiser was swept away. A 19-year-old man was killed in flooding at an apartment complex in Rockville, Maryland, police said.

New York’s resilience to flooding was under renewed scrutiny. It was the second time in recent weeks that subway stations and streets were submerged.

In a speech at the White House in Washington on Thursday, Joe Biden said: “These extreme storms, and the climate crisis, are here. We must be better prepared. We need to act.”

"Mamma Mia, here we go again ...

One of the most anticipated comebacks in pop culture has finally come to pass: the return of Abba.

Forty years after the bitter songs written in the wake of two band divorces for their last album, The Visitors, the Swedish pop quartet have reunited.

New album, Voyage, includes brand new songs that will be released on 5 November – including, they say, a Christmas song.

Two tracks from it, the stately and epic ballad I Still Have Faith in You and the shimmying Don’t Shut Me Down, are out now.

The group – Benny Andersson, Agnetha Fältskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Björn Ulvaeus – have also announced a new concert experience in London, also called Voyage, beginning in May 2022.

Digital versions of themselves (not holograms, their team asserted) will appear nightly alongside a 10-piece live band at a new 3,000-capacity venue in the city’s Olympic park, called the Abba Arena.

Lyngstad said of their reunion: “Such joy it was to work with the group again – I am so happy with what we have made,” and called Andersson and Ulvaeus “exceptionally talented, truly genius songwriters”.

Andersson added: “We’re truly sailing in uncharted waters. With the help of our younger selves, we travel into the future.”

"In rainy conditions on the foothills of Mount Fuji, Dame Sarah Storey completed a journey she began 29 years ago, as she won her 17th gold medal to become, outright, the most successful British Paralympian of all time.

Storey made her maiden Paralympic appearance in Barcelona as a swimmer at the age of 14. She competed in the pool at the following three games and won five gold medals before switching to cycling in 2008. Since then, her success has only accelerated, winning nine golds across Beijing, London and Rio before her latest treble in Tokyo took her past the total set by the swimmer Mike Kenny between 1976 and 1988.

Reflecting on her success is not something that comes readily to Storey who, after her victory, practically confirmed she intends to race again when the Paralympics head to Paris in 2024.

“I just wanted to be a British athlete, I wanted to compete for my country for as long as I possibly could. I couldn’t have imagined having eight Games, let alone winning medals at every Games, and 17 of those medals being gold. It’s the dream I didn’t have, coming true.”

"***UPDATE*** The federal government has decided to match the bonus for Paralympians.

In late July, as soon as Emma McKeon won the first of her four gold medals at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre, she was guaranteed a $20,000 bonus.

Last week, when another Australian swimmer, Lakeisha Patterson, did the same thing at the same venue, she received nothing.

The difference? One was competing at an Olympic Games, and the other a Paralympics.

It is through no fault of her own that McKeon is both able-bodied and highly decorated enough to qualify her for the Australian Olympic Committee’s lucrative cash prizes. The AOC simply has the money to reward its athletes while its para-counterpart, Paralympics Australia, does not.

Still, the stark discrepancy – felt by para-athletes throughout the Paralympic cycle – has become externally apparent during the Tokyo 2020 Games. Australian viewers watching more intently while in lockdown have voiced their discomfort, and one able-bodied sportswoman has done something about it.

Chloe Dalton, who was a part of Australia’s gold medal-winning rugby sevens team at Rio 2016 and now plays for the AFLW’s GWS Giants, had read about Team USA’s parity in this space, with Olympic and Paralympic gold medallists each receiving $52,000.

“I assumed it was going to be the same for Australian Paralympians,” she says. “So I was pretty shocked when it came out that they actually received nothing when they win a medal.”

"From @guardian_us: The most extreme abortion ban in the US has gone into effect in Texas despite legal efforts to block it – and given the supreme court's lack of intervention so far, it's the latest signal that Roe v Wade could soon be unraveled.

A near-total abortion ban in the southern state empowers any private citizen to sue an abortion provider who violates the law, opening the floodgates to harassing and frivolous lawsuits from anti-abortion vigilantes that could eventually shutter most clinics in the state.

More widely, the fact that the supreme court has not yet intervened over the enactment of the law, which many see as unconstitutional, bodes badly for an upcoming case brought by Mississippi that could overturn Roe v Wade. 

So what are pro-choice Americans supposed to do? Kathryn Kolbert and Julie F Kay, the authors of Controlling Women: What We Must Do Now to Save Reproductive Freedom, have an answer.

First of all, they say ""we must stop banging our heads against the supreme court’s marble walls,"" and fight for new laws at the state and federal levels.

""When rightwing state legislators whip up their base at the expense of reproductive freedoms, we need to cry out with loud and creative protests and demand that corporations and politicians join the call for our rights,"" they write. ""As the supreme court diminishes Roe, let’s call for a blitz of laws in Democratic-led states that assert abortion as a right for all who need it.""

"Air pollution is cutting short the lives of billions of people by up to six years, according to a new report, making it a far greater killer than smoking, car crashes or HIV/Aids.

Coal burning is the main culprit, and India is worst affected, with the average citizen dying six years early.

China has slashed air pollution in the last seven years, but dirty air is still cutting 2.6 years from its people’s lifespan.

Fossil fuel burning is causing air pollution and the climate crisis, but nations have much greater power to cut dirty air within their own borders.

The climate crisis is now also adding to air pollution by driving wildfires, completing a vicious circle, the scientists said.

The team said recent events had illustrated the different futures possible depending on whether governments act or not.

“Air pollution is the greatest external threat to human health on the planet, and that is not widely recognised, or not recognised with the force and vigour that one might expect,” said Prof Michael Greenstone, who developed the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution levels into their impact on life expectancy.

“Furthermore, we’re not just letting it happen, we’re actually causing it.""

He said switching to cleaner energy and enforcing air quality measures on existing power plants have cut pollution in many countries.

China began a “war against pollution” in 2013 and has reduced levels by 29%. This is adding an average of 1.5 years on to lives, assuming the cuts are sustained, the scientists said, and shows rapid action is possible.

Researchers made the discovery while studying Goffin’s cockatoos on the Tanimbar Islands, a remote archipelago in Indonesia.

The team noticed the behaviour in two wild cockatoos, who crafted tools from tree branches and used them to extract seed matter from sea mangoes, a tropical fruit.

They found that the cockatoos showed a high level of dexterity in manufacturing and using the cutlery.

After observing the behaviour repeatedly and collecting some of the cutlery used by the birds, the team were able to classify the tools into three types.

The birds used sturdy, thick twigs to wedge open a fruit and allow access to its inner portion, fine tools to pierce the layer surrounding a seed like a knife, and medium-sized tools to spoon out the inner seed matter.

"As the sun rose over the city of New Orleans, the streets quiet but for the crunch of detritus under foot, residents in the city’s Lower Ninth Ward awoke to assess the damage.

This neighbourhood bore some of the worst scars of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when New Orleans’s levee system failed and submerged the Lower Ninth in a storey of water, sweeping away lives and livelihoods.

That was 16 years ago. But it played heavily on many people’s minds as they hunkered down on Sunday, the anniversary of Katrina’s impact in Louisiana, and braced for another storm.

Wesley Foster, a 74-year-old retiree and lifelong Ninth Ward resident, remembered that time vividly as he watched Ida pound the walls of the home he had rebuilt after Katrina.

He had seen news reports as the storm picked up intensity over the Gulf, eventually making landfall as a category 4 hurricane, one of the most powerful ever to hit the US. “It went from one to two to three, to four so quickly,” he said. “I knew it was going to be bad – but 10 hours of pounding wind …”

He paused.

“It looked like a monster was trying to get inside.”

Foster was not alone in pointing to the storm’s rapidly increasing ferocity, a growing trend in the Atlantic hurricane season that scientists link to the climate crisis.

Ida formed just four days ago out in the Caribbean Sea, intensifying so quickly that officials in New Orleans said they simply did not have the time to order the evacuation of the city.

It came ashore with 150mph winds before trudging slowly through New Orleans and into the state’s capital, Baton Rouge. Quite simply, a storm path born of nightmares.

"What do you think of companies like Nike and Bumble giving staff a week off to 'destress'?

Because of the pressures of the pandemic, Nike has given its head office employees in the US a week off.

The sportswear and trainers brand said workers at its headquarters in Oregon would be “powering down” until Friday, with senior leaders encouraging staff to ignore all work responsibilities to aid their mental health.

“Take the time to unwind, destress and spend time with your loved ones. Do not work,” the Nike senior manager of global marketing science, Matt Marrazzo, said in an open message to staff posted on LinkedIn.

He acknowledged that “this past year has been rough”, adding that staff should recognise that “we’re all human” and living through a traumatic event.

It puts Nike among a growing number of businesses offering extra time off, or concessions around working responsibilities, to combat the burnout caused by home working and constant video calls that have blurred the line between personal and professional lives.

Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of the dating app Bumble, gave her 700 employees an extra week of paid leave to destress and switch off in June.

Beyond its blast walls and razor wire lie millions of dollars more in American military materiel, now in the hands of the Taliban, the enemy US troops went in to fight.

Coalition forces lost more than 3,500 troops over 20 years. The US spent more than $2tn on Afghanistan, more than it contributed to the Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe after the second world war.

As our reporter Ben Doherty writes: ""There was no flourishing of Afghanistan under foreign occupation. More than 47,000 Afghan civilians died in the conflict; millions have fled as refugees to other countries. Afghanistan remains the world’s largest supplier of heroin; the country has consistently been ranked among the world’s least peaceful and most corrupt.

""The best-equipped military in the history of the world, turned out to be no match for the patience of a brutal, unrelenting Taliban.""

"Big oil coined the phrase ‘carbon footprint’ to blame us for their greed – and while climate-conscious individual choices are good, they're not nearly enough to save the planet. More than personal virtue, we need collective action, writes columnist Rebecca Solnit.

In her latest piece for @guardian_us, she looks at how “the very short counterargument that individual acts of thrift and abstinence ... won’t get us the huge distance we need to go in this decade"".

So what do we need to do instead? 

We need to exit the age of fossil fuels, reinvent our energy landscape, rethink how we do almost everything.

"These are four of Notting Hill Carnival's matriarchs - Allyson Williams, Sister Monica Tywang, Lady Lee Woolford Chivers and Kim Woolford.

For decades, each of them helped pioneer and define London's celebration of Caribbean culture - and Europe’s largest street festival.

This year the event, which would normally take place today and tomorrow, has moved online for a second year running after it was cancelled as a result of the pandemic.

Sister Monica Tywang, who has been associated with carnival since 1975, says it was known as the ""annual pilgrimage"".

“We didn’t have the ways of communicating then that we have today, so everybody looked forward to coming to Notting Hill, to meet other Caribbean people and to celebrate our culture.”

London's first carnival was held in 1959 in response to a series of racist attacks and rioting that spread from Nottingham to west London, where white youths targeted black people.

It is now an indelible part of the British cultural calendar - with around a million people usually descending on west London for the celebration.

For carnival institution and “Queen of Mas” Allyson Williams, the event is a family affair. In 1974, she met her husband Vernon there, who founded Genesis, one of Notting Hill’s longest-standing bands, in 1980; since his death in 2002, Allyson has led the band alongside her daughter.

“Marrying a Trinidadian was a dream come true,” she says. “I want my children to understand our legacy: the legacy of slavery, where I came from, to understand the culture of steel band and carnival.”

While technology will do its best to recreate the carnival atmosphere this August bank holiday weekend, the matriarchs are already looking ahead to next year’s event. All have given their lives to a celebration of freedom, one they’re looking forward to returning to without restriction.

"Desperate calls from LGBTQ+ youths contemplating suicide or from their parents after they have made an attempt on their lives often punctuate Alexya Salvador’s day. When they do, she drops everything to talk.

As a transgender woman, she recognises the anguish in their voices. “I feel their pain in my body because I went through this,” she says. “My family went through this.”

As the first transgender reverend in Latin America at the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC), she hopes she can use her faith to help. She understands the struggle to reconcile religion and identity, especially in Brazil, where Christianity reigns and the church is often far from a safe space for those who are LGBTQ+.

According to the National Association of Travestis and Transexuals of Brazil (Antra), 175 trans people were killed in Brazil last year, the highest number since the organisation started collecting data. All were trans women and most, like Salvador, were black and from a low income background. And this year, the violence has continued. In one case, a trans woman was tied up in the boot of a car and beaten by two men with a piece of wood while police watched.

Salvador says long before she became a pastor, it was her faith that provided her with solace and strength. Now, it’s also a way for her to give others in her community the support they need. To read more about her story - and the work she does in her community - click the link in bio.

"Blue whales, the world’s largest mammals, are returning to Spain’s Atlantic coast after an absence of more than four decades.

The first one was spotted off the coast of Galicia in north-west Spain in 2017 by Bruno Díaz, a marine biologist who is head of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute in O Grove, Galicia.

Another was spotted in 2018, another the following year, and then in 2020 they both returned. Just over a week ago a different specimen was sited off the Islas Cíes, near O Grove.

There was a centuries-old whaling industry and a dozen whaling ports in Galicia. Spain did not ban whaling until 1986, by which time the blue whale was all but extinct in the region.

Díaz said it was not yet clear whether the climate crisis was leading the creatures to change their habits and return to the area out of a form of homesickness, or ancestral memory. Researchers believe this type of folk memory, or cultural knowledge, exists in many species and is key to their survival. However, not everyone sees the whales’ return as good news.

“I’m pessimistic because there’s a high possibility that climate change is having a major impact on the blue whale’s habitat,” Alfredo López, a marine biologist at a Galician NGO that studies marine mammals, told the newspaper La Voz de Galicia.

A typical blue whale is 20-24 metres long and weighs 120 tonnes – equivalent to 16 elephants – but specimens of up to 30 metres and 170 tonnes have been found.

"Joe Biden has warned the masterminds of a double suicide-bomb attack in Kabul that killed 13 US troops and 72 Afghan civilians: “We will hunt you down and make you pay.”

On the darkest day of his presidency, Biden declined to extend his 31 August deadline for the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan but promised to evacuate any American citizens who want to leave.

Two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul’s airport. One explosion took place near an airport entrance and another at a nearby hotel. The Islamic State group later claimed responsibility for the attack.

American forces in Kabul are bracing for more IS attacks while winding up their evacuation mission, US officials say.

Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, head of the US military’s Central Command, told a news briefing, “We believe it is their desire to continue these attacks and we expect those attacks to continue - and we’re doing everything we can to be prepared.”

"World Cup host Qatar has failed to investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers in the past decade, according to a new report.

Amnesty International said the majority of migrant worker deaths in the country are attributed to “natural causes”, cardiac or respiratory failure; classifications which are “meaningless” without the underlying cause of death explained, according to one expert cited. 

As a result, as many as 70% of deaths may be unexplained. “In a well resourced health system, it should be possible to identify the exact cause of death in all but 1% of cases,” the human rights organisation's report said.

The report described the devastating toll on the families of workers who die. Under Qatar law, compensation must be paid where deaths are “caused by the job”, but the failure to properly investigate deaths means work-related causes may not be identified, Amnesty said.

Qatar's treatment of its migrant workforce of 2 million has come under unrelenting scrutiny since it won the right to host next year's competition in 2010. In February, @guardian_sport revealed that more than 6,500 migrant workers from south Asia had died in Qatar in the past decade.

Qatari authorities have claimed that the migrant mortality rate is within the expected range given the workforce size, but epidemiological experts quoted in the report question this claim ""because of the low quality of data available”. They also said that migrant workers – who undergo health tests before departing for Qatar – are generally young, healthy and “in the prime of their lives”.

The right group said intense heat and humidity exposure is likely to be a significant factor and has urged the authorities to put in place better protections for workers.

In response to the report, the Qatar government highlighted its record on labour reforms, including a new minimum wage and the removal of barriers to change jobs.

It claimed to have made significant progress on tackling the effects of heat stress and said injury and mortality data were in line with international best practice, setting new standards for the region.

"Sir Lee Pearson has triumphed in the Paralympic dressage - claiming the 12th gold medal of his career. After his victory he was asked by a local journalist about Japanese society not widely accepting or supporting LGBTQ+ rights. This is how he replied:

“Love has to prevail, really. Whatever shape or form, I think love has to prevail. If you’re born with a disability, if you have a child with a disability, if you’re born with same-sex attraction, if your daughter comes out or your son, then just love them.

""Nobody wants to be different but we have to embrace different people because that’s society, that’s the world. Those different people they’re not going anywhere. So you can say it’s illegal, you can make them feel awful, but somewhere in the world another gay boy or girl will be born. Somewhere in the world someone will be born with no limbs. Do you know what I mean? Life goes on and it’s silly in this day and age when we have countries that are still in the stone age, as we say, 100 years behind. But I’m just a horse rider. Promise.”

Some horse rider.

In the stifling Tokyo heat, Pearson, on the back of a new partner, Breezer, well, breezed home.

The 47-year-old from Cheddleton, Staffordshire, who was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita which causes muscle weakness and contracture of the joints, is the pre-eminent equestrian athlete in the history of Paralympic sport.

By the time the end of this year’s Games comes along, and Pearson has competed in both the team dressage and the individual freestyle test, he could have more gold medals on his own than Germany and the United States (the second and third most successful countries in Paralympic equestrian sport) do between them.

That he is more than that, an icon of disability sport as well as an openly, confidently gay athlete who performs to a global audience and has been out for decades, makes the man unique.

He is, also, ""just a horse rider"".

"These remains belong to a teenager nicknamed Bessé, an ancient Toalean woman who died 7,200 years ago in Indonesia.

Archaeologists discovered ancient DNA in the remains in the Leang Panninge cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi - a find that challenges what was previously known about migration of early humans.

The DNA was extracted from the petrous part of Bessé’s temporal bone, which houses the inner ear.

The discovery, published in the journal Nature, is believed to be the first time ancient human DNA has been discovered in Wallacea, the vast chain of islands and atolls in the ocean between mainland Asia and Australia.

The researchers describe Bessé as a “genetic fossil”. Genetic sequencing showed she had a unique ancestral history not shared by anyone living today, nor any known humans from the ancient past.

Griffith University’s Prof Adam Brumm, who co-led the research, said the intact DNA was a rare find.

“The humid tropics are very unforgiving on DNA preservation in ancient human bones and teeth,” Brumm said.

Bessé is also the first known skeleton belonging to the Toalean culture, a group of hunter-gatherers who lived in South Sulawesi between 1,500 and 8,000 years ago.

She was around 17 to 18 years old at the time of burial. Prehistoric stone tools and red ochre were found alongside her remains. Her grave also contained bones of hunted wild animals.

"Afghanistan’s only boarding school for girls has temporarily relocated to Rwanda, its co-founder has said, just days after a video of her burning class records to avoid Taliban recriminations was widely shared on social media.

Shabana Basij-Rasikh, who escaped Kabul with 250 students and staff, urged the world to “not avert your eyes” from the millions of girls left behind.

“See those girls, and in doing so you will hold those holding power over them to account,” said Basij-Rasikh in a tweet, as she vowed to return to Afghanistan.

Another teacher, Pashtana Durrani, executive director of Learn Afghanistan, who is now in hiding, vowed she would “raise an army, just like the Taliban did – only mine will be of educated determined Afghan women”.

The Taliban leadership has sought to portray itself as more moderate than 20 years ago, when it imposed a brutal rule, stopping women from studying and working. The have insisted women will have the right to both. But reports of women being sent home from their jobs and from universities are exacerbating fears the reality will be very different.

Susannah Hares, a director of the Center for Global Development, predicts a huge drop in school attendance, despite Taliban assurances, in mixed sex schools. Only 16% of schools in Afghanistan are girls-only.

Aid leaders urged the international community to use their leverage of foreign aid to stop a reversal of two decades of hard-won advances in girls education.

When Taliban last held power in 2001, only about 12% of primary-aged girls attended some sort of school, rising to about 50% in 2015, according to an analysis of survey data by the Washington-based thinktank Center for Global Development. In 2020, 39% (3.7 million) of the 9.5 million children attending schools were girls.

"Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked baby on one of rock music’s most iconic album covers – Nevermind by Nirvana – is suing the band, claiming he was sexually exploited as a child.

In a lawsuit filed in a Californian district court against numerous parties, including the surviving members of the band, Kurt Cobain’s widow Courtney Love, and the record labels that released or distributed the album in the last three decades, Elden alleges the defendants produced child pornography with the image, which features him swimming naked towards a dollar bill with his genitalia visible.

Elden, who was four months old when the image was made, says he has suffered “lifelong damages” from the 1991 album cover, including “extreme and permanent emotional distress with physical manifestations”, plus loss of education, wages, and “enjoyment of life”.

The lawsuit claims the image is “sexually graphic”, and says it makes Elden resemble “a sex worker – grabbing for a dollar bill”. It claims Elden was never paid for appearing on the cover, and that his parents never signed a release form for the image, which was shot specifically for the album cover. It has previously been reported that Elden was paid $250.

In 2016, Elden recreated the image with the New York Post newspaper to mark the album’s 25th anniversary, saying: “It’s cool but weird to be part of something so important that I don’t even remember.” That year he also said: “Recently I’ve been thinking, ‘What if I wasn’t OK with my freaking penis being shown to everybody?’ I didn’t really have a choice.”

Robert Fisher, who designed the cover, said the image was inspired by Kurt Cobain seeing a documentary about babies being born underwater. “[He] thought the image would make a cool cover. That vision was a bit too graphic, so we went with the swimming baby instead.”

Elden is seeking damages of at least $150,000 from each of the 15 defendants, plus costs, and asks that the case be tried with a jury. The defendants have not yet responded to the lawsuit, or commented on it publicly.",2021-08-25 14:59:41
"“This is completely unexpected behaviour and has never been seen before in wild tortoises,"" said Dr Justin Gerlach, the director of studies at Peterhouse, Cambridge, after a Seychelles giant tortoise, a species previously thought to be a strict herbivore, was filmed chasing and eating a baby bird in a “horrifying and amazing” attack.

It was captured on film by researchers who say it was the first documented example of deliberate hunting in the wild by the species.

The graphic video, taken on Fregate Island in July 2020, shows a female giant tortoise slowly stalking a lesser noddy tern chick, snapping at it unsuccessfully before delivering a lethal bow.

Researchers think this new hunting behaviour has been driven by the unusual combination of a tree-nesting tern colony and a resident giant tortoise population on Seychelles’ Fregate island, which is privately owned, managed for ecotourism and home to about 3,000 giant tortoises.

"The record-shattering rainfall that caused deadly flooding across Germany and Belgium in July was made up to nine times more likely by the climate crisis, according to research.

The new study also showed that human-caused global heating has made downpours in the region up to 20% heavier. Last month, parts of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia were inundated with 148 litres of rain per sq metre within 48 hours in a part of Germany that usually sees about 80 litres in the whole of July.

The flooding in Germany and Belgium killed at least 222 people and caused massive damage.

The new study, which focused on the region around two areas that were particularly badly affected: the German districts by the Ahr and Erft river, was conducted by Prof Maarten van Aalst at the University of Twente, in the Netherlands and 38 other scientists.

They used meteorological measurements, high resolution computer models and peer-reviewed research methods to compare the frequency of extreme rainfall like that behind the flooding in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in today’s heated climate with the frequency expected in a world where there had been no human-caused climate change.

The work reinforces the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s landmark report this month that there is “unequivocal” evidence that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause of worsening extreme weather.

“The huge human and economic costs of these floods are a stark reminder that countries around the world need to prepare for more extreme weather events, and that we urgently need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid such risks from getting even further out of hand,” van Aalst said.

In recent months there has been devastating flooding in western Europe and China, extreme heatwaves in north-west America and forest fires in Russia, Greece, Turkey and the US.

"Never get in the way of an olive sea snake during breeding season.

Researchers from three Australian universities working on the southern Great Barrier Reef found that the snakes - particularly males - approached divers, coiled around fins, struck at camera reflections, and made fast, jerky movements during breeding season.

The acts of aggression are likely because of ‘mistaken identity during sexual interactions’, the scientists wrote in their new study - adding that the snakes, it seems, may believe divers are rivals or potential mates.

And because large olive sea snakes have the capacity to bite human victims and pack a deadly venom, the stakes for divers are very high.

As they get older, they show signs of declining muscle function and appetite, but it appears that no matter their age they can remember what they ate, where and when, and use this to guide their future feeding decisions, said the lead study author, Dr Alexandra Schnell from the University of Cambridge.

This is in contrast to humans, who gradually lose the ability to remember experiences that occurred at a particular time and place with age – for instance, what you ate for lunch last Wednesday. This “episodic memory” and its deterioration is linked to the hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped organ in the part of the brain near our ears. Cuttlefish, meanwhile, do not have a hippocampus, but a “vertical lobe” associated with learning and memory.

"From @guardian_us: In 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan and, after an unprecedented 20 years of conflict, the world has now been witnessing its disastrous, heartbreaking, and almost inevitable conclusion.

Over the last two decades America has spent an estimated $2.26tn on the war. At least 47,245 Afghan civilians have been killed, along with 66,000 members of the Afghan national military and police, 2,448 US service members, 3,846 US contractors, 444 aid workers and 72 journalists.

Today the Taliban is back in charge and ready to turn back the clock by imposing their draconian interpretation of religious law onto the country.

And after almost 20 years, the militant group's capture of Kabul happened in less than a week, making its status as the longest conflict in US history even more head-spinning.

To read what our panel of academics, authors and journalists think about the end of the conflict, follow the link in our bio.

"These self portraits tell the powerful story of @marvelharris's gender reassignment surgery, as well as confronting his struggles with autism and depression.

In adolescence Harris, a Dutch photographer, experienced depression and gender dysphoria which provoked eating disorders and self-harm.

In 2017, he embarked on gender transition and documented every stage of that process in a series of self-portraits, which are painful to witness and profoundly affecting.

Marvel, now 26, started taking his self-portraits, he says, because he found it “really difficult to express what was going on in my mind”.

Later, when he shared the pictures with therapists and friends, they encouraged him to put them online, to help others who might recognise themselves in his images.

Marvel, a book of his pictures, is the winner of this year’s Mack first book award. This deeply personal book demands a more tolerant attitude from society towards transgender people and those who don’t identify as entirely male or female.

Harris says: ‘At first the focus of my project was my gender transition, but along the way I found out that it’s about an ongoing search for myself.’

"Would you eat this 3D-printed 'steak'?

As record numbers of people are opting for a 100% plant-based diet, the demand for meat substitutes has risen.

Spanish start-up Novameat is behind these meat alternative - 3D-printed 'steaks' - which they hope will reach the mass market next year.

""It didn't have the feeling of a traditional steak but I was positively surprised because I did not expect that the texture would be so well achieved,"" said Ferran Gregori after trying one of the printed 'steaks' at a technology conference.

"""It’s traumatising for my generation to see history repeating itself,"" says Khalida Popal, the former Afghanistan women’s national team captain.

After years of elevating the voices of female footballers in her country, Popal is now urging players to delete their social media accounts, erase their public identities and even burn their kits to remain safe in the wake of the Taliban’s seizure of power.

Speaking to @guardian_sport she said: “For so long I have been fighting to bring visibility to women of Afghanistan and to encourage women of Afghanistan to use their voices. Now I’m telling them to silence that voice, to not talk, to not meet people, to take everything down, to remove their identities. That is very painful.""

Claims that the Taliban have softened their approach are hugely concerning to Popal, who had her right to an education taken away by the militant group in the 1990s, saw her mother’s right to work taken away and her father beaten for working with the government.

Human Rights Watch has similarly urged caution and said that the Taliban should be judged “on their track record, not their current comments that they will allow women to work and participate in society”.

Now, Popal and her former international teammates and coaching staff are calling for the sporting community to join them in “being a voice for the voiceless women of Afghanistan”.

"This is the reality on the ground in Afghanistan.

A crying baby being handed over the perimeter wall of Kabul's airport - a member of the American army raising them over the barbed wire fencing. We don't know what happened next - or if this family were able to escape together - but we do know it is yet another show of the desperate attempts being made to flee Taliban rule.

With the militant group now in almost total control of Afghanistan – the Panjshir Valley the notable exception – and in charge of all of the country’s land borders, the capital's airport is the only practicable way out of the country.

The road to the airport – crowded, chaotic and punctuated by regular gunfire – is the has proved impassable to many trying to reach military evacuation flights. Despite Taliban assurances that those seeking to leave the country would be granted “safe passage”, militant fighters blocked the gates to the airport, letting few through, and beating and shooting at some who tried to pass.

Many Afghans fear that their past work with westerners makes them prime targets for retribution. Prior to Afghanistan falling to Taliban control, more than 300 Afghan interpreters and their relatives were killed by militants because of their US ties, according to the non-profit organisation No One Left Behind.

The urgency of the evacuation of those allied with US and Nato forces, and western media organisations, was further compounded by growing reports of Taliban fighters going door-to-door looking for those who had worked with the previous regime, and threatening them into joining the Taliban. This manhunt was despite the group promising just days ago that they would seek “no revenge”.

There is no accurate figure of the number of people – Americans, Afghans or others – who are in need of evacuation as the process is almost entirely self-selecting. It is estimated to be around 11,000 to 15,000 US citizens and dual US-Afghan citizens along with family members, as well as tens of thousands of Afghans who may also be at risk.

"Swipe along to see what's left in Grizzly Flat, a small northern California forest town leveled by the Caldor fire on Tuesday.

Streets in the town of about 1,200 people were littered with downed power lines and poles. Houses were reduced to smoldering ash and twisted metal with only chimneys rising above the ruins. As you can see in the third photo, all that remained of the local church were its chairs, still all neatly lined up amid the ruin. A post office and elementary school were also destroyed, and two people were admitted to the hospital with serious injuries.

Thousands more structures still lay in the path of the fast-moving fire. The blaze was still 0% contained on Wednesday, with crews desperately working to contain the damage.

The destruction in Grizzly Flats came as dangerously dry and windy weather continued to fuel huge blazes across the American west and prompted the nation’s largest utility to begin shutting off power to tens of thousands of customers.

"These are the best-preserved human remains ever discovered in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii.

The remains of Marcus Venerius Secundio were found in a tomb at the necropolis of Porta Sarno. The tomb is believed to date back to the decades before Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD79.

The discovery even includes Secundio’s white hair and a partially visible ear. Initial tests show he died at about the age of 60.

Secundio was a slave and the custodian of ancient Pompeii’s Temple of Venus. After being freed from slavery, he rose though the social ranks and joined the Augustales, a college of priests who were in charge of a form of emperor worship.

An inscription dedicated to Secundio on a marble slab at the top of the tomb makes references to theatre performances in Pompeii that were conducted in Greek.

The fact that he was buried in a tomb proves he succeeded in achieving a good social and economic position.

Pompeii was very well preserved underneath the blanket of ash from the eruption, and was discovered, frozen in time, in the 1700s. Preserved remains of people sheltering from the eruption were found, as well as bakeries with loaves still in the ovens.

"Ellie Cole has won six gold medals. Yet as other women athletes, or sportspeople of colour, or other minorities can attest, success is no shield sometimes.

“You know, six years ago, I was working at a place and I was told that I was a ‘diversity hire,’” she told @guardian_australia from a training camp in Cairns.

The star swimmer believes the comment was made in jest. But she was disappointed. “And I think that’s when I really started asking myself questions about what’s happening outside of the sporting space,” she says. “Because as a prolific athlete, I do live in a bit of a bubble. What’s actually happening out there in the real world needs to be spoken about more.""

Today, the International Paralympic Committee – along with dozens of other major organisations – are launching @WeThe15, which they hope to be the world’s largest human rights movement. The 15 refers to the estimated 15% of people across the globe who have a disability.

The goal of the 10-year campaign, which will be a key feature of the Paralympics Opening ceremony on 24 August, is to “act as a global movement publicly campaigning for disability visibility, accessibility, and inclusion”. Its main message is that: people with disabilities don’t need your pity, they deserve your respect.

When @elliecoleswim was asked by the IPC to take part in the campaign, she thought of her parents. “When they were told that I was going to have my leg amputated at three … their first response was that they felt this overwhelming sense of fear about what my future was going to be like,” Cole says. “They didn’t know anyone else who had a disability.”

As a child, Cole’s parents enrolled her in swimming to help with her rehabilitation. This week, at 29-years-old, she will jet off to Tokyo for her fourth @paralympics.

Cole is the reigning champion in the 100m backstroke S9 and has 15 Paralympic medals to her name – six of them gold.

"Tributes have poured in for the comedian Sean Lock, who has died of cancer at the age of 58.

Celebrated for his carefully crafted surreal content and imaginative observational wit, Lock was nominated for the Perrier comedy award at the Edinburgh fringe in 2000 for his show No Flatley, I am the Lord of the Dance.

He achieved television success with a long run as a team captain on Jimmy Carr’s Channel 4 comedy panel show 8 Out of 10 Cats and the spin-off, 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, and also wrote and starred in the popular BBC sitcom 15 Storeys High. The often deadpan absurdist, whose timing was described by one writer as “second only to the Greenwich Meridian”, toured extensively around the UK.

Bill Bailey told the Guardian that Lock was as “brilliantly funny” off the stage as on, and that their daft conversations would leave him “helpless with laughter”.

His agent, Off the Kerb Productions, said Lock died at home surrounded by his family: “Sean was one of Britain’s finest comedians, his boundless creativity, lightning wit and the absurdist brilliance of his work marked him out as a unique voice in British comedy. Sean was also a cherished husband and father to three children. Sean will be sorely missed by all that knew him.”

Lee Mack, a comedian and close friend, also paid tribute to Lock: “I think the appeal of him as a viewer was that it felt like you were with your mate down the pub and he was making you laugh. I was one of the lucky few that was that mate down the pub and he was making me laugh. A lot. More than almost anyone I’ve ever known.”",2021-08-18 18:02:16

"There are thought to be 640 Afghans in this picture - all packed into a US military cargo plane desperately attempting to flee Kabul after the fall of the capital to the Taliban.

The extraordinary image was obtained by US defence and security news site Defense One. They reported that flight had not intended to take such a large load but some panicked Afghans pulled themselves on to the plane's half-open ramp.

US defence officials said the passengers – among them women and children – on the flight were safely evacuated from Kabul to Qatar on Sunday.

640 people are believed to have crammed into the C-17 Globemaster III - among the highest number of people ever carried in such an aircraft. The flight was one of several that was able to take off with hundreds on board, and others may have carried even more passengers.

The desperation of many other Afghans was seen at Kabul airport on Monday, as people clung to the side of moving military planes and at least three apparently fell to their deaths from the undercarriage soon after takeoff. Video footage showed hundreds of people running alongside a military carrier as it travelled along the runway.

US forces shut down the airport on Monday in an effort to contain the chaos and crowds. At least seven people were killed during the rush towards the sole remaining exit route out of the country.

The airport - the only feasible route out after the Islamist group took control of the country’s land borders - reopened in the early hours of Tuesday, a US general said, adding that US personnel were now in charge of air traffic control.

Joe Biden has said that US troops in Kabul would stay long enough to evacuate American citizens and eligible Afghan allies, and warned the Taliban there would be a “devastating” response to any attempt to attack or disrupt the operation.

"Joe Biden is facing the biggest crisis of his presidency after the stunning fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban caught his administration flat-footed and raised fears of a humanitarian catastrophe.

As the world saw images of desperate Afghans attempting to flee the country, including people clinging to a US transport plane before takeoff, a defiant Biden insisted he stands “squarely behind” his decision to pull US forces rapidly out of the country while attempting to shift blame for events unfolding there to his predecessor, Donald Trump, and the unwillingness of Afghan forces to fight the extremist insurgent force.

Biden acknowledged that the scenes unfolding in Afghanistan are “gut-wrenching”, particularly for veterans and anyone who has spent time on the ground there. But far from admitting error, he claimed the events of the past few days vindicated his decision because US troops, he said, should not fight a war that Afghan solders are not willing to fight themselves.

Biden had inherited a deal from Trump to withdraw forces by 1 May, he added, leaving him with a choice to either follow through belatedly on the agreement or escalate the conflict by sending thousands of troops into combat.

The Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, ending two decades of a failed experiment to import western-style liberal democracy.

At least seven people were killed amid the chaos at Kabul International Airport yesterday, according to the AP.

Thousands of Afghans mobbed the capital's airport desperate to escape. Those with no option to leave had raced home when they realised the Taliban were arriving to destroy evidence of western or government links. Women without burqas searched for shops where they could buy them. Even hospitals were closed, with at least one desperate woman forced to give birth at home, with a doctor she begged to attend.

In parks and other open areas, people who had fled the Taliban’s advance in other parts of Afghanistan huddled in tents, fearful of a future they had tried and failed to escape.

"Climate activist Greta Thunberg has used an interview with a top style and culture magazine to call out fast fashion companies for “greenwashing”.

In an Instagram post to accompany her appearance on the cover of the first issue of Vogue Scandinavia, the 18-year-old spoke out about the contradiction between mass produced fashion and sustainability.

“Many are making it look as if the fashion industry are starting to take responsibility, by spending fantasy amounts on campaigns where they portray themselves as ‘sustainable’, ‘ethical’, ‘green’, ‘climate neutral’ and ‘fair’,” Thunberg wrote. “But let’s be clear: This is almost never anything but pure greenwashing.""

She also called out the fast fashion industry for being a huge contributor to the climate emergency as well as its impact on exploited workers and communities around the world.

Her interview with Vogue Scandinavia was published after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's damning report on Monday, which showed a critical global heating threshold of 1.5C may be breached far earlier than previously expected, potentially within a decade.

"The rent is too damn high.

A two-bedroom rental – a reasonable size for a family – would stretch the budgets of renters in most US counties, new data has revealed.

As the map above shows, the percentage of income the average renter needs to spend on a two-bed is very rarely affordable (just look at how few green counties there are).

Shocked? Well there's more: the data also reveals that nearly half of American workers don’t earn enough to afford a one-bedroom rental.

Rents in the US continued to increase through the pandemic, and a worker now needs to earn about $20.40 an hour to afford a modest one-bedroom rental. The median wage in the US is about $21 an hour.

The data, from the National Low Income Housing Coalition (@nlihc), shows that millions of Americans – from Amazon warehouse workers to cab drivers to public school teachers – are struggling to pay rent. For the poorest Americans, market-rate housing is out of reach in virtually all of the country.

About 14% of Americans fell behind on rent payments during the pandemic – roughly double the figure before the pandemic. A federal moratorium on evictions has kept renters from being kicked out of their homes, but the moratorium lapsed last month, only to be extended into early October for those in regions hardest hit by the pandemic.

"Hands masked in thick black oil, this fisher drips toxic globules back into the sea as he pleads with the camera, urging viewers to “share this video”.

In the footage, filmed onboard a small boat, activist Gary Aboud documents an oil spill this week in the Gulf of Paria, off the Caribbean coast of Trinidad.

It is just the latest of many spills that threaten to wreak havoc on the area’s vulnerable marine life and fishing industry.

Aboud, who heads a local environmental watchdog, showed the extent of the spill, which he said stretched for miles, and criticised what he said was a half-hearted clean-up attempt by oil company, Paria Fuel Trading Company Limited.

Fishermen and Friends of the Sea (FFOS) went out to document the spill and filmed a vessel at full throttle apparently attempting to break up the oil layer. “Breaking up the large globs into smaller globs might be less offensive to the eye but it’s equally offensive to us. When you break the oil up, it sinks and goes to the ocean bed, where it will continue to degrade and get into the food chain,"" said Aboud.

Paria said it discovered this spill on Saturday and that a leak along a 12-inch crude pipeline was the cause. In a statement released on Monday, it said: “The spill is contained, and a residual clean-up is ongoing.”

Oil that sinks to the seabed forces fish to migrate, and can reach the food chain. A 2019 study showed unsafe levels of carcinogens in fish caught in the area.

The region’s oil industry has come under increasing fire as the Gulf of Paria has been plagued by spills over the past few years.

Hundreds of homes have been destroyed and nearly 6,000 people were forced to evacuate, the province’s Emergency Management Bureau said on Friday, as reservoirs reach dangerous levels.

It comes weeks after record floods wreaked havoc and killed hundreds in a neighbouring province.

China has been battered by unprecedented rains in recent months, extreme weather that experts say is increasingly common due to global heating.

The country's meteorological administration warned that heavy rainfall was likely to continue until next week, with regions along the Yangtze River, including Shanghai, vulnerable to flooding.

"Happy World Elephant Day! 🐘

Is there anything more joyous than baby elephants?

These photos are from Kenya's first Indigenously owned and run sanctuary for orphaned elephants.

Established in 2016, the Reteti sanctuary rescues and rehabilitates young orphan elephants, who arrived as a result of human-elephant conflict, drought-related issues and, in one rare case, poaching.

They are nursed back to health, then sent back to the wild.

It is the beginning of a transformation in the way the Samburu people relate to wild animals.

This oasis isn’t just about saving elephants but about breaking down stereotypes and redefining wildlife management.

The sanctuary is empowering Samburu women such as Sasha L Dorothy, to be the first female elephant keepers in Africa. “Before, I was afraid of wild animals, especially elephants, but now I see them differently,” she says.

Since September 2016, the team at Reteti has rescued more than 35 elephants and returned 10 to the wild.

"It has been termed “the Great Resignation” and a “turnover tsunami”. But whether it is because of a shift in priorities during the pandemic or simply a desire for a change, many people have left their jobs, or are thinking of leaving.

In the US, the department of labour reported a record 4m resignations in April. A Microsoft survey of more than 30,000 workers worldwide revealed that 41% were considering quitting or changing professions this year. In the UK and Ireland, research by the HR software company Personio found 38% of respondents were planning to quit in the next six to 12 months.

But how do you know if you are in desperate need of change or just in a pandemic funk. Here are 17 questions to ask yourself to help you clarify your thinking – and your future.

"This is the moment one house was entirely swept after flooding and mudslides caused by heavy rainfall hit Turkey's northern coast. 

Entire villages were left without power while cars were swept away in raging torrents on Wednesday. 

The floods hit the Black Sea coastal provinces of Bartin, Kastamonu, Sinop and Samsun. Officials have said at at least one person has been killed with others missing or injured.

Turkey has been grappling with drought and a rapid succession of natural disasters that world scientists believe are becoming more frequent and violent because of the climate crisis. 

The downpours along Turkey’s northern coast as areas in the country's south have battled wildfires for two weeks.

"Coca-Cola bottles and cans were the most prevalent branded litter on beaches in the UK, a report has found - with campaigners calling on the government to get on with introducing a deposit return scheme for packaging.

Almost two-thirds (65%) of all branded packaging pollution across the nation's coastline can be traced back to just 12 companies, according to the findings by the marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage (SAS).

These are Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, AB InBev, McDonald’s, Mondelēz International, Heineken, Tesco, Carlsberg Group, Suntory, Haribo, Mars and Aldi.

In total 3,913 volunteers collected branded items over 11,139 miles, making it the UK’s biggest coordinated cleanup event. SAS recorded a total of 9,998 branded items that were linked to 328 companies.

A spokesperson for Coca-Cola said: “Like everyone, we care about reducing packaging waste and we don’t want to see any of our packaging end up where it shouldn’t ... It’s disappointing to see any packaging being littered and that’s why we support the introduction of a well-designed deposit return scheme, which would encourage people to recycle rather than litter or throw away.""

Many companies say that a lack of a good deposit return scheme (DRS) in the UK means the packaging of their products gets needlessly littered.

There are plans for such a scheme in Britain, but this has been delayed until 2024 – with the government blaming the Covid-19 pandemic.

In a DRS consumers are charged an additional deposit fee when they buy a drink in a single-use container. This deposit acts as an incentive to support recycling because it is redeemed when the consumer returns the empty container to a return point.

Do you support the idea of deposit return schemes?

"The UK government have opened the door to expanding the use of animal testing to ingredients used in cosmetic products for the first time in 23 years, an animal welfare charity has said.

Cruelty Free International (CFI) said animal testing on ingredients exclusively used in cosmetics – which was banned in the UK in 1998 – could be required, after being told by the Home Office that the government had “reconsidered its policy.”

In a letter, the government said it was aligning itself with a decision made last year by the appeals board of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which said that some ingredients used only in cosmetics needed to be tested on animals to ensure they were safe.

The Home Office insisted that UK law on animal testing had not changed, but campaigners warned that accepting the ECHA’s ruling could lead to a much wider use of animal testing.

The ECHA ruled that German chemicals firm Symrise had to carry out animal tests on two ingredients used solely in cosmetics to satisfy chemicals regulations, overruling EU restrictions on animal testing of cosmetic ingredients. The ingredients are widely used across a range of cosmetics.

In a letter sent to CFI and seen by the Guardian, the Home Office said it aimed to “publicly clarify its position now with the formal publication of an updated policy and regulatory guidance”.

CFI’s director of science and regulatory affairs, Dr Katy Taylor, told our science correspondent, Natalie Grover: ""This decision blows a hole in the UK’s longstanding leadership of no animal testing for cosmetics and makes a mockery of the country’s quest to be at the cutting edge of research and innovation, relying once again on cruel and unjustifiable tests that date back over half a century.”

In response, a government spokesperson said there had been no change in legislation and that the ban on using animals for the testing of finished cosmetic products remained in force.

A 2020 survey from UK charity Frame found that 84% of respondents would not buy a cosmetics product if they knew it, or one of its ingredients, had been tested on animals.

"New York governor Andrew Cuomo has resigned following an investigation by the state attorney general that found he sexually harassed multiple women, most of whom worked for him, and also retaliated after some made complaints.

The Democratic governor had lost the support of the party establishment, with Joe Biden calling on Cuomo to resign following a damning report by the New York attorney general last week. 

Cuomo’s own No 2, the New York lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, had called his conduct “repulsive and unlawful”.

Cuomo had initially stood defiant on the day the New York attorney general, Letitia James, had announced the findings of a five-month investigation in which she concluded he had harassed 11 women and violated civil law against workplace misconduct.

The 63-year-old governor issued a video address shortly after James issued the report of the investigation, on Tuesday 3 August, in which he said: “I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances” and added “It’s just not who I am.

But his political future was dangling by a thread amid moves to impeach and force him from office by the New York legislative assembly.

"At a stable in rural New York, traumatized soldiers and horses are teaching each other to leave the past behind.

The photograph above is of Phil Wytrwa, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, and wild mustang, Tango at the EquiCenter, a therapeutic equestrian facility.

There, under the supervision of a horse trainer, Wytrwa is one of 16 veterans who have sought reprieve from post-traumatic stress among one of the most unpredictable animals: wild mustangs.

The stable runs a program that matches veterans with mustangs to train in hopes the animals can be adopted or utilized as therapeutic partners. Training the horses serves as a kind of therapy, helping veterans rebuild their own confidence, focus and sense of purpose.

Wytrwa described a life transformed by this work. When he returned from Afghanistan, symptoms of PTSD hounded his daily life: flashbacks made it impossible to work and his depression was incapacitating.

“It has helped me immensely,” he said. By focusing on taking care of the animals, he says he was able to become better at taking care of himself. Over time he became more patient, more present with his fiancée and children. “It’s the horses – they did this. They did all of it,” Wytrwa added.

Luann Van Peursem, who received the Air Force commendation medal for saving two men during a rocket attack in Iraq, is pictured on slide five. She first started coming for riding lessons in 2014 when nightmares, flashbacks and depression were consuming her life. “Coming back from Iraq, you just don’t have a lot of trust in mankind, and you just kind of isolate,” she said.

Working with a frightened animal forces the veterans’ nervous behavior to shift in the opposite direction: Confidence and calm are necessary to put the horse at ease. “That connection lets your anxiety relax – because the horses feed off of you. If you’re tight, they’re going to be tight,” Van Peursem said. Her work with the horses has been so helpful that she went so far as to say, “I wouldn’t be alive without it.”

"This is Kiritimati or Christmas Island - a coral atoll - which is part of Kiribati, a remote and low-lying nation in the Pacific Ocean.

Experts have warned places like this could be lost entirely due to the climate crisis. They've said global heating above 1.5C will be “catastrophic” for Pacific island nations and within the century we may see the loss of entire countries due to sea level rise.

Significant parts of places like Kiribati, as well as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands could become uninhabitable if greenhouse gas emissions aren't halved to limit heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels as outlined in yesterday's IPCC landmark report on the climate crisis.

The Pacific has long suffered from king tides, catastrophic cyclones, increasing salinity in water tables making growing crops impossible, sustained droughts, and the loss of low-lying islands to sea level rise. These crises are expected to increase in frequency and severity as the world heats.

Satyendra Prasad, Fiji’s ambassador and permanent representative to United Nations, admitted the IPCC report ""is very alarming"" but added that the impact of global heating had been felt across the Pacific for years.

Joseph Sikulu, Pacific managing director of climate activist group 350.org, also described the IPCC report as ""sobering ... but not unexpected."" He points out that the recent devastating real-world examples of the climate crisis playing out around the world, wildfires in the US, heatwaves in Canada, fires in Siberia, Turkey, and Greece, floods in China, are things that the Pacific has been warning about for years.

""The conversation is shifting, everybody is now understanding the reality of the climate crisis, that’s why it’s import to centre frontline communities more than ever.”

"What can you do if you can't hug the newest member of your family?

New parents in Japan have one interim solution ... they have been sending bags of rice that weigh the same as their newborn babies to relatives who are unable to visit them due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The bags come in a wide range of designs, with some shaped like a baby wrapped in a blanket so that loved ones can feel as though they are hugging the new arrival while looking at a picture of their face, which is attached to the front.

The price of the bag increases in parallel with the size of the baby; some firms charge one yen a gram, with a 3.5kg pack priced 3,500 yen (£22.90).

Naruo Ono, the owner of Kome no Zoto Yoshimiya rice shop says they first had the idea about 14 years ago when their own son was born; ""I was thinking about what I could do for relatives who lived far away and couldn’t come and see him. So we decided to make bags of rice that were the same weight and shape as the baby, so relatives could hold them and feel the cuteness.""

Ono has since expanded the product range to include wedding-themed celebration rice bags. The wedding rice bags have ended up becoming even more popular than the birth ones.

“During the pandemic, the demand for them has really increased as people haven’t been able to travel to wedding ceremonies,” added Ono.

"Karel August Pekelharing, was a gay artist, who, when World War II broke out, joined the Dutch resistance, and worked to sabotage the Nazi persecution of the Jews by forging ID papers and helping them to hide.

In March 1944, he took part in a daring raid on the Weteringschans prison with the aim of freeing resistance fighters. The attack failed. A week later he was arrested and tortured. In June 1944 he and six fellow fighters were executed.

He has now been honoured in Amsterdam with a Stolpersteine or ""stumbling stone"" - a brass memorial plaques embedded in the street that call on passers-by to remember individual victims of the Nazi genocide and oppression, a mental “stumbling” that forces pedestrians to reckon with the past.

The Netherlands has about 8,500 Stolpersteine, but this is the first of four in the country to commemorate Jews and resistance fighters who were known to be gay. Another of the stones remembers Mina Sluijter, a seamstress who was arrested in July 1942, as the deportation of Dutch Jews was starting. Her police file states she was “in detention for homosexuality … also Jewish”. She was murdered at the Auschwitz concentration camp two months later.

Local activists believe gay victims of Nazi persecution have been overlooked. “We thought it was very sad that these people, who often didn’t have any children or partners or relatives who could request a Stolperstein for them just disappeared. We wanted to give them a name,” said Philip Tijsma, a spokesman for COC Netherlands, the LGBTQ+ rights group founded in 1946 by former resistance workers.

Seeing the first four Stolpersteine laid was “quite an emotional moment,” Tijsma said. “Because you are standing in front of the houses were they lived until just the day before they were either transported to Auschwitz or Sobibor to be destroyed, or were shot … That’s the thing about the Stolperstein; it brings history very close, it makes it almost tangible, this is where they walked, on this very sidewalk.”

"As a verdict on the climate crimes of humanity, the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report could not be clearer: we're guilty as hell.

The repeatedly ignored warnings of scientists over past decades have now become reality. Humanity, through its actions, or lack of action, has unequivocally overheated the planet. Nowhere on Earth is escaping rising temperatures, worse floods, hotter wildfires or more searing droughts.

The future looks worse. “If we do not halt our emissions soon, our future climate could well become some kind of hell on Earth,” says Prof Tim Palmer at the University of Oxford.

"This is Geronimo and right now he's probably the world's most famous alpaca. Here's why: the six-year old animal is facing a death sentence after twice testing positive for bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a deadly respiratory disease that has blighted the countryside for decades.

The row over his fate has captured the public’s imagination – with a petition to save him gathering nearly 100,000 signatures, celebrity backing and his friendly, furry face splashing British newspaper front pages. But vets have cautioned that the law is clear: Geronimo the alpaca must be put down.

Owner Helen Macdonald, a veterinary nurse who runs an alpaca farm in Gloucestershire, first brought Geronimo to the UK from New Zealand four years ago, when he tested positive on arrival. Since then, she says she has spent £80,000 exhausting legal avenues trying to save him.

Despite the campaigning, the environment secretary George Eustice has wrote that culling animals for bTB was an “arduous but necessary endeavour” and that Geronimo’s positive tests, which Macdonald disputes, are a “very strong indicator of the presence of the disease”.

Vets have said being an alpaca does not give Geronimo an exemption from rules that apply to all animals.

Sarah Tomlinson, a farm vet and bTB expert who sits on Defra’s Bovine TB Partnership, said: ""Ultimately it is a notifiable disease, and we have quite specific laws around notifiable diseases because they have either impacts on animal health and welfare, impacts on international trade – so if we have it we can’t trade – and also for public health reasons.”

Notifiable diseases are usually highly contagious infections that can spread to humans, especially when animals are in regular close contact with people. Macdonald has vowed to “stand in the way of any gunman who comes to destroy Geronimo” and insists that he poses no risk to other animals or humans.

"“​​It is unequivocal.”

Those three words are the first in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s new report - their starkest warning yet on global heating.

It has laid out how the climate crisis is unequivocally caused by human activities and is unequivocally affecting every corner of the planet’s land, air and sea already.

The report, produced by hundreds of the world’s top scientists and signed off by all the world’s governments, says within the next two decades temperatures are likely to rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels bringing widespread devastation and extreme weather.

The collapse of major Atlantic currents, ice caps, or the Amazon rainforest “cannot be ruled out”, the report warns.

António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, warned: “[This report] is a code red for humanity. The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable: greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk.”

But the report is clear that there are no cliff-edges to the climate crisis. Each tonne of carbon pumped out increases the impacts and risks of extreme heat, floods and droughts and so every tonne of carbon matters. It will never be too late to act, the report shows. Instead, the real question is how bad will it get?

There are around 20 animal sanctuaries in the country where employees and volunteers are connected via WhatsApp - sharing veterinary information and coordinating animal rescues for cows, bulls, pigs, sheep and geese.

Rather than being killed for meat or shackled for dairy production, these animals are fed and exercised, given medicine if they’re sick, rehabilitated if they’re injured and, the main privilege denied to most farm animals, allowed to live long lives.

In a thrilling match that went all the way to penalties, Canada defeated Sweden at the Yokohama Stadium; the country's first ever gold medal in football.

@thequinny5 won bronze with Team Canada in Rio in 2016, but they hadn’t yet come out. Last year, they announced they were transgender, that they use they/them pronouns and that they would take Quinn as their full name, saying on Instagram: “I want to be visible to queer folks who don’t see people like them on their feed. I know it saved my life years ago.”

Speaking to Canadian news outlet CBC, after winning gold with their teammates on Friday, Quinn said; “I’m so proud of my team. They’re my best friends. I’m so glad we’re bringing back a better medal than bronze.""

In Tokyo, Quinn is one of at least three transgender and/or non-binary athletes competing. New Zealand’s Laurel Hubbard, a transgender woman, competed in the 87kg weightlifting - and Alana Smith, a non-binary skateboarder, competed in the women’s street competition. Chelsea Wolfe, a trans woman, also traveled to Tokyo with Team USA to the BMX competition as an alternate.

Quinn was the first of the trans and non-binary athletes to compete in Tokyo. Writing about their feelings at the start of the historic games, they said on Instagram: ""I feel proud seeing ‘Quinn’ up on the lineup and on my accreditation. I feel sad knowing there were Olympians before me unable to live their truth because of the world.

"Does this stat change your mind about bottled tap water?

Scientists in Barcelona have found the impact of bottled water on natural resources is 3,500 times higher than for tap water.

The research is the first of its kind and examined the impact of bottled water in the Spanish city, where it is becoming increasingly popular despite improvements to the quality of tap water in recent years.

Research led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) found that if the city’s population were all to drink bottled water, this would result in a 3,500 times higher cost of resource extraction than if they all drank tap water, at $83.9m (£60.3m) a year.

Researchers also found the impact of bottled water on ecosystems is 1,400 times higher than tap water.

The lead author of the study, Cristina Villanueva, said: “Health reasons don’t justify the wide use of bottled water. Yes, strictly speaking, drinking tap water is worse for local health, but when you weigh both, what you gain from drinking bottled water is minimal. It’s quite obvious that the environmental impacts of bottled water are higher compared to tap water.”

In the US, 17m barrels of oil are needed to produce the plastic to meet annual bottled water demand. Villanueva said people trusted bottled water because advertisers have done a good job of convincing people. ""So we need the effort on the other side.”

It is being used on students to monitor engagement in lessons, in marketing to sense enjoyment, and there are reports that China is using it on Uyghur Muslims in the region of Xinjiang.

Luke Stark (@thestarkcontrast), a @westernuniversity assistant professor and researcher into the ethical and social impacts of artificial intelligence, explains how the technology is already being used, exactly how it works, and how worried we should be.

"At least 150 houses have been destroyed by a raging fire that surrounded a monastery and a dozen villages on the Greek island of Evia, one of over 100 blazes burning in the country.

“We’re waging a battle of the titans!” deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias told journalists. “The hardest is still to come.”

On the island, some 200km (125 miles) away from the capital Athens, the huge flames leaping up from the forest could be seen from the sea.

In the image above one man was photographed spraying water on a burning olive press factory in the village of Rovies.

Firefighters said it was a difficult blaze to control on an island of rolling hills with little visibility, but that everyone had been evacuated from nearby villages except three monks from Saint David Monastery who had refused to leave.

“We’re suffocating due to the smoke,” one of the monks told the ANA news agency by phone, describing flames 30 to 40 metres (100 to 130 feet) high surrounding the monastery. Police told AFP they would force the monks to evacuate if their lives were in danger.

Firefighters were also continuing to battle a blaze near Athens on Thursday morning, while the mayor of Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, pleaded for help as flames threatened the site.

According to Hardalias, Greece has faced a total of 118 fires in the last 24 hours as temperatures soared above 40C (104F).

Authorities have described the heatwave as the worst in the country since 1987.

Experts have warned that global heating is increasing both the frequency and intensity of such fires.

"Though the Tuatara is slow-moving, the ancient reptiles have surprised researchers ... why you ask? With their fast-moving sperm.

The discovery came amid a new effort by scientists to gather and preserve the sperm of the protected at-risk species, to try to ensure it survives new threats and a warming planet.

Tuatara, unique to New Zealand, sometimes take 16 months to hatch, and 35 years to reach full size of about 0.5m.

They can then live and reproduce until they are more than 100 years old – in 2008, Henry the Tuatara became a first-time father at the age of 111.

But researchers said they were shocked to discover that tuatara sperm are the fastest swimmers of any reptile studied to date.

They think the speed could be because, unlike most other reptiles, Tuatara don't have penises, so their sperm swim four times faster than other reptiles to aid delivery. They reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his cloaca, or genital orifice, over hers.

Today, their existence is being threatened further by global heating. That's because their sex is determined by the temperature Tuatara eggs are exposed to – warmer temperatures mean more males hatch.

As the planet warms, scientists warn that more and more male hatchlings will be produced, skewing sex ratios. If populations are too male-dominated, they will become functionally extinct.

Now, New Zealand researchers are engaged in a new effort to create an “insurance policy” of frozen sperm, that they could use to replenish populations.

"Prof Sarah Gilbert has had quite a year.

The co-creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab has been made a dame, been given an emotional standing ovation at Wimbledon – and now a 'vaccinologist barbie' doll has been made in her honour.

Gilbert, who led the development of the Covid vaccine at Oxford University, said she initially found the gesture “very strange” but hoped it would inspire young girls to work in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem).

“I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of girls into Stem careers,” she said. “My wish is that my doll will show children careers they may not be aware of, like a vaccinologist.”

As well as the likeness of Dame Sarah, the toy company has created models in honour of five other inspirational women working in Stem around the world.

They include US healthcare workers Amy O’Sullivan and Dr Audrey Cruz, Canadian doctor and campaigner Dr Chika Stacy Oriuwa, Brazilian biomedical researcher Dr Jaqueline Goes de Jesus and Dr Kirby White, an Australian medic who co-created a reusable gown for frontline staff.

"On 4 August 2020, one of the largest non-nuclear blasts in history destroyed much of Beirut's port area, killing at least 210 people and injuring more than 6,000 others.

One year on, the Lebanese capital remains a shell of a city; while most of the physical damage has been repaired, the scar on Beirut’s psyche remains raw and festering, its impact intensified by the anger of a people denied justice.

The explosion is believed to have been caused by an estimated 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse. The investigation into the blast has flatlined, and its perpetrators are as far away from accountability as ever.

Even worse, the global aid pledged in the wake of the destruction remains forsaken by Lebanon's rulers, who prefer the narrow privileges that flowed to them from a crippled system to a global rescue plan that could save the country.

"This is John Eyers, a father of one.
He was 42, ""fit and healthy"", loved climbing mountains and lifting weights.

He has died of Covid after refusing to get the vaccine, leaving his twin sister and mother heartbroken and warning others not to think they are immortal to the dangers of the virus.

Eyers, a construction expert from Southport in Merseyside in the UK, was described by his sister Jenny McCann as “the fittest, healthiest person I know”. She added that her brother had been climbing Welsh mountains and wild camping four weeks before his death.

But he was left in intensive care after catching coronavirus, telling his consultant before he was ventilated that he wished he had been vaccinated.

His twin said her brother’s death was “a tragedy”. She had told her followers in a tweet a month earlier that her brother had asthma.

“He thought if he contracted Covid-19 he would be OK. He thought he would have a mild illness. He didn’t want to put a vaccine on his body. His was pumped full of every drug in the hospital. They threw everything at him,” McCann said on Twitter.

“It should not have happened. He leaves a mum and a dad, a sister (me), and a 19-year-old daughter. My two children have lost their fun uncle. The uncle who would always play with them.”

McCann said her brother had dressed up as Father Christmas for her children. “My mum has lost her baby boy. My niece, her much loved and needed dad. This shouldn’t have happened. My mum wants people to know about John. For his story to save someone’s life. For the pain and loss to drive people to get a vaccine.”",2021-08-04 19:00:07
"12, 19 and 13.

Those are the ages of the silver, gold and bronze Olympic medallists in the women’s skateboard park event at Tokyo 2020.

In a whirlwind of handplants, nose grinds, aerials, leaps, twists, spins, and flips, Sakura Yosozumi, Kokona Hiraki and Sky Brown claimed the top three spots at the Ariake Urban Arena.

It was acrobatics at a hundred miles an hour.

Yosozumi, 19, won the gold medal in front of her home crowd, saying: ""I won gold because I enjoyed the competition. I had so much fun. I did all the tricks altogether. The relaxed atmosphere was the key.""

Her compatriot 12-year-old Hiraki finished second to become the youngest Olympic medallist in 85 years.

She is six-weeks younger than Sky Brown, 13, who after falling in her first two runs of the final, nailed her last attempt to claim bronze, making her the youngest medallist in British history.

After the event, Brown, who was born in Miyazaki, Japan, to a Japanese mother and British father a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, said: ""I am so happy. It's insane to be here. I am so happy to be on the podium with these guys. They are so amazing. Everyone ripped. I am honestly just happy be in Tokyo. But getting on the podium is insane.""

"In a rarely seen phenomenon in the monkey world, a nine-year-old female known as Yakei has become the boss of a 677-strong troop of Japanese macaques at a nature reserve on the island of Kyushu in Japan.

Yakei’s path to the top began in April when she beat up her own mother to become the alpha female of the troop at the Takasakiyama natural zoological garden in Oita city.

While that would have been the pinnacle for most female monkeys, Yakei decided to throw her 10kg weight around among the males. In late June, she challenged and roughed up Sanchu, the 31-year-old alpha male who had been leader of “troop B” at the reserve for five years.

Surprised wardens at Takasakiyama, where there has never been a female monkey boss in the reserve’s 70-year history, carried out a “peanut test” on 30 June, putting out nuts for the group and seeing who ate first. Sanchu backed away and gave Yakei first dibs on the treat, confirming her alpha status.

“Since then, Yakei has been climbing trees and shaking them, which is an expression of power and a very rare behaviour in females,” Satoshi Kimoto, a guide at Takasakiyama, told the Guardian.

Takasakiyama, established as a reserve for monkeys in 1952, is home to about 1,500 macaques, split between troop A and troop B. The monkeys live mainly in the forested mountain at the centre of the reserve, roaming freely and coming down to lower ground for food provided by wardens.

The wild population of Japanese macaque monkeys is estimated to be more than 100,000. They are known to sometimes be aggressive, and hikers, mountain climbers and visitors to the Takasakiyama reserve are advised not to maintain eye contact with them as it is interpreted as a challenge.

"""I did it for me.""

Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast of all time, ended her Olympics with a bronze medal - but after a week in Tokyo it felt like a victory.

The four-time Olympic champion pulled out of the team final due to mental health concerns then also withdrew from the all-around, floor and uneven bars, but her bronze in the beam today tied her with Shannon Miller for the most by a US gymnast at the Olympics on seven.

“It wasn’t easy pulling out of all those competitions,” Biles said after clinching bronze. “People just thought it was easy, but I physically and mentally was not in the right head space and I didn’t want to jeopardize my health and my safety because at the end of the day, it’s not worth it.

Biles added that she is grateful to have had the opportunity to bring the topic of mental health to the fore.

“I think it should be talked about a lot more, especially with athletes, because I know some of us are going through the same things and we’re always told to push through it,” she said. “But we’re all a little bit older now and we can kind of speak for ourselves. At the end of the day, we’re not just entertainment, we’re humans and there are things going on behind the scenes that we’re also trying to juggle with as well on top of sports.”

"New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard made history on Monday night - becoming the first openly transgender woman to compete in the Olympics.

In a rare interview with international media after her appearance in the over-87kg final, which had been the subject of controversy and scrutiny, Hubbard, said: ""We are human and, as such, I hope that just being here is enough.""

""I don't think it should be historic. I think as we move into a new and more understanding world, people are starting to realise that people like me are just people.""

Hubbard, 43, failed with attempts to lift 120kg and two at 125kg in the snatch as she made a quick exit from the competition. China's Li lifted an Olympic record of 320kg to take the gold medal, with Britain's Emily Campbell claiming silver and American Sarah Robles winning bronze.

After the event, Hubbard said she planned to retire from the sport, adding that she had never sought publicity, nor regards herself a role model or trailblazer, but just wants to be treated like any other athlete on sport's biggest stage.

"Young marine turtles are swallowing large quantities of plastic, with ocean pollution changing habitats that were once ideal for their development into a risk, researchers have found.

The animals evolved overtime to develop in the open ocean - areas of the ocean away from the coast and above the seabed - because predators are relatively scarce. But now plastic is now polluting these habitats that were once ideal for their development.

A new study into plastic pollution and young turtles has called this an 'evolutionary trap'.

Writing in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, researchers in the UK and Australia reported how they looked for the presence of plastic in the innards of 121 sea turtles of five species – green, loggerhead, olive ridley, hawksbill and flatback. The turtles were from the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia, and the Pacific Ocean off the east coast of Australia, and were either stranded or caught unintentionally.

The impact of plastic on wildlife is a growing area of study, and researchers have revealed harrowing cases of marine animals sustaining injuries or dying after ingesting such material or becoming entangled in it.

One study estimated that between 4.8m and 12.7m tonnes of plastic entered the world’s oceans in 2010 alone, while a recent review by the Australian government’s science agency, CSIRO, found that animals across 80 different species, including turtles, were being killed by ingesting plastic.

Barshim had a better idea: how about two golds?

The official agreed and the pair of them began to celebrate. Tamberi slapped Barshim’s hand and jumped into his arms before belly-flopping hard on to the track, rolling around a few times and screaming in joy.

“I still can’t believe it happened,” said Tamberi. “Sharing with a friend is even more beautiful. It was just magical.”

""He’s one of my best friends – not only on the track but outside of the track,"" added Barsham. “We’re always together almost. True spirit, sportsmen spirit, coming here and delivering this message. Appreciate what he’s done, he appreciates what I’ve done. This is amazing.""

"Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, an Olympic sprinter from Belarus, has received a humanitarian visa from Poland upon seeking asylum. It comes after she allegedly refused an order to fly home early from Japan for criticising her coaches.

Her husband, Arseniy Zdanevich, fled Belarus for Ukraine, telling Sky News: ""I didn't think it would get this serious. I made the decision to leave without thinking twice.""

Over the weekend, Tsimanouskaya was abruptly removed from competition and spirited to the airport by team officials, but she refused to board the flight back to Minsk and sought police protection.

The 24-year-old posted a video about the ‘negligence’ of her coaches for entering her into the 400m relay at short notice as her teammates hadn’t had the correct doping tests.

Belarusian state media criticised her for lacking ‘team spirit’.

The incident on Sunday highlighted discord in Belarus, a former Soviet state that is run with a tight grip by president Alexander Lukashenko. In power since 1994, he faced a wave of mass street protests last year over what his opponents called rigged elections, which some athletes joined.

"Raising her arms in an “X” shape above her head, Raven Saunders took silver in the shot put and made the first podium protest of the Tokyo Olympic Games.

Saunders, who is black and gay, said the gesture represented “the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet”. The 25-year-old also said she wanted it to help “people all around the world who are fighting and don’t have the platform to speak up for themselves”.

The American athlete has suffered from mental health problems and paid tribute to her “communities” after her silver medal on Sunday. She added that younger people were more open to differences than previous generations.

“I really think that my generation really don’t care,” Saunders said. “At the end of the day, we really don’t care. Shout out to all my black people. Shout out to all my LGBTQ community. Shout out to all my people dealing with mental health. At the end of the day, we understand it’s bigger than us and it’s bigger than the powers that be. We understand that there’s so many people that are looking up to us, that are looking to see if we say something or if we speak up for them.”

Like many other athletes at Tokyo 2020, most notably gymnast Simone Biles, Saunders said she has sometimes struggled with the pressures of elite sport - adding that she had been helped by reaching out to her former therapist.

The International Olympic Committee has banned athletes from protesting on the podium, although they are allowed to “express their views” at press conferences. On Monday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said they were looking into the incident but did not elaborate on what punishment, if any, the American would face.

The shot put was won by Gong Lijiao of China. New Zealand’s Valerie Adams, the 2008 and 2012 champion, won bronze.

"Four dogs, one mission: to sniff-search for mines left by the Islamic State in northern Iraq.

Branco, an eight-year-old Belgian shephard is part of the elite team of canines detecting the underground explosives so that a mine-clearing team can get rid of them.

ISIS produced thousands of these mines when the terror group held sway over this part of Iraq and commandeered plastics factories in their Mosul base.

A single mine, known as VS50, could fit on the palm of your hand, and contains about 100g of explosives. The pressure pad is sensitive enough for a child to activate, even through 30cm of packed earth. The explosion can take out an armoured vehicle.

Branco is trained to sniff ahead in a controlled manner and stop if he gets a scent – so he doesn’t tread on the mine.

Belgian and German shepherds are used because they are most adept at distinguishing scents.

"This is Karapiru Awá Guajá. A man who has lived an extraordinary life and inspired so many along the way.

He survived a massacre that killed most of his family in the Brazilian Amazon and lived for 10 years alone in the forest, but Karapiru could not escape the pandemic.

One of the last of the hunter-gatherer nomadic Awá of Maranhão state, he died of Covid-19 earlier this month. With only 300 Awá thought to remain, they have been called the “earth’s most threatened tribe”.

Survival International, a group working for the rights of indigenous people, describes Karapiru’s “extraordinary warmth and kindness”.

Awá lands have been under attack since the discovery of iron ore in the late 1960s. The scale of the mining development gouged from the Amazon is such that it can be seen from space.

In the 1970s, Karapiru lost almost everyone he knew in a genocidal attack on his tribe by settlers.

After the massacre, Karapiru spent 10 years alone, eating honey, small birds and sleeping in the boughs of copaiba trees and among the orchids.

Marina Magalhães, a linguist studying the Awá language who became friends with Karapiru in 2001 said:

“Karapiru, in my view, represents the best that a human being can become, due to his friendliness and tranquility. Also, an example of how resilient we can be in the most extreme situations.”

"Refugees from seven generations have come together to recreate a photograph of the signing of the UN refugee convention to mark the agreement’s 70th anniversary.

The gathering celebrates decades of the UK granting sanctuary to people fleeing for their lives – but also warns that the nation’s duty towards refugees must continue into the future.

The photo, created by coalition campaign Together With Refugees, brings together refugees from a range of conflicts including the Hungarian uprising, Ugandan Asians who fled Idi Amin’s regime and the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans war. In the place of the UN document, they signed an orange heart, a symbol of support for refugees.

The UN refugee convention 1951 formalised the rights of refugees under international law. It means that countries signed up to it have a legal duty to protect those fleeing persecution and serious harm in other countries. A total of 149 countries have signed up to this law, including the UK.

George Szirtes, 72, who took part in the recreation photograph, is a successful writer who arrived in the UK as a refugee in 1956 at eight years old, having fled from Hungary.

He said: “Giving safety to people fleeing war and persecution was necessary 70 years ago and I suspect it is more necessary now than ever before.”

Enver Solomon, a spokesperson for Together With Refugees and CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “Seventy years ago, after the horrors of the second world war, the UK signed the Refugee convention. We gave our commitment to protect people fleeing war and persecution. Since then, it has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. These are people who have gone on to make huge contributions to our communities as proud Britons. And we must continue to safeguard this promise of safety.”

"Armed with a taxidermied wolf to lure poachers, Rod Coronado hunts down hunters in Wisconsin.

He doesn't use violent tactics however – he gave those up long ago. Instead, he shoots hunters with something much more effective: his camera.

As the founder of Wolf Patrol, Coronado recently captured footage from one of Wisconsin's worst wolf massacres. In less than three days, 216 wolves were killed by hunters using tracking dogs.

The mass killing came after the state handed out 1,548 hunting permits, despite there only being an estimated 1,000 wolves in Wisconsin. It was also the first hunt since the gray wolf was removed from the endangered species list by the Trump administration last fall.

While wolf hunting is legal in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, Wisconsin is the only state that allows the controversial use of tracking dogs – a practice that Wolf Patrol, which has made a habit of following Wisconsin houndsmen through the woods for years, hoped to call attention to by posting their footage of the hunt on YouTube.

“It’s not a sport,” Coronado says. “It’s just killing.”

"This lake is not supposed to be pink. It's not a wonder of nature - it's caused by pollution.

In the Chubut province of Argentina, the dumping of toxic waste from fishing has tinted the lagoon.

Experts and activists blame it on pollution by a chemical used to preserve prawns for export.

The colour is caused by sodium sulfite, an anti-bacterial product used in fish factories.

The lagoon, which is not used for recreation, receives runoff from the Trelew industrial park and has turned the colour of fuchsia before.

Residents in the local area have complained about the foul smells and pollution concerns around the Chibut river which feeds into the Corfo lagoon. In protest against the continued pollution, locals have blocked roads used by fish waste trucks from entering the area.

""The reddish colour does not cause damage and will disappear in a few days,"" environmental control chief for Chubut province, Juan Micheloud, told AFP last week.

"'We wish that was real life’

After the USA’s win against Iran, a mutual feeling of respect and fellowship emerged yesterday.

Sean Ingle, The Guardian's chief sports reporter, is in Tokyo right now - here's a snippet of his analysis from last night's basketball match:

""The players and coaches gave their political leaders a lesson in harmony, decency and class in Tokyo.⁣
⁣
Seeing players from these teams bond during and after their match was enough to melt the heart of even the iciest cynic.⁣
⁣
When US coach Gregg Popovich was asked about the significance of his team and Iran sharing a court together, he hit the nail on the head. “I think people from different countries get along better than their governments,” he said. “People appreciate each other, no matter what country you are talking about. I really believe that. And this is a time where sport transcends all that petty crap you get from governments.”⁣
⁣
Whether this will make any difference to wider US-Iran relations is an entirely different story. But it might at least make leaders stop to reflect.""

US athletes have shown support for gymnastics star Simone Biles after she withdrew from the Olympics to focus on her mental health.

'I can only imagine the immense amount of pressure she is under' said gold medal surfer Carissa Moore, 'she is on every commercial, and billboard, and bag I see, and she is, like, touted as she is gonna win everything, like, how crazy is that? ... she has handled it beautifully.'

"Police officers have described fearing for their lives during the January attack on the US Capitol and living with “constant trauma” during the first hearing of the House investigation into the deadly assault, with prominent Republicans boycotting proceedings in an attempt to undermine any findings.

In harrowing testimony on Tuesday, the officers described being crushed by violent pro-Trump rioters, threatened with their own service weapons, and being targeted with racist abuse.

The special committee established by the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, convened to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 6 January insurrection.

Representative Bennie Thompson said if the committee he chairs can prevent any future attacks on the Capitol, that would be “the most valuable contribution to this great democracy.”

“We must know what happened here at the Capitol,” Congresswoman Liz Cheney, a Trump critic and one of just two Republicans on the select committee, said in opening remarks.

“We must also know what happened every minute of that day in the White House – every phone call, every conversation, every meeting leading up to, during and after the attack. Honorable men and women have an obligation to step forward.”

"“Imagine being out of sight of land, running out of fuel, coming across incredibly busy shipping lanes when you’re frightened and you don’t know which direction you’re going in. That is by anyone’s standards distress. Our role in this is incredible important: simply to respond to a need to save lives,” said Mark Dowie, the chief executive of the UK's Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).

The RNLI has hit out at accusations it is operating a “migrant taxi service” by rescuing people at risk of dying in the water as they cross the English Channel in small boats, which the charity says is its moral and legal duty.

While the charity does not take a stance on political matters, Dowie said: “These islands have the reputation for doing the right thing and being decent societies, and we should be very proud of the work we’re doing to bring these people home safe.”

“I understand it’s a polarising and complex situation,” he said. “But unless you’ve experienced being in an open boat in the waves, it’s quite hard to get a feel for what it must be like.”

RNLI crew members are mostly volunteers and wake up in the middle of the night or leave their regular jobs to rescue people in distress in the sea. Once they return with migrants, they ensure they are safe and well before handing them over to the police and border control officers.

Volunteers shared experiences of “vile abuse” on the beach as they returned with people, including young children, in desperate need of medical attention, such as having beer cans thrown at them and people shouting “fuck off back to France”.

"The Queen’s lawyers secretly lobbied Scottish ministers to change a draft law to exempt her private land from a major initiative to cut carbon emissions, documents reveal.

The exemption means the Queen, one of the largest landowners in Scotland, is the only person in the country not required to facilitate the construction of pipelines to heat buildings using renewable energy.

Her lawyers secured the dispensation from Scotland’s government five months ago by exploiting an obscure parliamentary procedure known as Queen’s consent, which gives the monarch advance sight of legislation.

In a series of reports into Queen’s consent in recent months, the Guardian revealed how the Queen repeatedly used her privileged access to draft laws to lobby ministers to change UK legislation to benefit her private interests or reflect her opinions between the late 1960s and the 1980s.

The new documents, uncovered by Lily Humphreys, a researcher for the Scottish Liberal Democrats using freedom of information laws, disclose how the monarch used her special access to Scottish legislation to intervene in the parliamentary process as recently as February.

The documents also suggest Nicola Sturgeon’s government failed to disclose the monarch’s lobbying this year when a Scottish politician used a parliamentary debate to query why the Queen was securing an exemption from the green energy bill.

The move appears at odds with the royal family’s public commitment to tackling the climate crisis, with Prince William recently joining his father, Charles, in campaigning to cut emissions and protect the planet.

"'There is more to life than just gymnastics.'

The American gymnast Simone Biles, the biggest star at the Tokyo Olympics and the greatest athlete in the sport’s history, has withdrawn from the women’s all-around gymnastics final.

The news followed her dramatic decision to stop competing in the women’s team event on Tuesday after one rotation on the vault, citing mental health concerns.

After withdrawing from the event, Biles admitted that she had struggled with the demands of being one of the most famous athletes in the world, the unique pressure of these Games and the added challenge of being stuck in a Covid secure bubble:

""I say put mental health first because if you don't then you aren't going to enjoy your sport and you aren't going to succeed as much as you want to.

""So, it's OK sometimes to even sit out the big competitions to focus on yourself because it shows how strong of a competitor and person you really are.""

Her decision has been widely praised by America’s sporting superstars, with Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, among those insisting that it would “blow the doors open” over athletes mental health; “I hope this is an opportunity for us to jump on board, and to even blow this mental health thing even more wide open. It is so much bigger than we can ever imagine.""

US gymnastics said Biles will be evaluated before deciding if she will participate in next week’s individual events.

"“I cried tears of happiness because so many people have supported me for a long time,"" said gymnast Oksana Chusovitina after competing in her eighth consecutive Olympic Games this week.

The 46-year-old did not score highly enough to advance in Tokyo this year, but received a standing ovation in what she says will be her last Olympics.

Chusovitina has won 13 world and Olympic medals combined, including a record nine world championship medals on vault, with a silver at Beijing in 2008.

Now, at 46 with a son older than most of her competitors, she's ready to retire: “My son is 22 years old and I want to spend time with him. I want to be a mom and wife,” Chusovitina said.

She has essentially been one of the top eight vaulters in the world throughout most of her career, most recently finishing fourth at the world championships in 2018, aged 44.

Chusovitina’s career has spanned four national teams: the Soviet Union, the United Team in 1992 after the Soviet Union’s demise, her native Uzbekistan, Germany and then Uzbekistan again.

In the midst of her flourishing career, she moved to Germany in 2002 after her son Alisher was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and eventually represented them. Chusovitina kept training during this time because the prize money was a vital source of income. “If I don’t compete then my son won’t live, it’s as simple as that,” she said at the time.

"Tom Dean won gold in the pool for Team GB at the Olympics – and his family and friends enjoyed the moment with a garden party in the middle of the night in the UK.

Six months ago Dean wasn’t sure whether he would even make it to these Olympics. Covid has affected every athlete’s preparations for the Games, but it hit Dean’s more than most. He caught it once, last September, then again in the new year, which he thinks made him the first British Olympian to have it twice.

The second time was the worst, too. He was ill for 10 days, then stuck indoors in isolation, and was unable to train for the best part of a month after that. Altogether it cost him seven weeks of winter training. In those moments alone, languishing in his flat, Tokyo seemed a lot further than a 12-hour flight away.

""It seemed a million miles off,"" Dean said. And now here he is, Great Britain’s first Olympic champion in the men’s 200m freestyle since 1908. He won in a new national record of 1min 44.22sec. His friend and teammate, Duncan Scott, was a fingertip behind him, winning silver to give Great Britain their first one-two in the pool in 113 years.

"A doctor in Alabama has revealed the heartbreaking pleas of her Covid patients to be vaccinated as their conditions worsened.

It's a sad reminder of what the US government is calling “the pandemic of the unvaccinated”, which is playing out in painful ways as some realize too late that they wish they’d had the shot, while others hold out even as they suffer in hospital.

At least 99% of those in the US who died of coronavirus in the last six months had not been vaccinated, according to the CDC.

Meanwhile vaccination rates have slowed down nationwide and are especially low in some of the more conservative, southern parts of the country, despite more than 610,000 people in the US dying of the virus since the pandemic hit in early 2020.

In places such as Alabama, only 33% of people who can receive the vaccine had been fully vaccinated, as of 20 July. Officials recently reported 96% of Alabamians who have died of Covid since April were not fully vaccinated.

Among the people succumbing to the deadly disease are those who are increasingly catching the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which is far more contagious than the original. According to the CDC, Delta is now the dominant strain in the US, making up 83% of new cases.

To be an Olympic champion now just shows that you can achieve anything,"" Tom Daley said after winning Olympic gold with his diving partner Matty Lee for Great Britain.

Daley and Lee had produced a stunning performance in the synchronised 10m platform to take the gold medal by one point ahead of the Chinese pair Cao Yuan and Chen Aisen.

For Daley this was also a very public moment of fulfilment after bronze medals in London and Rio, a period that has coincided with marriage to the film producer Dustin Lance Black and the birth of their son, Robbie.

In the glow of victory, Daley spoke with startling clarity about the pressures he has faced in the course of a life lived in the public spotlight.

""There are more openly out athletes at these Olympic Games than any Olympic Games previously. I came out in 2013 and when I was younger I always felt like the one that was alone and different and didn’t fit ... I hope that any young LGBT person out there can see that no matter how alone you feel right now, you are not alone.”

There was added significance in delivering this message at a table between Chinese athletes and Russian bronze medallists, with the media of both nations broadcasting his words. Same-sex marriage is not legal in either country.

"Joan Macdonald (@trainwithjoan) has not always looked like a bodybuilder. At 71, she weighed 90kg (14st 4lb), and had rising blood pressure and kidney troubles. She was also on medication for cholesterol and acid reflux, and her doctor wanted to double the dose.

Her daughter, Michelle, expressed Macdonald’s dilemma bluntly. 'You’re going to end up like your mother did in a nursing home!' she told Macdonald. 'And people are going to have to look after you. Do you want that?'

'Of course I didn’t want it,' Macdonald says now. 'I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.' Macdonald’s thoughts swirled for two weeks. She thought: 'I want to earn Michelle’s respect. I mean, she loves me, but you can love a person without even liking them.'

She left her home in Ontario, Canada, to join Michelle and her husband, both fitness coaches, in Tulum, Mexico. Macdonald learned to make protein shakes. She visited the gym. She followed Michelle’s workout program, using the machines, then light weights – 2.5lb – working up to heavier ones. She mimes raising a barbell and lowering it behind her head. She can do this with 25lb.

'Wow! Your back!' people in the gym told her. 'It’s so defined!' They took photos. 'I’m going: wooh! That looks pretty good! I’ve got some muscles here.' Within nine months, she was off all medication.

'There is a misconception that people over 65 cannot produce hypertrophy [growth] of the muscle,' says Mark Peterson, an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the University of Michigan. 'Muscle is a tissue that can adapt with stimulus.' The key is to check with a doctor first, and start slowly.

On Instagram, Macdonald posts photos of herself in sports tops, or jumping waves in beachwear. She has 1.4m followers and a partnership with the retailer Women’s Best. 'I have a tendency to do things that anyone else would say: oh my God! What’s she doing now?'

Macdonald celebrated her 75th birthday this year by zip lining. In DIY projects, her husband is supervisor and Macdonald 'dogsbody'. But now, she says: 'I’m building me instead.'

"Five members of a Hong Kong union behind a series of children’s books about sheep trying to hold back wolves from their village have been arrested for sedition.

The arrests by the new national security police unit, which is spearheading a sweeping crackdown on dissent, are the latest action against pro-democracy activists since huge and often violent protests convulsed the city two years ago.

Police said on Thursday that the two men and three women aged between 25 and 28 had “conspired to publish, distribute, exhibit or copy seditious publications”.

The group was attempting to stir up “the public’s – and especially young children’s – hatred towards Hong Kong’s government and judiciary and to incite violence and illegal acts,” police said in their statement.

In recent months the union published three illustrated ebooks that try to explain Hong Kong’s democracy movement to children.

The first book, titled Guardians of Sheep Village explains the 2019 pro-democracy protests that swept through Hong Kong with supporters portrayed as sheep living in a village surrounded by wolves

Janitors of Sheep Village, the second book, sees cleaners in the village go on strike to force out wolves who leave litter everywhere. The introduction explains it is a reference to Hong Kong medical workers striking last year in a bid to force the government to close the border with mainland China at the start of the pandemic.

The final book in the trilogy – The 12 Braves of Sheep Village – is about a group of sheep who flee their village by boat because of the wolves. It is a direct reference to 12 Hongkongers who made a failed bid to escape by speedboat last year to Taiwan but were detained by the Chinese coastguard and jailed.

Sedition is a colonial-era law that until last year had not been used since Hong Kong’s 1997 handover to China. It carries up to two years in jail for a first offence. Police and prosecutors are now regularly using it alongside the national security law to clamp down on political speech and views.

Most of those arrested for such crimes are denied bail.

"""It is such an honour""

The gold medal-winning rower Mohamed Sbihi will make history tomorrow as the first Muslim to carry the British flag at an Olympic opening ceremony.

He will be joined by another gold medallist, the sailor Hannah Mills, a campaigner for clean oceans and the eradication of single use plastic in sport.

It is the first time that two competitors will be able to carry the flag after the IOC announced last year that each national Olympic committee could nominate one female and one male athlete as flag bearers.

“It is such an honour,” Sbihi, who won a gold medal at the Rio Olympics in the men’s four, said. “It is an iconic moment within the Olympic movement – people remember those images.

He added: “I’ve won a medal, been to the closing ceremony but now to actually turn up at an opening ceremony and be at the head of the team alongside Hannah will be a lifetime memory that I will never forget.”

Mills, who will be defending her women’s 470 title alongside Eilidh McIntyre in Tokyo, said being chosen was ""the greatest honour in my career and I hope more than ever before that this Games can lift our country and deliver some incredible sporting moments to inspire the nation.”

Sbihi and Mills follow in the footsteps of some of Team GB’s most legendary athletes including Sir Andy Murray, rowers Sir Matthew Pinsent and Sir Steve Redgrave, and also Anita Lonsborough, the first woman to carry the flag for Team GB in Tokyo in 1964.

"On the first day of the Olympics there was not a single shot of an athlete taking a knee on the official Tokyo 2020 live blog, Facebook and Twitter pages or Instagram. 

But the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have now performed a U-turn over their stance to stop their social media teams from posting pictures of athletes taking the knee at these Games.

The decision comes after the Guardian revealed they had issued a diktat against showing such images just hours before Team GB’s women’s first football match against Chile on Wednesday. United States and Sweden players, as well as those from New Zealand, all also took a knee in protest against racism.

An insider told @guardian_sport they found the IOC’s stance odd given the organisation celebrates iconic pictures of protest – including Tommie Smith and John Carlos raising their fists to protest against the unfair treatment of black people in the United States at the 1968 Olympics.

However on Thursday morning Tokyo time on Twitter the @Olympics account tweeted a picture of Lucy Bronze taking a knee – along with a message: “Sports started yesterday. Just some of the highlights: Japan starting strong in softball. Teams were kneeling before the competition.”

Athletes at these Games are allowed to protest after the IOC relaxed Rule 50, which had previously forbidden athletes to make any kind of “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas”.

Peaceful protest is now allowed on the field of play, provided it is done without disruption and with respect for fellow competitors. However, sanctions are still threatened for any protests made on the medal podium.

"Did you know public street harassment is not illegal in the UK?

That is likely to change though under plans being drawn up by the government as part of its long-awaited strategy to tackle violence against women and girls (VAWG) for England and Wales.

A new street harassment law has long been called for by campaigners - and while the home secretary Priti Patel was reported to be reluctant to introduce such a law previously - she has now said she is “determined to give the police the powers they need to crack down on perpetrators and carry out their duties to protect the public whilst providing victims with the care and support they deserve”.

More than 180,000 people responded to a consultation on the new violence against women strategy, the majority of them following the murder of Sarah Everard, who was killed while walking home from a friend’s house in Clapham, south London in March.

The use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in cases of sexual harassment and abuse in higher education settings could be also be banned after a review.

The strategy will also see the launch of a new “StreetSafe” app allowing women and girls to record where they feel unsafe, as well as a public health campaign which will focus on perpetrator behaviour.

A £5m “safety of women at night” fund will concentrate on “innovative” projects, such as the widely criticised pilot to put undercover policemen in bars and nightclubs to keep women safe.

"A California couple has been criminally charged for their role in igniting last year’s destructive El Dorado wildfire after they used a pyrotechnic device during a gender-reveal party.

The blaze torched close to 23,000 acres (9,300 hectares), destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings, and claimed the life of a firefighter, Charlie Morton.

Refugio Manuel Jimenez Jr and Angela Renee Jimenez were indicted for 30 crimes including involuntary manslaughter, said Jason Anderson, the San Bernardino county district attorney, during a press conference. The couple pleaded not guilty and were released to await their court date.

“You’re obviously dealing with lost lives, you’re dealing with injured lives, and you’re dealing with people’s residences that were burned and their land that was burned,” Anderson said. “That encompasses a lot of, not only emotion, but damage, both financially and psychologically.”

The charges were based on 34 witness testimonies given to a grand jury, along with 434 exhibits presented.

Along with the destroyed homes and buildings, four additional residences were damaged and there were 13 injuries. Morton, who was 39 years old when he was killed, was a 14-year veteran firefighter with the San Bernardino national forest service, and served as part of an elite team that deploys across the US to fight wildland fires.

“He’s fighting a fire that was started because of a smoke bomb,” Anderson said of Morton’s death. “That’s the only reason he’s there.”

The El Dorado fire erupted on 5 September 2020 in San Bernardino county and burned for the next 23 days. 

The day the couple allegedly used a smoke bomb to reveal the gender of their soon-to-be-born baby, temperatures were scorching, 15 to 20 degrees above normal for the region, officials reported.

"From @guardian_us: The air quality in New York City is currently among the worst in the world as cities across the eastern US were shrouded in smoke from wildfires raging several thousand miles away on the country’s west coast.

State officials in New York advised vulnerable people, such as those with asthma and heart disease, to avoid strenuous outdoor activity as air pollution soared to eclipse Lima in Peru and Kolkata in India to be ranked as the worst in the world on Tuesday.

Smoke from more than 80 major wildfires burning in the US west has caused hazy skies and plunging air quality in eastern American and Canadian cities including Philadelphia, Washington DC, Pittsburgh and Toronto, as well as New York.

On Wednesday morning, the air quality index surged to 157 in Manhattan, well above the threshold of 100 where health is considered to be threatened. Vulnerable people include pregnant women and the elderly, as well as even those outside these groups, can experience breathing difficulty, throat irritation and runny eyes when exposed to air this bad.

“I think it’s unusual to have this kind of haze, I don’t recall seeing this kind of thing,” said George Pope, professor of earth and environmental studies at Montclair State University, who added that he could not see Manhattan from his New Jersey office. “You can pretty much always see the skyline, at least a silhouette, if it’s a hazy day. This is, like, this is unprecedented.”

"The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have banned their social media teams from posting pictures of athletes taking the knee at these Olympic Games, the Guardian can reveal.

An insider said the message was delivered from on high on Tuesday evening Tokyo time, with a specific reference to Team GB’s women’s first football match against Chile, just hours before it kicked off in Sapporo on Wednesday.

The image of both teams taking the knee beforehand, in a protest against racism and online hate, was seen on live TV and the gesture was then followed by United States and Sweden players as well as those from New Zealand. The players of Team Australia chose to stand.

None of these powerful pictures were posted on the official Tokyo 2020 live blog, or its Facebook and Twitter pages, or its Instagram site, which has more than half a million followers. They were also not seen on any of the IOC’s social channels.

Speaking after the match against Chile, Steph Houghton, one of Team GB’s three captains, said the decision to take a knee was supported by the entire squad. “As players in Great Britain we’ve been taking the knee in club and international matches and we felt strongly as a group that we wanted to show support for those affected by discrimination and equality,” she added.

“It was a proud moment because the Chile players took the knee too to show how united we are as sport.”

"Anthony Fauci has a reputation for plain speaking, as a senator who accused him of lying discovered to his cost last night.

A congressional hearing on the coronavirus pandemic was electrified when Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, clashed with Rand Paul, a Republican senator for Kentucky and longtime opponent of mask-wearing.

Paul suggested that Fauci had lied before Congress in May when he denied that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded so-called “gain of function” research – the practice of enhancing a virus in a lab to study its potential impact in the real world – at a virology lab in Wuhan, China.

Giannis Antetokounmpo ended one of the greatest NBA finals ever with 50 points and a championship Milwaukee waited 50 years to win again.

Antetokounmpo added 14 rebounds and five blocked shots as the Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns 105-98 to win the series 4-2. It was the third game in this series with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds for Antetokounmpo, a dominant debut finals performance that takes its place among some of the game’s greatest.

He shot 16 for 25 from the field and made an unbelievable 17-of-19 free throws – a spectacular showing for any shooter, let alone one who was hitting just 55.6% in the post-season and was ridiculed for it at times.

""People told me I can’t make free throws and I made them tonight. And I’m a freaking champion,"" Antetokounmpo said.

Antetokounmpo was the star of these finals in every way, from his powerful play on the court to his humble thoughts in interviews to taking time after Tuesday night’s win to find children to high-five amid the celebrations. And he did it all after missing the final two games of the Eastern Conference finals with a hyperextended left knee, an injury that at first he feared could be serious to end his season.

"Wally Funk, 82, has achieved her lifelong dream to go to space, after sixty years of being denied the chance.

In the 1960s, Funk took part in the Women in Space Program, where she excelled in its rigorous training for female astronauts. But after it was abruptly shut down in 1962 she was forced to forge a new path as a trailblazing pilot.

Another chance came along fourteen years later, when NASA opened its astronaut applications up to women in 1976. Funk applied three times but was turned down each time.

But today she joined Jeff Bezos on his Blue Origin flight, and made history as the oldest person to go to space. After landing she said, “I want to go again, fast”.

Describing the experience, Funk said: “When I went up this morning the noise wasn’t quite as bad [as expected] and we went right on up and I saw darkness. I thought I was going to see the world but we weren’t quite high enough.

“I felt great, I felt like I was just laying down and I was going into space.”

After the disappointment of the 1960s, Funk went on to become a flight instructor. She said she had taught more than 3,000 people to fly. “I’ve always done everything on my own,” she said. “I didn’t do dolls, I did outside stuff and I flew airplanes, 19,000-something hours. I loved it.”

"Why is Jeff Bezos flying to space? Because billionaires think Earth is a sinking ship, writes @guardian_us contributor Hamilton Nolan.

The Amazon founder hailed today as “the best day ever” after completing his pioneering foray into space with three crewmates, among them his brother Mark.

The billionaire’s New Shepard rocket and capsule touched down in the Texas desert after a suborbital flight that lasted a mere 11 minutes, but set several records for his Blue Origin space company, including the oldest and youngest humans to fly into space. 

Wally Funk, an 82-year-old female aviation pioneer who trained as an astronaut in the 1960s, flew as Bezos’s guest, while Oliver Daemen, 18, a student from the Netherlands and son of a private enquiry firm’s chief executive, was Blue Origin’s first paying customer.

The world’s richest man with an estimated net worth of $206bn, Bezos, 57, sprayed champagne and shouted his enjoyment after the successful landing of New Shepard’s first crewed mission following 15 uncrewed test flights.

The naturalist, TV presenter and author @chrisgpackham2 has revealed that when he dies he would like to be cremated and have his ashes mixed with those of his dogs before being scattered in a woodland.

In a recent interview, he told the Radio Times that his love for his late poodles Itchy and Scratchy is in part due to them helping him through periods of depression - likening himself and his pets to “three organisms umbilically linked” with a shared personality.

Packham says he got two miniature poodles, Sid and Nancy, weeks after the deaths of Itchy and Scratchy. “I bond to them more tightly than I do people. Though Sid and Nancy have found a new place in my heart, the hole left by Itchy and Scratchy is still there. It’s quite hard to talk about,” he said.

"‘Would a male competitor be similarly criticised?’

Double Paralympic world champion Olivia Breen asked this question after being told that her competition briefs were “too short and inappropriate” by a female official while competing at the English Championships in Bedford this weekend.

The 24-year-old, who is set to compete at the Paralympics in Tokyo next month, said she was wearing official Adidas briefs for 2021 – and questioned whether a male athlete would ever have been subjected to such comments.

“I am alway grateful for the incredible volunteers who officiate at athletics events,” said Breen, who has cerebral palsy. “They do an amazing job and make it possible for us to compete. However, tonight I feel disappointed because just as I finished my long jump competition one of the female officials felt it necessary to inform me that my sprint briefs were too short and inappropriate. I was left speechless.

“I have been wearing the same sprint style briefs for many years and they are specifically designed for competing in,” she added. “I will hopefully be wearing them in Tokyo. It made me question whether a male competitor would be similarly criticised.”

An England Athletics spokesperson said: “We are aware of the post and will be investigating as a matter of urgency. The wellbeing of all participants in athletics is of the utmost importance and everyone should feel comfortable to compete and participate in the sport.”

"This photo is of Joannah Stutchbury in 2018, resisting bulldozers threatening Kenya’s Kiambu forest.

Last week, the prominent environment activist was killed - shot dead near her home in Nairobi - after receiving multiple death threats following her campaign against the development of wetlands in a national park.

Friends said the 67-year-old had stopped her car to clear branches blocking her driveway when she was shot several times.

Neighbours found her body in the car with the engine still running and valuables still in the vehicle, suggesting the attack was not a robbery.

Stutchbury had vocally opposed attempts by powerful local business owners to build on the nearby Kiambu forest, and had received death threats in the past.

“It is really awful. The conservation fraternity is very shaken. It is devastating,” said Dr Paula Kahumbu, the CEO of WildlifeDirect, a conservation NGO.

The Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, condemned the killing. “For the longest time, Joannah has been a steadfast champion for the conservation of our environment and is remembered for her relentless efforts to protect Kiambu forest from encroachment,” he said.

Though Kenya’s natural heritage is a main source of tourist revenue, it is threatened by encroachment, squatters and developers, often with links to powerful local politicians.

Stutchbury’s killing is only one of a number of violent deaths of conservationists in recent years. In 2018, Esmond Bradley Martin, a Kenya-based American conservationist whose investigations of the elephant ivory and rhino horn trades were considered critical in efforts to protect the threatened species, was stabbed to death in his Nairobi home. His murder remains unresolved.

"Calling all customers: there's a giant food monopoly in aisle one. And two, three, four, five and six ...

We've designed this game using the findings of a joint investigation we've done with Food and Water Watch. We found that consumer choice in the US is largely an illusion – despite supermarket shelves and fridges brimming with different brands.

In fact, a few powerful transnational companies dominate every link of the food supply chain: from seeds and fertilizers to slaughterhouses and supermarkets to cereals and beers.

The size, power and profits of these mega companies have expanded thanks to political lobbying and weak regulation which enabled a wave of unchecked mergers and acquisitions.

This matters because the size and influence of these mega-companies enables them to largely dictate what America’s two million farmers grow and how much they are paid, as well as what consumers eat and how much our groceries cost.

Overall, a handful of powerful companies control the majority market share of almost 80% of dozens of grocery items bought regularly by ordinary Americans, our analysis reveals.

But we don't want to spoil the game too much.

"Sir Ian McKellen played Shakespeare’s tragic prince in 1971. Now, half a century later aged 82, he’s starring as Hamlet once again in an age-blind production at the Theatre Royal Windsor.

In an interview with the Guardian published last month, @ianmckellen told us during rehearsals cast mates of all ages have said they keep forgetting whether he’s 80-odd or 30-odd. “I’ve been having the time of my life.”

By the sound of it, the new production - one of the year’s hottest stage tickets - will have fun with the crisscrossing age dynamics, as a young-ish character inhabits an older man’s body; as an experienced pro brings all his technical nous to bear on a role that’s traditionally played by an actor nearer the start of a career than the end.

“When I was young I was always playing old parts,” McKellen says. “And, of course, I was having to imagine it. Because what does ‘old’ mean? I had no idea! Now that I’m old I do know. And I also know what it’s like to be young. Because as you get older, inside, you’re ageless. Inside? Quite honestly? I feel about 12.”

"The largest ever international study of people with long Covid has identified more than 200 symptoms and prompted researchers to call for a national screening programme.

The study, published in a Lancet medical journal, surveyed 3,762 people with confirmed or suspected long Covid from 56 countries. It identified 203 symptoms, which spanned 10 of the body’s organ systems. The research found a third of the symptoms continued to affect patients for at least six months.

Athena Akrami, a neuroscientist at University College London, and senior author of the study, said: “A lot of post-Covid clinics in the UK have focused on respiratory rehabilitation. It’s true that a lot of people have shortness of breath, but they also have a lot of other problems and types of symptoms that the clinics need to provide a more holistic approach to.”

She said that she was still experiencing symptoms 16 months after becoming infected with coronavirus, adding: “There are likely to be tens of thousands of long Covid patients suffering in silence, unsure that their symptoms are connected to Covid-19.

"“Climate chance isn’t abstract anymore. We are experiencing it up close and painfully.”

These photos show Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate before and after catastrophic flooding. Around 1,300 people are unaccounted for in the district, the regional administration said on Friday.

“I fear that we will only see the full extent of the disaster in the coming days,"" German chancellor Angela Merkel, said from Washington late on Thursday, calling it a day “characterised by fear, by despair, by suffering”.

The death toll from the floods in Germany and Belgium have risen to more than 100.

In Germany, parts of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia were inundated with 148 litres of rain per sq metre within 48 hours in an area of the country that usually sees about 80 litres in the whole of July.

Authorities said 93 people had died in the two states, including at least nine residents of an assisted living facility for people with disabilities in Rhineland-Palatinate.

Belgian authorities said on Friday morning the country’s death toll had risen to 12. Switzerland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have also been severely affected by flooding, but have so far reported no loss of life.

The intensity and scale of the devastation this week have shocked climate scientists, who did not expect records to be broken this much, over such a wide area or this soon.

After the deadly heatwave in the US and Canada, where temperatures rose above 49.6C two weeks ago, the deluge in central Europe has raised fears that human-caused climate disruption is making extreme weather even worse than predicted.

Malu Dreyer, the governor of Rhineland-Palatinate, said the disaster showed the need to speed up efforts to curb global warming. “We’ve experienced droughts, heavy rain and flooding events several years in a row, including in our state,” she said. “Climate chance isn’t abstract anymore. We are experiencing it up close and painfully.”

"To mark the bicentenary of Napoleon Bonaparte’s death, Sotheby’s in Paris has announced one of his distinctive black felt hats - perhaps worn during his army’s crushing defeat of Russia in 1807 - will appear at auction.

The bicorne hat on sale is believed to have been worn by Napoleon when he held the title of Emperor of the French and as he signed the peace treaties of Tilsit that carved up continental Europe into different zones of French and Russian influence.

The hat was previously bought in 1814 by the politician and aristocrat Sir Michael Shaw-Stewart, who had become somewhat obsessed by Napoleon. He bought it to his family estate in Scotland and then it was passed down from generation to generation.

Only 19 bicornes have been identified as belonging to Napoleon, many of them in museum collections. Its sale in September comes with an estimate of €400,000 to €600,000 (£341,000 to £512,000).

Napoleon died aged 51 in exile on the British island of Saint Helena in May 1821 - and still continues to split opinion. He is celebrated by some as a brilliant military strategist and damned by others as a ruthless warmongering dictator.

"Exclusive: Vladimir Putin personally authorised a secret spy agency operation to support a “mentally unstable” Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election during a closed session of Russia’s national security council, according to what are assessed to be leaked Kremlin documents.

According to the papers obtained by the Guardian, the key meeting took place on 22 January 2016 with the Russian president, his spy chiefs and senior ministers all present.

They agreed a Trump White House would help secure Moscow’s strategic objectives, among them “social turmoil” in the US and a weakening of the American president’s negotiating position.

By this point Trump was the frontrunner in the Republican party’s nomination race. A report prepared by Putin’s expert department recommended Moscow use “all possible force” to ensure a Trump victory.

"England footballer Bukayo Saka has admitted that he “knew instantly” that he would receive racially abusive messages after the Euro 2020 final but vowed that the experience and the negativity will not “break me”.

The 19-year-old's failed penalty in a shootout meant Italy won the tournament after Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho also missed theirs. All three were instantly subjected to racist abuse on social media.

In a statement @bukayosaka87, urged Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to act and introduce measures to prevent anyone else experiencing the same.

“My reaction post-match said it all - I was hurting so much and I felt like I’d let you all and my England family down. For those who have campaigned on my behalf and sent me heartfelt letters, wished me and my family well, I am so thankful.

“To the social media platforms @instagram @twitter @facebook: I don’t want any child or adult to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me, Marcus and have received. I knew instantly the kind of hate I was about to receive and that is a sad reality that your powerful platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages.""

“There is no place for racism or hate of any kind on football or any area of society and to the majority of people coming together to call out the people sending these messages, by taking action and reporting these to the police and driving out the hate by being kind to one and other, we will win. 

""Love always wins. Bukayo Saka""

"For the first time ever, scientists have confirmed the Amazon rainforest is now emitting more carbon dioxide than it is able to absorb.

The giant forest had previously been a carbon sink, absorbing the emissions driving the climate crisis, but is now causing its acceleration, researchers said.

The emissions amount to a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, according to a study. Most are caused by fires, many deliberately set to clear land for beef and soy production. But even without fires, hotter temperatures and droughts mean the south-eastern Amazon has become a source of CO2, rather than a sink.

Growing trees and plants have taken up about a quarter of all fossil fuel emissions since 1960, with the Amazon playing a major role as the largest tropical forest. Losing the Amazon’s power to capture CO2 is a stark warning that slashing emissions from fossil fuels is more urgent than ever, scientists said.

The government of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been harshly criticised for encouraging more deforestation, which has surged to a 12-year high, while fires hit their highest level in June since 2007.

"Heavy floods have ravaged western Germany – leaving at least 38 people dead, including two firemen, who drowned attempting to help stranded residents.

The floods were caused by a slow-moving low-pressure weather system, which in 48 hours brought down 148 litres of rain per square metre to a part of Germany that usually sees only half of that in the whole month.

The army has been deployed across North-Rhine Westphalia to help residents, and rail, road and river transport has been disrupted in the country’s most populous state. The state premier, Malu Dreyer, said on Thursday: “We have never seen a catastrophe like this ... It is truly devastating.”

"This is the deeply moving moment a Chinese father was reunited with his son 24 years after he was abducted by human traffickers in front of their home in Shandong at the age of two in 1997.

Guo Gangtang spent more than two decades crisscrossing the country, travelling more than 300,000 miles on a motorbike, with two banners each showing a photo of his son, Guo Xinzhen.

After nearly a quarter-century odyssey, their reunion on Tuesday was held at a police station and reported across the country. On social media, related hashtags have been read hundreds of millions of times, with many people sending well wishes to them.

Shortly after Guo’s son was abducted, he began to travel across more than 20 Chinese provinces to look for clues. He suffered broken bones in traffic accidents, and damaged 10 other motorcycles.

“Only by hitting the road looking for my son, did I feel I am a father,” he once told Chinese media.

In 2015, their story also inspired a movie, Lost and Love, starring Hong Kong mega-celebrity Andy Lau. Lau said this week that he felt “extremely happy and inspired” to learn of the news, while pleading with the public to support the government’s anti-human trafficking campaign.

Child abduction has been a problem in China for decades, with thousands of children being snatched by traffickers every year. Though authorities say that with the help of new technologies and bioscience, more and more families are being reunited in recent years.

"A group of cancer researchers are calling for the link between alcohol and cancer to be highlighted, after estimating it caused more than 740,000 cancer cases around the world last year.

The study, published in The Lancet Oncology - a world leading clinical journal - claims there is strong evidence that alcohol consumption can cause various cancers including those of the breast, liver, colon, rectum, oropharynx, larynx and oesophagus. It also suggests that even low levels of drinking can increase the risk.

Harriet Rumgay, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in France, and a co-author of the study, said alcohol caused a substantial burden of cancer globally, and this was shown even at lower levels of drinking.

The results suggested alcohol consumption was behind an estimated 568,700 cancer cases in men and 172,600 cases in women in 2020

According to a separate study produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer published in February, there were an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases in 2020 and almost 10 million cancer deaths.

Rumgay said: “It would be very interesting to estimate cancer deaths due to alcohol, which is a follow-up step from the analysis that we have done here.” But researchers have first suggested that alcohol labels should have cancer warnings, that there could be higher taxes on alcohol and that marketing of drinks could be reduced.

"As wildfires burn throughout the US west on the heels of record heatwaves, experts are warning that the region is caught in a vicious feedback cycle of extreme heat, drought and fire, all amplified by the climate crisis.

More than 60 wildfires were burning across at least 10 states in the parched American west on Tuesday, with the largest, in Oregon, consuming an area nearly twice the size of Portland.

The fires erupted as the west was in the grip of the second bout of dangerously high temperatures in just a few weeks.

The fires have torched homes and forced thousands to evacuate from Alaska to Wyoming, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Arizona, Idaho and Montana accounted for more than half of the large active fires.

The July heatwave follows an unusual June siege of broiling temperatures in the west and comes amid worsening drought conditions throughout the region.

"We're going to need a bigger bowl ...

Authorities in Minnesota have appealed to aquarium owners to stop releasing pet fish into waterways, after several huge goldfish were pulled from a local lake.

Officials in Burnsville, about 15 miles south of Minneapolis, said released goldfish can grow to several times their normal size and wreak havoc on indigenous species.

“Please don’t release your pet goldfish into ponds and lakes!” the city tweeted. “They grow bigger than you think and contribute to poor water quality by mucking up the bottom sediments and uprooting plants.”

Last November, officials in nearby Carver county removed as many as 50,000 goldfish from local waters. The county water management manager, Paul Moline, said goldfish “are an understudied species” with “a high potential to negatively impact the water quality of lakes”.

Like carp, goldfish can easily reproduce and survive through low levels of oxygen during the Minnesota winter.

“A few goldfish might seem to some like a harmless addition to the local water body – but they’re not,” the state's department of natural resources advised.

"“I’m here because of hunger, because there’s no medicine, because of power cuts – because there’s a lack of everything,” .

These were the words of a man in his 40s - who didn’t want to give his name for fear of reprisals - as he joined the biggest mass demonstrations for three decades have rippled through Cuba.

Thousands took to the streets this weekend in cities throughout the island, in rare mass demonstrations against food shortages, high prices and communist rule.

The protesters were met by uniformed and plainclothes police officers, who bundled hundreds of demonstrators into police cars. Youths tore up paving slabs and hurled them at police; officers used pepper spray and beat protesters with truncheons.

Cubans are living through the gravest economic crisis the country has known for 30 years. The Trump administration hammered the island with more than 200 new sanctions aimed at sabotaging the island’s’ economy and stirring discontent, measures that have so far been left untouched by the Biden administration.

Since the pandemic, which has gutted tourism revenue, Cubans have become accustomed to waiting in line for hours to buy basic goods and there's a lack of medicine in the pharmacies.

With millions of Cubans now with mobile internet on their phones, news of the protests quickly swept across the country. By early afternoon, thousands marched through central Havana, chanting “homeland and life” and “freedom”.

At 3pm local time on Sunday all television channels were interrupted with a broadcast from President Miguel Díaz-Canel who said that “destabilisation in our country”. He added: ""We call upon all the revolutionaries of the country, all the communists, to take to the streets.”

The protests were the biggest since 1994, when tens of thousands demonstrated at Havana’s Malecón promenade amid an acute economic crisis brought on by the fall of the Soviet Union.

"Italy are champions of Europe again, for the first time since 1968, breaking English hearts in the process.

The 120 minutes had been nerve-shredding, England enjoying early elation when Luke Shaw scored his first ever international goal, a magnificent half-volley with the game’s first move. And then came what felt like the slow and inexorable trudge towards defeat.

Gareth Southgate’s team had been comfortable in the first half but the final slid away from them thereafter, Italy turning up the temperature, pinning England back.

Italy got the equaliser that they deserved through Leonardo Bonucci and, during extra time, the spectre of penalties hung heavy. When they came, England lost their nerve – missing three of their kicks.

It was a night when sporting immortality had beckoned for England, a first trophy since the World Cup of 1966. In the end, it would be a depressingly familiar hard luck story.

For Italy, it was a second European Championship and glory for Roberto Mancini, whose work since taking over as the manager from Gian Piero Ventura after the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup has been little short of sensational.

Italy had the know-how; they have almost forgotten what defeat is. They are unbeaten in 34 matches, a run that spans nearly three years.

"Which face do you feel the strongest emotional response to?

Whether in a cloud, the front of a car, or even a toasted sandwich, seeing faces in inanimate objects is a common experience.

According to new research by the University of Sydney, our brains detect and respond emotionally to these illusory faces the same way they do to real human faces.

Once considered a symptom of psychosis, seeing faces in everyday objects arises from an error in visual perception.

Lead researcher Prof David Alais said human brains are evolutionarily hardwired to recognise faces, with highly specialised brain regions for facial detection and processing.

“We are such a sophisticated social species and face recognition is very important,” Alais said. “You need to recognise who it is, is it family, is it a friend or foe, what are their intentions and emotions?

“Faces are detected incredibly fast. The brain seems to do this… using a kind of template-matching procedure, so if it sees an object that appears to have two eyes above a nose above a mouth, then it goes, ‘Oh I’m seeing a face.’

“It’s a bit fast and loose and sometimes it makes mistakes, so something that resembles a face will often trigger this template match.”

In the research, when people were shown a jumble of real human faces and faces in inanimate objects, the latter were processed in the same way we would normally process emotion in a real face.

"Giant pandas are no longer endangered in the wild, but they are still vulnerable with a population outside captivity of 1,800, Chinese officials have said after years of conservation efforts.

The head of the environment ministry’s department of nature and ecology conservation, Cui Shuhong, said the reclassification was the result of “improved living conditions and China’s efforts in keeping their habitats integrated”.

He said the announcement reflected China’s national efforts to preserve biodiversity in recent years. The authorities have worked to expand giant pandas’ habitats and replanted bamboo forests to feed them.

The number of Siberian tigers, amur leopards, Asian elephants and crested ibis have also “visibly increased” as a result of continuing conservation efforts in recent years, Cui told a press conference this week.

The decision by China’s own conservation authority comes five years after the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) removed giant pandas from its endangered species list and classified them as vulnerable.

This week’s announcement was met with delight on social media. Related hashtags on Weibo have been read nearly 10m times.

"Mussels on Canada's coast were effectively cooked by the abnormally warm water following last week's record heatwave.

More than 1 billion marine animals along Canada’s Pacific coast are likely to have died, experts warn, highlighting the vulnerability of ecosystems that aren't used to such extreme temperatures.

The “heat dome” that settled over western Canada and the north-western US for five days pushed temperatures in communities along the coast to 40C (104F) – shattering longstanding records and offering little respite for days.

The intense and unrelenting heat is believed to have killed as many as 500 people in the province of British Columbia and contributed to the hundreds of wildfires currently burning across the area.

Christopher Harley, a marine biologist at the University of British Columbia who calculated the 1 billion figure, said: “The shore doesn’t usually crunch when you walk on it. But there were so many empty mussel shells lying everywhere that you just couldn’t avoid stepping on dead animals while walking around.""

Harley was struck by the smell of rotting mussels. Snails, sea stars and clams were decaying in the shallow water. “It was an overpowering, visceral experience,” he said.

The mass death of shellfish would temporarily affect water quality because mussels and clams help filter the sea, Harley said, keeping it clear enough that sunlight reaches the eelgrass beds while also creating habitats for other species.

Experts have cautioned that the province needs to adapt to the reality that sudden and sustained heatwaves are likely to become more common as a result of climate change.

"What do you think of the world's tallest sandcastle?

It has been completed in Denmark, towering more than 20 metres high and is made of nearly 5,000 tonnes of sand.

Standing 21.16 metres in height (69.4 feet), the castle is more than 3 metres taller than one built in Germany in 2019, which previously held the title, according to Guinness World Records.

It took 4,860 tonnes of sand make up the intricately decorated structure, which is reminiscent of a pyramid, in the small seaside town of Blokhus.

That's half the weight of the Eiffel Tower!

Its Dutch creator, Wilfred Stijger, was assisted by 30 of the world’s best sand sculptors. He said he wanted the castle to represent the power the coronavirus has had over the world since the beginning of the pandemic. On top of the sandcastle is a model of the virus wearing a crown.

“It’s ruling our lives everywhere,” Stijger said. “It tells you what to do ... It tells you to stay away from your family and not go to nice places. Don’t do activities, stay home.”

To make it stick together well, the sand contains approximately 10% clay and a layer of glue was applied after it was completed so that it could stand up to autumn and winter weather.

The castle is expected to stand until heavy frost sets in early next year.

"It is almost a year to the day that Venezuelan couple Haydée and Juan Carlos Rodríguez first spotted an injured sloth lying by the side of the road. Trying to cross from one tree to another, the animal had climbed on to a high-voltage power line and been electrocuted.

The animal had lost the claws on three of its paws because of burns and the Rodríguezes were told by a local wildlife expert that it was not likely to survive, and that they should leave it to die.

Today, the sloth is not only thriving but has proved the inspiration for the couple to create what they believe to be Venezuela’s first dedicated sloth rescue and rehabilitation centre.

“We [humans] have invaded their space. When they can’t move from tree to tree, they get confused and climb on to power lines. That’s how they meet their death,” Haydée says.

In the last five months, Juan Carlos and Haydée have rescued 41 sloths, and returned 36 of them to the lush greenery where they are often found.

Their work is vital considering the state of wildlife rehabilitation and conservation in the country, which has been underfunded for years.

"Amber Heard's baby announcement has attracted huge attention - not only because of her celebrity - but because she is part of what seems to be a growing trend of women becoming single mothers by choice.

Heard is in a relationship with the cinematographer Bianca Butti, but is reportedly the sole legal parent of her daughter, Oonagh Paige Heard, who was born in April. The actor says she decided to get pregnant before meeting her partner.

“Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child,” Heard wrote in an Instagram post last Thursday. “I wanted to do it on my own terms. I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way.

"Just in: England are only one step away from bringing it home.

They've reached their first final at a major men’s tournament since 1966 after a 2-1 extra-time win over Denmark. Harry Kane’s goal, scored on the rebound after Kasper Schmeichel had saved his penalty, earned victory on a nerve-shredding night at Wembley.

Mikkel Damsgaard had fired Denmark ahead with half an hour played, beating Jordan Pickford with a superb strike from a 25-yard free-kick. England rallied and five minutes before the break, Bukayo Saka’s low cross towards Sterling was turned in by Danish defender Simon Kjær.

England cranked up the pressure in extra-time with Kane and Jack Grealish going close, before Raheem Sterling went down in the penalty area under pressure from Joakim Mæhle and Mathias Jensen.

The referee Danny Makkelie pointed to the spot and, while replays showed minimal contact, VAR did not overturn the decision. Kane stepped up and Schmeichel went the right way, but the forward pounced on the rebound to send Wembley into raptures, scenes that only intensified upon the final whistle.

"Spike Lee commented on the US’s current racial justice crisis in typically forthright fashion at the Cannes film festival.

Lee, who is the president of the jury that will pick the winner of the Cannes Palme d’Or, was asked a question about his 1989 film Do the Right Thing, which contains a scene in which a black youth, Radio Raheem, is killed by police.

Here's what Lee, who was wearing a cap with “1619” in reference to the date of the arrival of the first enslaved Africans in Virginia, had to say.

"The president of Haiti, Jovenel Moïse, has been shot dead in his home by a group of armed men who also seriously injured his wife, according to a statement made by the country’s interim prime minister.

Claude Joseph condemned the assassination as a “hateful, inhumane and barbaric act"". He told a local radio station that the attack was carried out by an “armed commando group” that included foreigners.

The assassination is likely to plunge the Caribbean nation into further turmoil after several years marked by political unrest and violence, as well as a growing humanitarian crisis and shortages of food.

Moise had faced fierce protests since he took office as president in 2017. The opposition accused him this year of seeking to install a dictatorship by overstaying his mandate and becoming more authoritarian - charges he denied.

He had been ruling by decree for more than a year after the country failed to hold legislative elections and wanted to push through controversial constitutional changes.

There have been intermittent periods of protests and street violence and a rise in gang violence in the country, some of it tied to political parties.

So where does this leave Haiti now?

"Canada will have its first ever Indigenous governor general after prime minister Justin Trudeau appointed Inuk leader Mary Simon to the post.

The former ambassador, journalist and longtime advocate of Inuit rights will represent Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.

While the role is largely ceremonial, performing functions such as swearing in governments and formally signing legislation, the governor general is also the commander-in-chief of the military and can summon, prorogue or dissolve parliament.

Describing the move as a “historic” step, Trudeau announced Simon’s appointment on Tuesday almost six months after his previous selection resigned following allegations of bullying.

“I am honoured, humbled and ready to be Canada’s first Indigenous Governor General,” Simon said, also giving remarks in Inuktitut, her first language. “I can confidently say that my appointment is a historic and inspirational moment for Canada and an important step forward on the long path towards reconciliation.”

Her appointment comes as the country reckons with the discovery of more than 1,000 unmarked graves at the site of former church-run schools for Indigenous children.

In her remarks on Tuesday, Simon spoke of the need for Canada to “fully recognize, memorialize and come to terms with the atrocities of our collective past” as more is learned about the legacy of residential schools.

"It's 160-square-foot (15 sq metre) - and just a few footsteps separate the bed and bathroom - in this unusual rental in Canada.

The Vancouver apartment, described as “ideal for a single individual looking to live downtown at an affordable rate, and who does not need much space” was listed on Craigslist this month.

The rental was removed after a few days, but not before being picked up by the website Vancouver is Awesome, which points out the apartment’s size is smaller than the city’s 250-square-foot (23 sq metre) definition of a micro dwelling.

Its layout means the toilet is in direct line of sight of the bed, without a door - though the shower is hidden behind the vanity unit. It also doesn't include a kitchen.

Vancouver is the seventh most expensive housing market in the world, according to a 2020 survey by commercial real estate firm CBRE, ahead of Los Angeles, Paris and New York.

The micro apartment’s rent of C$680 (US$550 or £396) a month is still more than half the city’s average.

"“Your homophobia is killing us”.

Thousands of people have taken to the streets of towns and cities across Spain to demand justice, equality and protection after a gay man was beaten to death in what police believe could have been a homophobic attack.

Samuel Luiz, a 24-year-old nursing assistant, was out with friends in the Galician city of A Coruña in the early hours of Saturday when an argument started outside a nightclub.

His friends told El Mundo newspaper that Luiz had stepped out of the club to make a video call when two passersby accused him of trying to film them on his phone. Luiz explained he was talking to a friend by video, but he was allegedly attacked by one of the passersby and left with a badly bruised face.

Five minutes later, the assailant allegedly returned with 12 others who beat Luiz unconscious. He was taken to hospital where he died later on Saturday morning.

The attack, which is still being investigated, prompted revulsion across Spain and led to demonstrations last night in cities including A Coruña, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Salamanca, Bilbao and Zaragoza. Demonstrators carried signs with slogans including ""Justice for Samuel"" and “Your homophobia is killing us”.

Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has denounced the killing and offered his condolences to Luiz’s friends and family.

The attack came less than a week after Spain’s annual Pride celebrations and days after Sánchez’s Socialist-led coalition government approved a draft law to protect and strengthen the rights of LGBTI people.

"An upmarket Russian supermarket chain has been accused of ""cowardice"" by Moscow liberals and other Russian LGBTQ allies after removing an advert featuring a lesbian couple who shopped at its store.

VkusVill issued a public apology after being on the end of a conservative backlash for offering a modest portrayal of queer life in Russia.

The ad was seen as a challenge to Russia’s “gay propaganda” law that bans the “promotion of nontraditional sexual relations to minors”.

It featured a lesbian couple, Yuma and Zhenya, and their children, Mila and Alina, who said they enjoyed the supermarket’s onigiri rice balls with mushrooms and that their favourite product was the hummus.

The original post, which bore an 18+ warning to comply with local legislation, read; “We believe not featuring the families of our real customers would be hypocritical”.

But days later the ad was gone. In its place, the chain ran an apology that prominently featured photographs of heterosexual couples and appeared to place the blame for the ad on a small group of its staff.

A VkusVill representative declined to answer questions from the Guardian about whether the supermarket chain had been pressed to pull the ad.

"It was a beautifully simple idea: one family, photographed at the same time every year. 

In the summer of 1991, photographer @zed_nelson, then 25, invited a couple of new parents he'd met at a party to visit his London studio. Oh, and bring your newborn baby, he said.

He would chart the evolution of a parenting life, with Sue fixed in position on the right of the picture, Frank on the left, Eddie inching up between his mum and dad. “Same backdrop, same lights, same camera, same angle,” Nelson explains, adding: “Every year I measure out the distances to the inch. It drives us all a bit mad. But we do keep coming back.”

When Sue looks back at the very earliest photograph in the selection, she remembers the intense sensation of parental duty. “When you first have a child, you think it’s going to go on for ever, just because of that intensity. Actually, the three decades since then have gone in a flash. Like a movie on fast forward. These photos make me realise the sheer speed of time passing.”

“When we started, it was a pre-digital era, pre-internet,” says Frank, “and we didn’t give any thought to what would happen in the future. There’s no way, all those years ago, we would have asked ourselves: ‘What will this all look like in 2021?’”

"Migration is not the biggest challenge facing the world.

It's global inequality.

That's according to research from the development agency @MIDEQHub and their partners in 11 countries in the Global South: Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, Côte d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, Malaysia, Nepal and South Africa.

They've produced a new animation - illustrated by @karriefransman and in partnership with @posnegorg - challenging many of the ideas that currently dominate media representations of migration.

Professor Heaven Crawley, Chair in International Migration and Director of MIDEQ said: “For too long the story of migration has been dominated by the views and interests of the Global North. This story has focused on issues of security and border controls, ignoring the complex factors that drive people to move in different parts of the world.

""Migration is a part of our history and will inevitably be part of our future. If we want migration to work for everyone then we need to better understand and address the structural inequalities – poverty, gender inequalities, racism – that drive migration and limit its potential to contribute to development.”

"Boris Johnson admitted privately that him becoming UK prime minister would be a “ludicrous” idea three years before he took the top job, his former aide Dominic Cummings has claimed.

In another scathing blogpost detailing the political machinations that led up to and followed Brexit, the ex-No 10 adviser alleged that Johnson had admitted immediately after the referendum in 2016 that he was “unfit” to lead the country.

Cummings said Johnson had pulled him to one side in Vote Leave headquarters the morning that David Cameron resigned and the pair had discussed what should happen next. “Obviously it’s ludicrous me being PM – but no more ludicrous than Dave or George [Osborne], don’t you think?” Johnson is said to have told Cummings.

On his subscriber-only blog, Cummings, also argued that the best way of understanding Boris Johnson is realising that he operates in two modes: Boris-Normal (his routine, chaotic mode) and Boris-Self-Aware (his ruthless, effective mode).

""Boris is complex portrayed as simple. Behind each mask lies another mask — but there’s no masterplan behind all the masks, just the age old ‘will to power’,"" Cummings wrote.

Cummings, who often avoided scrutiny during his time in government, has set about trying to trash Johnson’s reputation since leaving Downing Street last winter. Last month, he wrote a 7,000-word essay attacking Johnson’s ""chronic dysfunction"" and published texts from the PM calling his then-health minister, Matt Hancock, “totally fucking hopeless”.

At the time, Downing Street refused to comment on Cummings’ claims, while also declining to deny the veracity of the screenshots, or to reject the specific claims. “I don’t plan to get into the detail of what’s been published,” Johnson’s spokesperson said. Asked if the images of the PM’s messages were genuine, he said: “Our focus is on not examining those specific images, but delivering on the public’s priorities.”

"From @guardian_sport: A Danish supporter has spoken about the moment he had a rainbow flag confiscated before the Euro 2020 quarter-final against the Czech Republic in Baku.

Denmark won the game 2-1 and will now take on England at Wembley for a place in the final but for Kristoffer Føns the incident left a sour taste on an otherwise enjoyable evening.

‘An official guard came up to be and pulled the flag out of my hands,’ he told Danish public broadcaster DR. He had been watching from home earlier in the tournament and seen the news that the Allianz Arena in Munich could not be lit up in rainbow colours for the visit of Hungary in the group stage.

Uefa said in a statement on that occasion that it had no choice than to reject the action on the grounds that it ‘contravened its regulations as a political and neutral organisation’. It said due to the ‘political context’ of the application, ‘a message aiming at a decision taken by the Hungarian national parliament’, Uefa had to decline the request.

Føns added: ‘I thought before going to Baku that we are going to a place where human rights are not really a thing. I have been very sceptical about the fact that the World Cup is being held in Qatar so I thought that I would be a hypocrite if I didn’t do anything.’

"Yes, this is real. It may look like CGI, but a whirling vortex of fire really erupted on the surface of the ocean near Mexico's Yucatan peninsulia on Friday. 

The country's state oil company Pemex blamed a gas leak from an underwater pipeline for sparking the blaze.

The fire took more than five hours to fully put out, according to the company. It began in an underwater pipeline that connects to a platform at Pemex’s flagship Ku Maloob Zaap oil development.

The blaze was dubbed an “eye of fire” on social media due to its circular shape, as it raged a short distance from a Pemex oil platform.

Coming after a week of fatal heatwaves across the Pacific north-west, and the revelation that Exxon lobbyists boasted of their relationships with US lawmakers to an undercover Greenpeace journalist, the fire has further ignited the ire of activists and lawmakers.

"“I didn’t think I’d ever get to go up.""

A trailblazing female pilot, denied the job of astronaut in the 1960s over her gender, is finally getting the chance to fulfil her dreams of going into space.

Billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has announced that 82-year-old Wally Funk will be part of a four-person crew set to be launched into space by Blue Origin during a 10-minute flight on his rocket New Shepard later this month.

Funk, who says she taught over 3,000 people to fly, will be the oldest person ever to travel into space, after the late John Glenn set the current record at age 77 while aboard space shuttle Discovery in 1998.

In 1961, Funk volunteered to be part of a program to get women to qualify for Nasa’s astronaut program, but it was abruptly cancelled when the federal government decided women shouldn’t be allowed to use the military facilities needed for space training.

None of the women ever made it into space – but now, Funk has the opportunity to do so on 20 July.

“No one has waited longer,” said Bezos in his post, calling Funk an “honored guest”.

"Statues of Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II have been toppled in Canada amid growing outrage over the discovery of unmarked graves belonging to Indigenous children.

A group gathered at the Manitoba legislature in Winnipeg and pulled down the statue of Victoria on Canada Day – an annual celebration on 1 July that marks the country’s confederation.

Protesters have increasingly targeted historical figures that they see as complicit in the establishment and operation of the notorious residential schools where the remains of children have been found.

Members of the group covered the statue and its plinth in red handprints and left a sign that read: “We were children once. Bring them home.”

During the 19th and 20th centuries, at least 150,000 Indigenous children were taken from their families to attend the residential schools as part of a campaign by the government to forcefully assimilate the children into Canadian society.

"An NFT of the original source code for the world wide web, written by its inventor Tim Berners-Lee, has sold for $5.4m in an online auction.

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a kind of crypto asset that records ownership of digital items, and has recently become a major asset in the creative world, with NFTs of artwork, music and internet memes selling for millions of dollars.

The NFT represents ownership of various digital items from when he invented the world wide web in 1989.

It is considered valuable by some because its basis in the blockchain authenticates that it is one-of-a-kind and has been officially created, or “minted”, by Berners-Lee himself.

“The symbolism, the history, the fact that they’re coming from the creator is what makes them valuable, and there are lots of people who collect things for exactly those reasons,” said Cassandra Hatton, the global head of science and popular culture at Sotheby’s auction house.

Included in the purchase are NFTs representing about 9,555 lines of code written in 1990-1991, a 30-minute animated visualisation of the code, a digital poster of the code, and a digital letter written by Berners-Lee in June 2021, reflecting on his invention.

The letter begins: “As people seemed to appreciate autographed versions of books, now we have NFT technology, I thought it could be fun to make an autographed copy of the original code of the first web browser.”

"Just a week after Britney Spears's emotional speech calling for an end to her 'abusive' conservatorship, a judge has denied the request to remove her father from his role overseeing the unusual legal arrangement.

The decision is not a direct response to the 39-year-old’s most recent testimony. The documents were filed in a response to a request Spears’s attorney made last year to remove her father as sole conservator. At the time, her attorney, said Spears was “afraid” of her father, Jamie Spears.

In November, Los Angeles superior court judge Brenda Penny declined to remove Jamie Spears and added a trust as the co-conservator of her estate. The documents filed on Wednesday affirm this decision and underline that her father is still a conservator.

In her first time speaking in open court last week, Spears said she wanted the conservatorship that has controlled her life and money for 13 years to end. She said she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship stopped her from removing a contraceptive device in order to try for another child.

Earlier this week, attorneys for Spears’s father filed a petition to ask the court to investigate claims Britney Spears made in her testimony last week. The filings asked the court to examine “serious allegations regarding forced labor, forced medical treatment and therapy, improper medical care, and limitations on personal rights.”

The next hearing in the case is scheduled for 14 July, though experts have warned there could be a long fight ahead for Spears to get out of the very complex legal arrangement. Follow the link in bio to find out why.",2021-07-01 19:02:56
"At least 486 sudden deaths were reported over five days during British Columbia’s unprecedented heatwave - suggesting the extreme weather that affected western Canada in recent days was far deadlier than initially believed.

Typically, 165 sudden deaths would occur in the province over that period, the province’s chief coroner said, suggesting more than 300 deaths could be attributed to the heat. The new tally, announced on Wednesday, marks a 195% increase over normal years.

“Our thoughts are with people who have lost loved ones” said prime minister Justin Trudeau, warning the blistering temperatures in a region of the country ill-prepared for such heat was a reminder of the need to address climate change.

Many of those who died over the five day period were seniors, lived alone and were found in residences that were hot and not well ventilated, officials said.

The town of Lytton, British Columbia reached 49.5C (121.1F) on Tuesday, smashing the national record three days in a row. Lytton was evacuated on last night after a fire hit the town and threatened residential buildings.

The “heat dome” that blanketed much of western Canada and the United States broke 103 heat records across British Columbia, Alberta, Yukon and Northwest Territories on Monday.

Experts say the heat was so dangerous because it persisted throughout the night in many communities, giving residents little relief. Because of its typically mild climate, residents along the Pacific Coast often don’t install air conditioning units.

"The surprise reversal of Bill Cosby’s sexual assault conviction by Pennsylvania’s highest court has drawn widespread shock and fury – particularly in and around Hollywood, where the comedian was once a sitcom titan known as “America’s Dad”.

“I am furious to hear this news,” wrote the actor Amber Tamblyn on Twitter. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants star, who has been open on social media with her own experiences with sexual assault, added that she personally knew “women who this man drugged and raped while unconscious. Shame on the court and this decision” along with the hashtags #TimesUp and #MeToo.

“THIS is why women do not come forward,” tweeted the longtime advice columnist E Jean Carroll, who herself is one of several women to have credibly accused Donald Trump of sexual assault. (Carroll has since sued Trump for defamation.)

Cosby, 83, was arrested in 2015 and convicted in 2018 of drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, a Temple University employee, at his suburban estate in 2004. The sitcom star has served more than two years of his three- to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia. He vowed to serve all 10 years rather than acknowledge any remorse for his actions with Constand.

Cosby’s conviction was overturned on a legal technicality.

Justice David Wecht wrote that Cosby had relied on the former prosecutor’s decision not to charge him when he gave potentially incriminating testimony in Constand’s prior civil suit. The reversal could make prosecutors wary of calling other accusers in similar cases.

Cosby’s trial, held after more than 50 women came forward with stories of being drugged and assaulted by the comedian, was the first significant celebrity conviction of the #MeToo era. It was widely seen as symbolic of how powerful men could finally be held to account.

Its reversal prompted several expressions of grief after a hard-won victory for #MeToo supporters. “Heartbreaking for all survivors. #MeToo lasts forever,” tweeted Ellen Barkin.

An unprecedented wave of lawsuits, filed by cities and states across the US, aim to hold the oil and gas industry to account for the environmental devastation caused by fossil fuels – and covering up what they knew along the way.

Coastal cities struggling to keep rising sea levels at bay, midwestern states watching “mega-rains” destroy crops and homes, and fishing communities losing catches to warming waters, are now demanding the oil conglomerates pay damages and take urgent action to reduce further harm from burning fossil fuels.

"What do you think of cars flying above us in less than 10 years time?

According to a leading car manufacturer, flying cars will be a reality in cities around the globe by the end of this decade, and will help to reduce congestion and cut vehicle emissions.

Michael Cole, the chief executive of the European operations of South Korean carmaker Hyundai, said the firm had made some “very significant investments” in urban air mobility, adding: “We believe it really is part of the future”.

He told an industry conference: “It’s part of our future solution of offering innovative, smart mobility solutions.”

Hyundai showcased its flying car concept, developed in conjunction with the ride-sharing firm Uber, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2020.

The company is also involved in the UK’s first airport without a runway, designed for aircraft that are capable of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL), scheduled to open in Coventry later this year.

The “urban airport” could be used by aircraft including air taxis and autonomous delivery drones.

"In a world-first that has delighted conservationists, a baby gorilla has been born in the wild in west Africa from two parents who grew up in captivity in Europe.

The baby's mother Mayombe, 13, was born in the ZooParc de Beauval in France, while 15-year-old father Djongo was raised in the Port Lympne Safari Park in southeast England. Both were later introduced to the wild.

The newborn gorilla is thought to have been born on the night of 13 June in The Bateke Plateau National Park in the southeast of Gabon.

""It's extraordinary news, a very significant world-first for the conservation of this species which is in serious danger of becoming extinct,"" Delphine Delord, assistant director of Beauval zoo, told AFP.

The Aspinall Foundation, which runs the Port Lympne Safari Park, has reported the infant gorilla to be in good health. The foundation says on its website that the number of western lowland gorillas, which are found in Gabon, has declined by 60 percent in the past 20-25 years.

"French gay rights campaigners are celebrating a milestone for equal rights after parliament finalised adoption of a bill giving lesbian couples and single women access to fertility treatment for the first time.

Under current French law, only heterosexual couples have the right to access medically assisted procreation methods such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Lesbian couples and single women who want children have to travel abroad for IVF using donor sperm.

That is set to change under the bill pushed through by President Emmanuel Macron’s government, which passed a final vote in the National Assembly on Tuesday after two years of protests and 500 hours of debate.

The draft law, which was backed by 326 MPs to 115 against, with 42 abstentions, winds back some of western Europe’s strictest rules governing medically assisted pregnancies - and will make France the 11th country in the 27-member EU to allow medically assisted procreation for lesbian couples and single women alike.

The legislation also addresses several issues arising out of the huge increase in the use of fertility treatment in recent years.

Controversially, it allows children conceived with donor sperm to learn the donor’s identity when they become adults, ending the anonymity that donors in France have been guaranteed until now.

And it allows women in their 30s to freeze their eggs – a procedure currently available only to women undergoing treatment for conditions that could affect their fertility, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy for cancer.

But it stops short at legalising surrogacy, a practice used by some couples to have children that is still widely rejected in France.",2021-06-30 15:21:33
"England captain, Harry Kane, joined Germany's captain Manuel Neuer in wearing rainbow-coloured armbands for their match at Wembley last night to mark the end of Pride month and to show support for LGBTQ+ communities around the world.

It was the first time Kane has donned this armband - while Neuer has worn it for all his Euro 2020 matches in June. ""From our point of view it is a show of solidarity with the German national team from all of us at the England national team to be united in trying to kick out all inequalities there are,"" Kane said.

Earlier this month, Uefa investigated whether it could be viewed as a political statement before concluding there would be no disciplinary proceedings, given the armband was a “symbol of diversity"" and thus the German goalkeeper was “promoting a good cause”.

But last week, the governing body was criticised after ruling Munich’s Allianz Arena could not be lit up in rainbow colours to support LGBTQ+ rights for the evening’s match between Germany and Hungary because it contravened the governing body’s rules regarding political and religious neutrality. The city's mayor said he wanted to protest against a new law in Hungary that forbids gay people from featuring in educational materials in schools or TV shows for those under 18.

UEFA said the ""request itself was political"" and added the rainbow colours in its own logo, saying: ""It is a symbol that embodies our core values, promoting everything that we believe in – a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone, regardless of their background, belief, gender or sexual orientation.""

"Three years after she shocked the Democratic establishment and won her New York primary, AOC is continuing to hold her party to account – and not just from the inside. 

On Monday she joined a lively climate protest outside the White House. Organized by the Sunrise Movement, activists and a handful of Democratic politicians, including Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowma,n marched to put pressure on Joe Biden, who they believe is not doing enough to tackle the climate crisis.

Along with other progressive Democrats, they've been left disappointed by the infrastructure deal announced by the president last week which only includes trimmed down funding for climate change protections.

Responding to protesters chanting ""AOC!"", Ocasio-Cortez responded with her own chant – ""GND!"" – referencing the Green New Deal climate resolution that she introduced in 2019 with the Democratic senator Ed Markey (and recently re-introduced).

“They want you to think, ‘Oh, this is a new idea, this is too ambitious, this is too crazy.’ How about this? The last time we introduced the Civilian Climate Corps in this country, we hired and mobilized a quarter-million people in three months,” Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd, referring to the program that was introduced under Franklin D Roosevelt's tranformative New Deal in 1933.

“We’re going to get that into this infrastructure bill,” she added.

"A weight-loss tool that uses magnets to stop people from opening their mouths wide enough to eat solid food has been developed by scientists in order to tackle obesity.

The device, developed by medical professionals from the University of Otago in New Zealand and scientists from Leeds in the UK, can be fitted by dentists and uses magnetic components with locking bolts.

It has been criticised online, however, with people likening it to a medieval torture device and some thought, at first, it may have been a parody.

The University of Otago tweeted that it was “a world-first” weight-loss device “to help fight the global obesity epidemic: an intra-oral device that restricts a person to a liquid diet.”

Called the DentalSlim Diet Control, the device allows its users to open their mouths only 2mm wide. Initially, it was trialled on seven otherwise healthy obese women from Dunedin in New Zealand for two weeks, who were given a low-calorie liquid diet.

An article published in the British Dental Journal reported that the group of women lost a mean amount of 6.36kg – about 5.1% of their body weight.

But participants complained that the device was hard to use, causing discomfort with their speech. They said they felt tense and that “life in general was less satisfying”.

The University of Otago said: “To clarify, the intention of the device is not intended as a quick or long-term weight-loss tool. Rather, it is aimed to assist people who need to undergo surgery and who cannot have the surgery until they have lost weight.”

"From @guardian_us: Gavin Grimm filed a federal lawsuit in 2015 after he was denied entry to the men's bathrooms at his school. And now, six years later, he has finally been able to declare victory.

This is because the US supreme court has rejected a Virginia school board’s attempt to reinstate a transgender bathroom ban. The justices left in place lower-court rulings that found the policy unconstitutional.

""I am glad that my years-long fight to have my school see me for who I am is over. Being forced to use the nurse's room, a private bathroom, and the girl's room was humiliating for me, and having to go to out-of-the-way bathrooms severely interfered with my education,"" Grimm said in a statement.

""Trans youth deserve to use the bathroom in peace without being humiliated and stigmatized by their own school boards and elected officials,"" he added.

Last August, the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit ruled that the board had practiced sex-based discrimination and violated Grimm’s 14th amendment rights by prohibiting him from using the boys’ restroom.

Judge Henry Floyd wrote: “The proudest moments of the federal judiciary have been when we affirm the burgeoning values of our bright youth, rather than preserve the prejudices of the past.”

Upholding the decision of the appeals court sets a strong legal precedent. But because the supreme court has chosen not to hear the case itself, there is still no nationwide ruling on the issue.",2021-06-29 15:00:29

"Cambodian authorities have confiscated a defanged and declawed pet lion that appeared in TikTok videos taken at a villa in the wealthy Boeung Keng Kang district of the capital Phnom Penh.

The owner had shared a photo of the lion sitting in a driveway as a dog played nearby. There was also a video of it as a young cub being sprayed down with a hose. The confiscation comes a day after a Twitter user posted an aerial shot of the creature roaming around a garden.

Wildlife Alliance, an animal rescue non-government organisation that helped with the raid, said the conditions of a private residence were “inappropriate for a wild animal”. “In addition, the lion’s canine teeth had been removed, along with its claws, which drastically reduces a lion’s quality of life,” it said.

The 18-month-old male, weighing 70kg (154lbs), had been imported from overseas by the owner, a Chinese national, to be raised in his home, environment ministry spokesman Neth Pheaktra said.

“Cambodian authorities started investigating this lion since we saw it on TikTok in late April,” Pheaktra said on Sunday. “People have no right to raise rare wildlife as pets.”

The animal will now be moved to the Phnom Tamao wildlife rescue centre on the outskirts of the capital.

"This brings new meaning to the phrase 'neighbourhood, watch ...'

This tree - which was cleaved in half - has become an attraction in a residential part of South Yorkshire after a dispute between neighbours.

Bharat Mistry, 56, said he had been embroiled in a year-long dispute with the family next door over birds roosting in the tree, which they said generated too much noise and mess in the drive of their bungalow.

Their next-door neighbours then asked tree surgeons to cut down half the branches of the 5 metre conifer tree that had stood in his garden in the Sheffield suburb of Waterthorpe for 25 years.

Without Mistry’s knowledge, an image of the tree was posted on Reddit with the title: “Some traditional British pettiness on display.” The image and account have since been deleted, but not before going viral. One user on Twitter wrote: ""This is the pettiest thing I have ever seen and I love it.""

Mistry said he had trimmed the tree into a ball shape, which his neighbour had agreed with until birds began roosting in the tree. He said their relations had previously been amicable and he had trimmed the branches lower down the tree to make space for the neighbours’ car.

Mistry, who lives in a three-bedroom property with his wife and two daughters, asked the neighbours not to have the branches removed, but acknowledged they were entitled to do so as the tree protruded by a metre on to their property.

The neighbours have refused requests to comment.

One woman who wished to remain anonymous said: “When I saw it, I just thought: ‘Oh my God, what a shame.’ It’s a lovely tree and adds to the feature of the house and the street.” Another neighbour who did not want to be named said: “It ruins the visual aspect for everyone.”

"This skull just forced scientists to rewrite the history of human evolution. 

Analysis of the remains has revealed a new branch of the human family tree that points to a previously unknown sister group more closely related to modern humans than the Neanderthals.

The extraordinary fossil has been named a new human species, Homo longi or “Dragon man”, by Chinese researchers, although other experts are more cautious about the designation.

“I think this is one of the most important finds of the past 50 years,” said Prof Chris Stringer, research leader at the Natural History Museum in London, who worked on the project. “It’s a wonderfully preserved fossil.”

The skull appears to have a remarkable backstory. According to the researchers, it was originally found in 1933 by Chinese labourers building a bridge over the Songhua River in Harbin, in China’s northernmost province, Heilongjiang, during the Japanese occupation. To keep the skull from falling into Japanese hands it was wrapped and hidden in an abandoned well, resurfacing only in 2018 after the man who hid it told his grandson about it shortly before he died.

"Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who murdered George Floyd, has been sentenced to 22 years and six months for second-degree murder.

The 45-year-old appeared in court on Friday two months after a jury found him guilty on three charges related to Floyd’s death.

After four victim impact statements from members of the Floyd family, including his seven-year-old daughter Gianna, prosecutors argued before judge Peter Cahill that Chauvin should face the maximum sentence, for a first time offender, of 30 years for second-degree murder.

“Every day I have begged for justice to be served, reliving the execution of George, while others begged, they pleaded for officer Chauvin to simply just allow George to take a breath,” Floyd’s brother Philonise told the court before sentencing as he also requested the maximum sentence. “I haven’t had a real night’s sleep because of the nightmares I constantly have hearing my brother beg and plead for his life over and over again.”

Terrence Floyd, another of George Floyd’s brothers, directly addressed the former officer, who appeared in court wearing a grey suit with a shaved head.

“I wanted to know from the man himself [Chauvin] why? What were you thinking? What was going through your head when you had your knee on my brother’s neck. When you knew that he posed no threat any more, he was handcuffed, why you didn’t at least get up, why you stayed there?”

Chauvin himself spoke briefly to the court before he was sentenced, suggesting that “additional legal matters” prevented him from speaking at length.

“Very briefly though, I want to give my condolences to the Floyd family, there’s going to be some other information in the future that would be of interest, and I hope some things would give you some peace of mind,” he said.

"The latest flare-up of violence in the Gaza Strip has been accompanied by a “catalogue of violations” committed by Israeli police against Palestinians in Israel and occupied East Jerusalem, according to research from Amnesty International.

Arab citizens of Israel have been subjected to unlawful force from officers during peaceful demonstrations, sweeping mass arrests, torture and other ill-treatment in detention, and police have failed to protect Palestinians from premeditated attacks by rightwing Jewish extremists, the human rights watchdog has said.

Two Israeli police spokespeople have not yet responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment.

Saleh Hijazi, Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for the Middle East and north Africa, said Palestinians face a culture of increasing repression and violence from the Israeli authorities and the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank.

“There are always periods where the institutionalised structural violence and discrimination against Palestinians becomes severe, but this is the worst it has been in a long time. There is a complete disregard for civilian life,” Hijazi said.

Amnesty researchers documented more than 20 cases of Israeli police violence since early May, when protests against the eviction of Palestinians from the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah began. The unrest became one of the triggers for a new round of confrontation between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been injured in the police crackdown, and a 17-year-old boy shot dead, during mostly peaceful demonstrations in Israeli cities and East Jerusalem over the last six weeks.

"Ingeborg Beugel is a freelance correspondent for Dutch media who has lived on the island Hydra for almost 40 years. On 13 June, she was arrested and accused of “facilitating the illegal stay of a foreigner in Greece” after hosting an Afghan asylum seeker in her home.

Beugel, 61, said Fridoon, 23 - whose full name we are not sharing for privacy reasons - had been staying with her while appealing against a negative asylum decision. She said his original application for asylum in Greece was rejected because of translation problems at his interview.

Beugel said it was not a secret that Fridoon had been staying with her and that she has covered his story as a journalist. She believes her arrest was in line with other complaints about police and the Greek authorities harassing journalists.

Beugel could now face up to a year in prison if charged and convicted. Her lawyer, said the crime she had been charged with was most often used when prosecuting smuggling cases - and represents a “toughening” of the official response to refugees and asylum seekers in Greece.

The Greek authorities have been approached for comment.

The country, like other EU states, stands accused of pushbacks of migrants and refugees.

Last month, Guardian analysis found that EU member states used illegal operations to push back at least 40,000 asylum seekers from Europe’s borders during the pandemic, methods being linked to the death of more than 2,000 people.

The UK government has today confirmed it is to introduce a pre-9pm ban on junk food advertising on TV and tighten restrictions online by 2023.

It comes as Boris Johnson looks to deliver on his pledge to tackle the nation's growing obesity crisis. The prime minister is said to blame his own health issues for contributing to his hospitalisation with coronavirus last year.

The rules, which will ban the advertising of products deemed to be high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS), have been branded as “draconian” by the advertising industry - and could cost TV broadcasters such as ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky more than £200m a year in revenue.

The tightening of restrictions online mean that paid-for ads on sites including Facebook and Google by big brands will also be banned. However, companies will be able to show marketing on their own websites and social media accounts.

Junk food advertising will still be allowed through audio media, such as podcasts and radio, and there will be no new restrictions for the out-of-home sector, which includes billboards, poster sites, on buses, and in locations such as railway stations and airports.

Some foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt that are not viewed as traditional “junk food”, like honey, Marmite and avocados, will still be allowed to feature in advertising.

Research has found that one in three children leaving primary school are overweight or obese, as are almost two-thirds of adults in England.

"This injured young woman was pictured surrounded by medical personnel arriving on a stretcher to the Ayder referral hospital in Mekele - a day after a deadly airstrike on a market in Ethiopia's war-torn northern Tigray region, where a seven-month-old conflict has surged again.

At least 64 people were killed and 180 injured in an Ethiopian air strike on the busy market in Togoga town on Tuesday, about 20km west of Mekele, the capital of Tigray region, according to a local health officer.

Ethiopia’s army spokesman said today that the military carried out the attack, but that rebel fighters were the target. Survivors and health workers, however, said dozens were killed or wounded, including children, by the aerial explosions at the peak of trading.

The attack came as vote counting was underway following Monday’s national elections in Ethiopia - though the conflict in Tigray meant no vote was held there, and the region has seen an upsurge in fighting in recent days.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops to Tigray in November to oust the dissident regional leadership, promising a swift victory. But nearly eight months later, fighting continues, which has triggered a humanitarian crisis with the UN warning 350,000 people are on the brink of famine.

Several Bundesliga clubs, including Wolfsburg, Hertha Berlin, Eintracht Frankfurt and Cologne, all went ahead with the display during the game last night in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community, in particular in Hungary - where legislation was passed last week by its parliament banning school educational materials or TV shows for under-18s that the government considers to be promoting homosexuality or gender change.

The planned illumination of Allianz Arena for the match was requested by Munich city council and LGBTQ+ activists to “send a signal of support for inclusivity and diversity”.

But, Uefa said the rainbow lights would contravene its rules about political and religious neutrality so the protest at the stadium couldn’t go ahead. Days earlier it had ruled that the German team’s captain, Manuel Neuer, had not contravened those rules by wearing a rainbow armband.

Instead of the planned display, the mayor of Munich instead illuminated a wind turbine by the ground. Swipe to see a selection of the best pictures of the rainbow stadiums and more.

"Britney Spears has called for an end to the “abusive” conservatorship that has governed her life for 13 years, delivering an emotional speech to a Los Angeles court.

Spears addressed the court during a hearing on the unusual legal arrangement that has stripped the singer of her independence since 2008. The conservatorship has given her father, Jamie Spears, control over her estate, career and other aspects of her personal life.

“I want to end this conservatorship without being evaluated,” Spears said in a lengthy speech, during which she condemned her father and the others who have controlled the arrangement.

“This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,” she said. “I deserve to have a life.”

Spears said has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and having a baby. She said she wanted to get her birth control removed so she could try to have another child, but that she was not allowed to go to the doctor.

"Despite devastating economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of millionaires in the world has increased.

There are now 56.1 million millionaires globally, up by 5.2 million people, according to the annual Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report.

The figures capture how the rich cashed in on surging stock and house prices - and how emergency interest rate cuts and government stimulus measures often benefited those least in need of state support, helping their assets grow in value despite the downturn.

According to the latest edition of the International Labor Organization (ILO) Monitor, which was published at the beginning of the year, 114 million jobs were lost in 2020, which, in combination with working-hour reductions within employment, resulted in working-hour losses approximately four times as high as during the financial crisis in 2009.

The ILO estimates that the working hours lost in 2020 (compared to pre-pandemic levels) were equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs, leading to $3.7 trillion in lost labor income.

"Young female footballers are being excluded from matches because of their religious dress.

The French Football Federation (FFF) has banned women from wearing the hijab in official club matches, as well as during international games.

A controversial bill is being considered by parliament, which includes a ban on women under the age of 18 wearing the hijab in public places. Critics say this would further stigmatise the estimated 5.7 million Muslims living in France – and is an example of the continual attacks on religious freedoms over the last two decades.

Les Hijabeuses – a growing collective of young hijab-wearing players – are campaigning against the FFF’s ban as part of a wider battle to promote a more inclusive society in the country, where there has been a rise in far-right groups and Islamophobia.

"First there was the bread ... now it's contents. 

A lab test commissioned by the New York Times has failed to identify any tuna DNA in a series of Subway tuna sandwiches.

A reporter acquired “more than 60 inches worth of Subway tuna sandwiches” from three Los Angeles storefronts, then engaged a specialized fish-testing lab. Researchers were unable to pinpoint a species.

“There’s two conclusions,” a lab spokesperson told the Times. “One, it’s so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out, we couldn’t make an identification ...

""Or we got some and there’s just nothing there that’s tuna.”

In February, when Inside Edition ran a similar test based on samples from New York, a Florida-based lab did confirm the presence of tuna.

In January, two California customers filed a lawsuit claiming the products “are made from anything but tuna”. Subway has fiercely defended the integrity of its tuna supply, calling the recent lawsuit “baseless”. 

The fast food franchise, which has more than 22,000 storefronts across the US and operates in 110 countries and territories, has been dogged by legal action, including a class-action complaint that said its $5 foot-long sandwiches were in fact only 11 to 11.5in long. 

In October last year, an Irish court also ruled that the bread served at Subway could not in fact be defined as bread because of its high sugar content.

Other sandwich makers have also pointed out that tuna is a relatively inexpensive meat, so Subway has little incentive to substitute a cheaper version. And seafood experts have suggested Subway may not be to blame if its tuna is in fact not tuna.

“I don’t think a sandwich place would intentionally mislabel,” Dave Rudie, president of Catalina Offshore Products, told the Times. “They’re buying a can of tuna that says ‘tuna’. If there’s any fraud in this case, it happened at the cannery.”",2021-06-23 15:00:36
"From espresso to instant, coffee is part of the daily routine for so many of us ... Now research suggests the drink could be linked to a lower chance of developing or dying from chronic liver disease.

The new UK analysis is the latest to suggest drinking coffee could bring benefits, with previous work suggesting it may help stave off liver cancer, and reduce the risk of alcohol-related liver disease.

The study analysed data from 494,585 participants, aged between 40 to 69 when signing up - including 384,818 who were coffee drinkers at the outset compared with 109,767 who did not consume the beverage.

Looking at the liver health of the participants over a median period of almost 11 years, the researchers found 3,600 cases of chronic liver disease, with 301 deaths, and 1,839 cases of simple fatty liver disease.

The analysis revealed that after taking into account factors such as body mass index, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, those who drank any amount of coffee, and of any sort, had a 20% lower risk of developing chronic liver disease or fatty liver disease (taken together) than those who did not consume the brew.

The coffee drinkers also had a 49% lower risk of dying from chronic liver disease.

Chronic liver disease is a major health problem around the world. According to the British Liver Trust, liver disease is the third leading cause of premature death in the UK, with deaths having risen 400% since 1970.

Vanessa Hebditch, of the @british_liver_trust, said the research added to a growing body of evidence that coffee was good for liver health.

But she stressed the importance of not just drinking coffee to improve their liver health, but also ""cutting down on alcohol and keeping to a healthy weight by exercising and eating well.”

"The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, has threatened to jail people who refuse to be vaccinated against coronavirus as the country battles one of Asia’s worst outbreaks, with a cumulative total of more than 1.3 million cases and 23,000 deaths.

""You choose: vaccine or I will have you jailed,"" Duterte said in a televised address on Monday following reports of low turnouts at several vaccination sites in the capital, Manila.

His remarks contradict those of his health officials, who have said that while people are being urged to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, it is voluntary. Duterte, who has been criticised for his tough approach to containing the virus, also stood by his decision not to let schools reopen.

In the same address, Duterte took a swipe at the international criminal court - the world’s only permanent war crimes court - after an ICC prosecutor had sought permission from the court for a full inquiry into the drug war killings in the Philippines.

Duterte, who in March 2018 cancelled the Philippines’ membership of the ICC’s founding treaty, repeated he would not cooperate with the investigation into allegations that police unlawfully killed as many as tens of thousands of civilians between 2016 and 2019.

“Why would I defend or face an accusation before white people. You must be crazy,” Duterte said, who after winning the presidency five years ago unleashed an anti-narcotics campaign that has killed thousands. Human rights groups say authorities have summarily executed drug suspects, but Duterte maintained those who were killed violently resisted arrest.

"Bumble, the dating app where women make the first move, has this week temporarily closed all of its offices and given staff a paid week off to help them deal with 'collective burnout' and stress.

Its 700 employees worldwide have been told to focus on themselves and switch off.

A spokeswoman for Bumble said a few customer support staff will be working, but will be given time off at a later date to ensure they get the break too.

Bumble says it has quite an unconventional office environment; employees have a free choice over the hours they work, as long as the work gets done - and their headquarters in Texas has a ""Mommy Bar"" which is described as a ""private lactation space"" by Ms Wolfe Herd, as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and blowouts.

"A Utah junior high school has been criticised for taking two official photos of its cheerleading squad, one which did not include the 14-year-old team’s manager with Down syndrome, and chose to use that image in its yearbook and on social media.

Shoreline junior high school cheer squad member Morgyn Arnold was seated in the front row in the first photo, whereas in the second image she was absent.

According to reports from the Salt Lake Tribune and the New York Times, Arnold’s older sister, Jordyn Poll, said Morgyn was crestfallen when she looked through the yearbook. Arnold’s name also wasn’t included. Poll reportedly said she thought this decision was because of her sibling’s disability.

While some on social media questioned the other cheerleaders, Arnold’s family urged people to stop “shaming, bullying and threats” targeting them, pointing out that they did not have any role in selecting this photo. “Those girls are nothing less than amazing,” Poll remarked. “They love Morgyn. They have done everything to help her and make her feel included. They have feelings, too.”

"This is the elephant in the room ... literally.

Ratchadawan Puengprasoppon was awoken in the early hours of Saturday morning by crashing and banging in her house in Thailand.

She discovered an elephant’s head poking through her kitchen wall beside the drying rack.

The male elephant, named Boonchuay, was rummaging through the kitchen drawers, knocking pans to the floor.

This isn't uncommon. “They come to visit quite often. They always come when there is the local market because they can smell food,” said Itthipon Thaimonkol, the park’s superintendent.

Dr Joshua Plotnik, an assistant professor of psychology at Hunter College, City University of New York, who studies the elephant population in the Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary in western Thailand, said: “In the villages in which I work in Thailand, elephants enter farmers’ cropfields almost nightly. This is a really difficult issue for both the farmers and the elephants.""

In China recently there was the story of a herd of elephants that travelled for 15 months far away from their natural habitat, eating entire fields of corn and destroying barns along the way.

“These incidences are increasing in Asia, and it is likely due to a decrease in available resources and an increase in human disturbances in the elephants’ habitat,” said Plotnik.

“If you don’t fulfil the elephants’ need for food, water and other resources in their natural habitat (or ensure they have them somewhere else), they will find ways around deterrents and access villages or cropfields in search of these resources.”

"'I am grateful and humbled by the kindness and support that has been given to me by so many.'

New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard is set to make history and headlines, plus attract a considerable amount of controversy, after being confirmed as the first transgender athlete to ever compete at the Olympic Games.

The 43-year-old will be a possible medal contender when she competes in the women’s super heavyweight category on 2 August.

But Hubbard’s inclusion will also frustrate those who believe she has an unfair advantage over her rivals, having gone through male puberty before transitioning in 2012, which may offer advantages in power and strength to athletes even after taking medication to suppress their testosterone levels.

The New Zealand Olympic Committee chief executive, Kereyn Smith, said Hubbard would be welcomed to the New Zealand team.

“As well as being among the world’s best for her event, Laurel has met the IWF eligibility criteria including those based on IOC guidelines for transgender athletes,” she said. “We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play.

“As the New Zealand team, we have a strong culture of ‘manaaki’ [respect] and inclusion and respect for all.""

Activists placed 500 red roses on Copacabana Beach commemorating the victims of the pandemic, and in protest against the government's response.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who downplayed the pandemic and resisted containment measures, is being investigated by a congressional inquiry as his administration has lagged behind in getting hold of vaccines but pushed the use of ineffective drugs such as chloroquine.

""At the head of the republic, there is a president who violated all sanitary norms from the beginning of the pandemic. He underestimated the lethal power of the virus, participated in anti-democratic public demonstrations, stimulating the agglomeration,"" said Antonio Carlos Costa, the president of NGO Rio de Paz who organised the roses.

Unlike Bolsonaro’s supporters, who have taken to the streets in demonstrations over the past year, anti-Bolsonaro protesters have refrained from gathering and preferred banging pots from their homes. However, as the death toll keeps averaging 2,000 a day, the public outcry has increased.

"""Octopuses and lobsters have feelings and should be included in the animal sentience bill"".

That is the argument put forward by a group of Conservative MPs who are part of the influential Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation.

The animal sentience bill, now at second reading stage in the House of Lords, recognises that fish and other vertebrates feel pain and should be protected, where possible, from suffering. However, the group of MPs has argued that some invertebrates are extremely intelligent and should be included in the bill.

A new report by the CAWF has found that the UK fishing fleet lands more than 420 million cephalopods and crustaceans each year. This is a total of 73,600 tonnes of crustaceans and 12,100 tonnes of cephalopods.

It is well known that octopuses are intelligent, and they have been found to be excellent at solving puzzles. The Netflix film My Octopus Teacher, released last year, brought the issue to a large audience, as hundreds of thousands of people were charmed by the relationship between human and inquisitive octopus.

The new animal sentience legislation will mean that any new government policy will have to take into account that vertebrate animals can experience feelings including pain or joy. This will be decided by a committee made up of animal experts from within the field.

Shabir Hussain Khan gives blood four to five times a year. His contribution is not only the highest in Kashmir, but in all of India.

Security in conflict-racked Kashmir can be uncertain, and hospitals often need blood donors. Before the pandemic, the Lancet reported that India had an unmet need of 40.9m units of blood a year. Coronavirus has worsened the situation.

To encourage other people to donate blood, Khan now runs awareness campaigns and organises medical camps throughout the year.

"A 'dark day for LGBTI rights and for Hungary'.

Hungary’s parliament has passed a law banning gay people from featuring in school educational materials or TV shows for under-18s, as the country’s ruling party intensified its campaign against gay rights.

The Hungarian legislation outlaws sharing information with under-18s that the government considers to be promoting homosexuality or gender change.

Companies and large organisations will also be banned from running adverts in solidarity with gay people, if they are deemed to target under-18s.

The law means that TV shows and films featuring gay characters, or even a rainbow flag, would be permitted only after the watershed

The national assembly passed the legislation by 157 votes to one, despite a boycott of the vote by some opposition politicians.

The outcome was never in doubt, as the ruling Fidesz party, led by prime minister Viktor Orbán, has a healthy majority and were supported by the far-right Jobbik party

The measures have been likened by critics to Russia’s 2013 law against “gay propaganda” that independent monitors say has increased social hostility and fuelled vigilante attacks against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in the EU country’s eastern neighbour

Currently plastics lose about 95% of their value as a material after a single use. Encouraging better collection and use of such waste is key to tackling the global plastic pollution problem.

Upcycling plastic bottles into more lucrative materials could make the recycling process far more attractive and effective.

About 1m plastic bottles are sold every minute around the world and just 14% are recycled. Currently even those bottles that are recycled can only be turned into opaque fibres for clothing or carpets.",2021-06-15 15:01:45

"This is the first time a member of Europe's most expensive royal family has said, 'no, thank you' to their tax-free salary.

The heir to the Dutch throne, has written to the country's prime minister to waive her right to €1.6m (£1.4m) a year in income and personal and household expenses because accepting it would make her feel “uncomfortable”.

Amalia, the eldest daughter of King Willem-Alexander, who on Thursday passed her school-leaving exams with distinction, said in a handwritten letter to Mark Rutte that she did not want to take up her allowance until she had proper royal duties.

"But what about yellow? 

To encourage better respect towards people’s boundaries, US event organizers are using colored accessories to help people communicate their comfort around physical touch.

As coronavirus restrictions continue to be lifted, many people have become less comfortable with physical acts of socializing – hugs, handshakes and everything in between.

While some are excited to begin up-close-and-personal socializing, others are fiercely protective of their physical space.

Hence, the creation of the color-coded accessories, sometimes stickers, lanyards or bracelets, to differentiate who is comfortable with what kind of touch.

Hosts of an event in Virginia handed out red, yellow, and green stickers to attendees, explaining that red means no physical contact wanted, yellow stickers are only OK with elbow contact, and green means that hugs are welcome.

"Amnesty International has collected new evidence of human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region of China, which it says has become a “dystopian hellscape” for hundreds of thousands of Muslims subjected to mass internment and torture.

The human rights organisation has collected more than 50 new accounts from Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities who claim to have been subjected to mass internment and torture in police stations and camps in the region.

Amnesty is calling for all camps housing Muslim and ethnic minorities across Xinjiang province to be closed and for the UN to investigate and bring those suspected of crimes under international law to account.

China has consistently denied all accusations of wrongdoing in Xinjiang and said the camps were designed to offer Chinese language lessons and job support, as well as to combat religious extremism.

The report from Amnesty adds mounting pressure on Chinese authorities and comes after British MPs passed a motion in April that declared China is committing genocide against the Uyghur people and other minorities in Xinjiang.

"What responsibility do you think the producers of takeaway packaging have?

The most comprehensive study ever done has found plastic items from our takeaway food and drink are the most widespread items polluting the seas.

Single-use bags, plastic bottles, food containers and food wrappers are the four most predominant items contaminating the ocean, making up almost half of the human-made waste, the researchers found.

Just 10 plastic products make up 75% of all ocean litter. This includes fishing gear, synthetic rope, industrial packaging, plastic lids, drinks cans, and glass bottles.

The scientists said identifying the key sources of ocean plastic made it clear where action was needed. They called for bans on some common throwaway items and for producers to be made to take more responsibility.

Action on plastic straws and cotton buds in Europe was welcome, the researchers said, but risked being a distraction from tackling far more common types of litter.

""We were not surprised about plastic being 80% of the litter, but the high proportion of takeaway items did surprise us, which will not just be McDonald’s litter, but water bottles, beverage bottles like Coca-Cola, and cans,” said Carmen Morales-Caselles, at the University of Cádiz, Spain, who led the new research.

"The Texas Republican congressman Louie Gohmert has asked a senior US government official if changing the moon’s orbit around the Earth, or the Earth’s orbit around the sun, might be a solution to tackle the climate crisis.

Bizarrely, the question was not posed to anyone from Nasa or even the Pentagon. Instead it was asked of a senior forestry service official during a House natural resources committee hearing on Tuesday.

Speaking with Jennifer Eberlien, associate deputy chief of the US Forest Service, Gohmert asked if it was possible to alter the orbits of the moon, or the Earth, as a way of combating climate change.

“I understand from what’s been testified to the Forest Service and the BLM [Bureau of Land Management], you want very much to work on the issue of climate change,” Gohmert said, adding that a past director of Nasa had once told him that orbits of the moon and the Earth were indeed changing.

“We know there’s been significant solar flare activity, and so … is there anything that the National Forest Service or BLM can do to change the course of the moon’s orbit, or the Earth’s orbit around the sun?” Gohmert asked. “Obviously that would have profound effects on our climate.”

Eberlien said she would have to “follow up with you on that one, Mr Gohmert.”

Though he seemed to be entirely earnest, some observers have posited that Gohmert was seeking to express a belief that climate change was a phenomenon of natural changes in the orbits of celestial bodies, and so any other efforts to address it would be futile.""

Groves, who won two silver medals at the Rio Games five years ago, announced her decision not to compete in a social media post on Wednesday night.

In a separate message posted on Thursday “for emphasis” and to “make them pervs quake in fear from the number of people supporting a statement that threatens their existence”, she made allegations about her treatment by an unnamed individual involved in the sport.

"Have you heard of a raccoon dog?

If you're in the UK, it might not be that long before you see one.

An exotic member of the fox family that is native to Japan, China and Siberia, raccoon dogs are one of the most destructive invasive species at risk of becoming established in Britain, experts say.

A “horizon scanning” study funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs identified the raccoon dog and the raccoon as the only mammals on a list of 20 invasive species likely to reach UK shores and destroy native wildlife or bring disease.

The animal was introduced into the old Soviet Union in the mid-20th century and historically farmed for fur. They escaped and have spread rapidly through continental Europe in recent years.

According to the Mammal Society, which is calling on people to report any sightings of the animals, the omnivorous species could pose a threat to rare native species including amphibians, small mammals and ground-nesting birds. Raccoon dogs can also transmit a number of diseases to humans, experts say.

Dr Stephanie Wray, the chair of the Mammal Society, said: “We need to be mindful of their potential impact on our native species and report any such sightings as soon as possible. You only have to look at the decimation of water vole numbers, which were already struggling with habitat loss before predation by invasive American mink, to see the damage which can be done over a relatively short period of time.”

"Bitcoin to buy your weekly groceries?

That's the way things are heading in El Salvador after it became the first country in the world to vote to officially classify the cryptocurrency as legal tender.

This means that every business now must accept Bitcoin in exchange for goods or services, unless it can't provide the technology needed for the transaction.

Bitcoin - a digital currency - is essentially a computer file which is stored in a digital wallet app. Every transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain.

President Nayib Bukele said the government had made history, and that the move would make it easier for Salvadoreans living abroad to send money home.

""It will bring financial inclusion, investment, tourism, innovation and economic development for our country,"" Bukele said. He has previously said the move will open up financial services to the 70% of Salvadoreans who do not have bank accounts.

El Salvador's economy relies heavily on money sent home from abroad, which make up around 20% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), with over £2.8bn sent back to the central American nation each year.

They were both born in Australia, but after their mother, Priya, and father, Nades, visas had expired in 2018 they were taken from their Queensland home and put into immigration detention.

Only allowed half an hour outside a day in the early months of detention, Tharnicaa and Kopika became vitamin D deficient and prone to repeated infections. Tharnicaa was two when her teeth were so rotten she needed surgery to have two of them removed.

Since late 2019, their family has been held on Christmas Island while they challenged the Australian government’s attempt to send them to Sri Lanka. The Island formerly housed thousands of refugees and asylum seekers, who were held there after successive Australian governments declared that nobody who arrived by boat, including refugees fleeing persecution, would be allowed to settle in Australia. The detention centre closed in 2018 but it was reopened the following year.

Last month, Tharnicaa began suffering fever, vomiting, diarrhoea and dizziness - and on Monday, she was evacuated to Perth for emergency medical care. It was more than two weeks after her mother, Priya Nadasalingam, first alerted doctors that her daughter was unwell.

"What is a ""Peequal"", you ask? Swipe to the second slide and you'll see for yourself.

It's a new boat-shaped urinal where six women can pee at once in a circular configuration - and is being billed as the solution for all the women suffering through long waits for public toilets.

Designers and recent Bristol University graduates, Amber Probyn and Hazel McShane, came up with the idea while they were at a music festival.

According to their research, women queue up to 34 times longer than men because there are around 10 male urinals for every women’s public toilet.

The flatpack toilets are made from 100% recycled material and can be fully recycled - and it’s a “hands-free” arrangement that the designers call a pedestal. “It’s designed like a boat to minimise splashback,” says McShane, “and also to have a little place for your clothing in front.”

The Peequal is private from the waist down, so your top half is still visible above the partition.

"Rupert Everett died in 2019 aged 74 without an apology from the UK government for their repeated errors that caused him to be wrongly classified as an illegal immigrant and threatened with arrest, prison and forcible removal, the parliamentary ombudsman has found.

Everett's daughters said he was distressed to have his passport confiscated by immigration officials in 2016, and was terrified at the prospect of being forcibly returned to Jamaica, a country he had visited only twice since leaving in 1962, aged 19.

The latest critical official report on the Home Office's handling of the Windrush scandal detailed how Everett, a former HGV driver who lived in the UK for more than 50 years, died without having received an apology or compensation from the government.

Ombudsman Rob Behrens, who was asked to investigate the case after attempts to complain through the official complaints mechanism failed, said: “A well-loved father and grandfather spent the last years of his life in severe depression and anxiety because he was being wrongfully pursued and threatened by Immigration Enforcement.

Everett’s daughter, Fiona, said her father became withdrawn and isolated after the Home Office told him he was an immigration offender. “We haven’t had an explanation or an apology. It wasn’t one person that messed up, it was five departments,” she said.

Sukhdeep Singh, caseworker at the Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, who has helped more than 40 Windrush victims, said this was one of the worst cases he had encountered because Everett had clear documentary proof of his right to be in the UK, but officials ignored the evidence.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “The victims of the Windrush scandal faced appalling treatment and we are determined to right these wrongs. We are considering the ombudsman’s findings and offer our sincere condolences to Mr Everett’s loved ones for their loss.”

"Our closest relatives, the great apes, are predicted to lose a devastating 90% of their homelands in Africa over the next 30 years, according to a new study.

All gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos are already endangered or critically endangered. But a combination of the climate crisis, the destruction of wild areas for minerals, timber and food, and human population growth is on track to decimate their ranges by 2050, the scientists said.

The study analysed data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s apes database on species populations, threats and conservation action at hundreds of sites over 20 years. It then modelled the combined future impacts of global heating, habitat destruction and human population growth.

“If we add climate change to the current causes of territory loss, the picture looks devastating,” said Joana Carvalho, a biologist and computer modeller at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and who led the study.

Some new areas will become climatically suitable for the apes, but the researchers doubt they will be able to migrate into these regions in time.

The biggest protection for great apes could come from consumers in rich nations demanding sustainably produced goods. Currently the export of minerals for mobile phones, timber, and palm oil are major drivers of great ape population falls.

"""I know what it is like to shoot without an intimacy director. The messy, embarrassing feeling for the crew. The internal devastation for the actor."" 

Michaela Coel and her hit drama I May Destroy You won big at the 2021 television Baftas last night, with Coel dedicating her best actress award to the series’ intimacy coordinator, Ita O’Brien.

Accepting awards for a show that dealt with sexual abuse and consent, Coel said film and television sets were vulnerable places for actors and crew members. Not to have intimacy experts was “thoughtless” and showed a “lack of mindfulness”, she added.

I May Destroy You was one of the cultural events of 2020, in any genre. The series was inspired by Coel’s own experience of sexual assault by strangers after her drink was spiked. It is about the aftermath of a rape and is often called a “a sexual consent drama” but it is also a story of fun, friendship and more.

"It's the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre that is believed to have left thousands of Chinese pro-democracy protesters dead, and for the first time in decades Hong Kong's Victoria Park is almost silent.

Thousands of police were deployed on Friday to enforce a ban on the city’s traditional candlelight vigil, which has drawn huge crowds to the park on 4 June for more than thirty years. The day has traditionally served as a display of pro-democracy people power that China has made clear it will no longer tolerate.

Authorities banned this year’s gathering citing the coronavirus pandemic – although Hong Kong has not recorded an untraceable local transmission in more than a month, and held large public events. Police have also cited the national security law in warning people not to gather for unnamed events, and reminded the public of the recent convictions of some activists.

Police say that thousands of officers will be on standby to halt any “unlawful assemblies” while officials have also warned that a sweeping new national security law could be wielded against Tiananmen mourners.

While last year’s vigil was also denied permission because of the pandemic, thousands simply defied the ban.

But much has changed in Hong Kong over the last year as authorities seek to snuff out the city’s pro-democracy movement using the security law to criminalise much dissent. 

Veteran political journalist Ching Cheong, who was jailed in China for three years, said the perseverance of Hong Kong in holding the vigil had made it “the conscience of China”.

“It’s very sad to see that, starting last year, authorities have tried to stamp out memorial activity purely for the selfish sake of the CCP to cling to power,” Ching said.

“I don’t think marking the anniversary of the crackdown itself will lead to the collapse of the communist regime, but it’s evident proof the regime is extremely afraid of people knowing the atrocities that it has committed.”

"How did you feel when Colston's statue was toppled?

This is the question written above the sculpture in a museum in Bristol.

The defaced bronze memorial to the 17th-century slave trader had stood in the city since 1895, but was pulled from its plinth during Black Lives Matter demonstrations on 7 June last year.

It was dragged through the city to the harbourside, where it was thrown in the water at Pero’s Bridge, which is named in honour of Pero Jones, an enslaved man who lived and died in the city.

On Friday, almost exactly a year since it was toppled, the bronze will go on public display at the M Shed museum, alongside placards from the protest and a timeline of events.

The statue, featuring graffiti and damage from when it was pulled down, is displayed lying on a wooden stand.

The public are being asked what should happen to it next.

Options include removing the statue from public view entirely, creating a museum or exhibition about the transatlantic slave trade, or restoring the statue to its plinth.

What do you think should happen next?

"Colombo is bracing for the impact of a sinking cargo ship in what Sri Lankan environmentalist Nayanaka Ranwella bleakly said could be “the death of our sea.”

Efforts have been made over the past two weeks to control a blaze on the ship which was carrying 278 tonnes of bunker fuel oil and other dangerous substances. Attempts included a salvage crew trying to tow the vessel to deeper water before it got stuck on a sea bed and started to sink.

The ship's operators said in a statement yesterday that there were no signs oil had leaked from the ship. However, burned debris and microplastics have washed up along Sri Lankan shores, requiring the navy to conduct a clean-up operation.

"Is 70 the new 50?

This 71-year-old model thinks so. Sarah Grant donned a swimsuit to make her Australian fashion week runway debut on Thursday.

“It’s great for older women to see a more mature person wearing an outfit because then they can relate to it, and it’s good for business because baby boomers are one of the largest demographics when it comes to buying fashion,” Grant says.

Grant may be new to Australian fashion week but she is a veteran of international modelling. Her first catwalk appearance was for Pierre Cardin in New Zealand at the age of 16.

Valentino, Karl Lagerfeld and Zandra Rhodes were among the brands she walked for in Paris, Milan and London before returning to Australia, where she appeared on the cover of Playboy with an electric guitar in the 70s.

Grant says the modelling industry has changed immensely since she got her first big break in the 60s. “We were all just regular sizes – a size 10 or size 12 – so there wasn’t that pressure to be slim. When the super skinny look came in it was really tragic for the business and a lot of girls ended up with issues because of it.”

"2021 vs 1921: the Tulsa race massacre took place 100 years ago this week, and still stands as one of the worst incidents of racial violence in US history.

Between 31 May-1 June 1921, white residents, peace officers and soldiers attacked the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Oklahoma, one of the wealthiest Black communities in the US. An an estimated 300 people died – mostly Black people – displacing upwards of 1,000 and inflicting irrevocable economic damage to a thriving business district created by and for Black Americans.

It's believed to have been the first time that bombs were dropped on an American community, and the actions undertaken by the white citizens, who received significant resistance from both everyday Black civilians and Black soldiers recently returned from the first world war, wasn't taught in Oklahoma school books and barely mentioned in national textbooks for generations afterwards.

In the images above, artist and filmmaker Bayeté Ross Smith (@bayetekenan) allows us to revisit the scene of the atrocity by overlaying photos from 1921 over present-day Tulsa. They help us to place the massacre more concretely, but also serve as a reminder that the past is very rarely past at all, despite America's efforts to forget it.

"What exactly is 'race-norming'?

It's a practice developed in medicine and adopted by the NFL when settling concussion lawsuits that assumed Black players had a lower level of cognitive function.

The American football league has now pledged to stop using the race-based formula when assessing payouts in its $1 billion settlement of brain injury claims - and also promised to review previous brain injury claims that have been settled through race-norming.

The decision comes after a pair of Black players filed a civil rights lawsuit over the practice, which began in the 1990s.

The standards were created in hopes of offering more appropriate treatment to dementia patients, but critics faulted the way the NFL used them to assess legal damages, saying it was harder for Black American football players to show a deficit and qualify for an award.

More than 2,000 NFL retirees have filed dementia claims, but fewer than 600 have received awards, according to the most recent report. More than half of all NFL retirees are Black, according to lawyers involved in the litigation.

The NFL noted that the norms were developed in medicine “to stop bias in testing, not perpetrate it” and added the practice was never mandatory, but left to the discretion of doctors taking part in the settlement program.

"""It's not something, on behalf of our Black players, that I wanted to hear, because it feels as though it's a criticism of them"" - England manager Gareth Southgate has hit out at the section of fans who booed when his players took the knee before their friendly against Austria in Middlesborough last night.

Southgate cut an angry figure after the anti-racism gesture was greeted by loud boos just before kick-off. The manager defended his players and stressed the act of taking a knee should not be seen as a political message.

Bukayo Saka, 19, who earned England victory with his first goal at international level said: “I don’t understand why they did it ... I heard some boos and I heard some claps. But you’ll have to ask the fans that were booing to understand why they did it.”

"More than six years after Houthi rebels seized Yemen's capital and forced its government into exile, a bloody civil war still rages across the country. Despite a Saudi-led bombing campaign that has destroyed Yemeni infrastructure and crippled its economy, the Houthis remain in control of most of the country's population centres.

"From county officials and sheriffs to governors and senators, white male minority rule pervades politics in the United States, according to a new report shared exclusively with @guardian_us.

White men represent 30% of the population but 62% of officeholders, dominating both chambers of Congress, 42 state legislatures and statewide roles across the nation, the analysis shows.

By contrast, women and people of colour constitute 51% and 40% of the US population respectively, but just 31% and 13% of officeholders, according to the research by the Reflective Democracy Campaign.

“I think if we saw these numbers in another country, we would say there is something very wrong with that political system,” said Brenda Choresi Carter, the campaign’s director.

“We would say, ‘how could that possibly be a democratic system with that kind of demographic mismatch?’”

Two factors perpetuate white male control over virtually every lever of US government: the huge advantage enjoyed by incumbents, and the Republican party’s continued focus on mostly white male candidates.

As the US barrels toward a minority-white population within a matter of decades, some believe elected officials will inevitably become more diverse. But that logic is flawed: women have always been half of the country, and they are still chronically underrepresented in government.

Meanwhile, politicians who currently hold office can make election laws and draw districts in their favour. This legislative cycle, Republican state lawmakers have devised a barrage of new voter restrictions that have targeted left-leaning communities, vulnerable voters and people of colour.

"""Don’t you dare"".

That was Kate Winslet's response when a director suggested possibly editing a sex scene in which she showed a “bulgy bit of belly” for her latest television series.

The actor claimed Craig Zobel, the director of her new HBO series Mare of Easttown, had offered to show her body in a more flattering light.

Winslet, who plays detective and a grandmother Mare Sheehan in a Pennsylvania town in the new programme, said she had refused - adding that she twice sent back the promotional poster for the drama because she felt it had been altered too much.

“I’m like: ‘Guys, I know how many lines I have by the side of my eye, please put them all back,’” Winslet, 45, told the New York Times.

The Academy Award winning actor added: “Listen, I hope that in playing Mare as a middle-aged woman – I will be 46 in October – I guess that’s why people have connected with this character in the way that they have done because there are clearly no filters.

“She’s a fully functioning, flawed woman with a body and a face that moves in a way that is synonymous with her age and her life and where she comes from. I think we’re starved of that a bit.”

"The Queen’s courtiers banned “coloured immigrants or foreigners” from serving in clerical roles in the royal household until at least the late 1960s, according to newly discovered documents that will reignite the debate over the British royal family and race.

Just a few months after Prince William said the royal family is ""very much not racist"", a Guardian exclusive reveals how Buckingham Palace negotiated controversial clauses – that remain in place to this day – exempting the Queen and her household from laws that prevent race and sex discrimination.

The papers were discovered at the National Archives as part of the Guardian’s ongoing investigation into the royal family’s use of an arcane parliamentary procedure, known as Queen’s consent, to secretly influence the content of British laws.

They reveal how in 1968, the Queen’s chief financial manager informed civil servants that “it was not, in fact, the practice to appoint coloured immigrants or foreigners” to clerical roles in the royal household, although they were permitted to work as domestic servants.

It is unclear when the practice ended. Buckingham Palace refused to answer questions about the ban and when it was revoked. It said its records showed people from ethnic minority backgrounds being employed in the 1990s. It added that before that decade, it did not keep records on the racial backgrounds of employees.

"Do you think this is the best system?

After months of deliberations, the World Health Organization has announced Covid-19 variants are to be named after letters of the Greek alphabet instead of their place of first discovery, which is ""stigmatising and discriminatory"".

The WHO has named four variants of concern, known to the public as the UK/Kent (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), Brazil (P.1) and India (B.1.617.2) variants. They will now be given the letters Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta respectively, to reflect their order of detection, with any new variants following the pattern down the Greek alphabet.

Historically, diseases have frequently been named after the locations they were thought to have developed, such as the Ebola virus, which takes its name from the Congolese river. However, such associations can be damaging for those places and are often inaccurate, as is the case with the “Spanish flu” of 1918, whose origins are unknown.

Earlier this month, the Indian government ordered social media platforms to take down content that referred to the “Indian variant”. The government order was cited as an example of its sensitivity to accusations that it had mishandled the latest outbreak.

Anti-Asian hate crime has risen as a result of the pandemic and associations between Covid and the site of its first outbreak in Wuhan, China. US anti-extremist groups said a rise in attacks on Asian-Americans was partly down to Donald Trump, who referred to Covid-19 as the “China virus”.

"New Zealand’s rare, highly endangered alpine parrots may have headed for the mountains to avoid people.

The kea - an alpine parrot - is thought to be the only parrot to live in the mountains, but scientists analysing DNA sequencing and fossil records have found the species were once present in other parts of the country.

The news is something of a knock to the kea’s internationally unique “alpine parrot” status. But it may also be a saving grace for the endangered bird, making it more capable of surviving habitat loss or increased competition.

Being an alpine specialist can make species like kea particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis. Research from Europe has found up to 22% of species studied on glaciers in the Italian Alps would disappear from the area once the glaciers had gone.

Associate professor Michael Knapp, one of the paper’s lead authors, said the idea that kea had moved specifically to avoid people was still speculative. But given kea were physically able to survive in a variety of habitats, it made sense to examine what the primary differences were.

"'An amazing decision'

The Australian environment minister has a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis, that's according to the country's federal court.

The judgment has been hailed by lawyers and teenagers, who brought the case, as a world first.

Eight teenagers and an octogenarian nun had sought an injunction to prevent the environment minister, Sussan Ley, approving a proposal to expand a coal mine in New South Wales, arguing she ​had a common law duty of care to protect younger people against future harm from climate change.

The judge, Justice Mordecai Bromberg, found the minister had a duty of care to not act in a way that would cause future harm to younger people. But he did not grant the injunction as he was not satisfied the minister would breach her duty of care.

David Barnden, a lawyer representing the children, said it was a historic and “amazing decision” with potentially significant consequences.

“The court has found that the minister owes a duty of care to younger children, to vulnerable people, and that duty says that the minister must not act in a way that causes harm – future harm – from climate change to younger people,” he said outside court. “It is the first time in the world that such a duty of care has been recognised, especially in a common law country.”

"The footprint per airship passenger would be about 4.5kg, compared to 53kg if that person was traveling via a jet plane. 

That's according to Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) who have developed a new environmentally friendly airship 84 years after the Hindenburg disaster.

The 100-passenger Airlander 10 airship can apparently take off and land from almost any flat surface and reached heights of 7,000ft (2,100m) and speeds of up to 50 knots (57mph) during its final tests.

HAV said it is in discussions with a number of airlines to operate a string of routes it will serve from 2025. These include Liverpool to Belfast, which would take five hours and 20 minutes; Oslo to Stockholm, in six and a half hours; and Seattle to Vancouver in just over four hours.

The journey by airship would take roughly the same time as aeroplane travel once getting to and from the airport was taken into account, but would generate a much smaller carbon footprint.

"Britain’s youngest MP, Nadia Whittome, has been told to take several weeks off work by her doctor after she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The Labour MP for Nottingham East, said she had been “battling some persistent health issues” for several months, and that while she had “been attempting to manage them” alongside her duties as a politician, it had recently “become clear that this is not feasible”.

Whittome, a former care worker and a hate-crime project worker, was elected in December 2019 aged 23 and became the Baby of the House.

In a statement explaining why she had disclosed the nature of her illness, she said: “I feel it is important for me to be honest that it is mental ill-health I am suffering from – specifically post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).""

"A @guardianaustralia investigation on endangered species has found that Scott Morrison's Coalition government tried to stop the publication of an academic paper that said it needed to drastically increase its spending to support threatened Australian wildlife.

Internal documents released to our team under freedom of information laws revealed that a briefing note prepared for a meeting with government-funded scientists suggested they ‘don’t publish the paper’, which was being drafted in 2019 and compared Australian funding to recover endangered wildlife with that in the US. 

Another option considered was publishing the paper, known as the Spending to Save paper, under a different set of author names – something that could have qualified as academic misconduct.

After our story was published online, the environment department said in a statement on Friday that: “We strongly reject any assertion that department officials sought to pressure researchers in relation to the non-publication or authorship of the paper.”

Don Driscoll, a professor at Deakin University who led a recent study that surveyed Australian scientists about pressures they face to change or not release their work, said the internal documents revealed a “disgraceful example of scientific suppression”.

“It’s really worrying because the public service is trying to hide important information about the state of our biodiversity from the public,” Driscoll, a professor at Deakin University, added. 

“The public needs to know why our biodiversity is under threat. They need to know it’s being enormously under-funded.”

Following an inquiry into the 1995 broadcast, the Duke of Cambridge said the programme had established a ""false narrative"" and that the ""deceitful way"" the interview was obtained had substantially influenced what his mother had said.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, also released a statement commenting on the outcome of the investigation saying: “Our mother was an incredible woman who dedicated her life to service. She was resilient, brave, and unquestionably honest. The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her life.”

"What a difference a day makes.

On Tuesday, the Texas governor Greg Abbott banned public schools and local governments from requiring people to wear masks, on the grounds that Texans should have the freedom to make their own health decisions.

The Covid death toll in Texas currently stands at 50,000, with the CDC still recommending masks to protect those who are yet to be vaccinated.

On Wednesday, Abbott then signed into law one of the strictest abortion bans in recent US history. If it comes into force in September, it would outlaw abortions after roughly six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest.

Although Abbott referred to the ban as saving ""children,"" a pregnancy is in fact an embryo at this stage, and cannot survive outside the womb for roughly another 18 weeks.

Pro-choice groups planning to fight the law have described it as clearly unconstitutional. Abortion is legal in all 50 US states, including Texas, because Roe v Wade - the landmark decision in the US Supreme Court - protects a woman's right to choose.

As many have pointed out, the restriction is effectively a total ban, as many women don't know they're pregnant until after six weeks, which means they would have virtually no choice under the new law to make their own health decisions.

"“Children are bearing the brunt of this escalation.”

In Gaza, a tiny coastal territory enclosed by walls and fences, there is no escape from the terrifying sound of explosions and the fear that any moment could be your last.

For children in their early teens, this is the fourth war they have lived through - and been traumatised by.

All those under the age of 13 have gone their whole life under an Israeli blockade, with restrictions on movement, naval warships patrolling the seas and military aircraft and surveillance drones in the skies above.

And in the now 11-day-old conflict between the Israel armed forces and militants in Gaza, at least 63 Palestinian children have been killed and hundreds injured, according to health officials inside the enclave.

In one incident, eight children from one extended family were killed as they were sleeping in an airstrike on the densely populated Shati refugee camp.

The Israeli military said it had targeted officials from Hamas, the Islamist faction that seized control of Gaza in 2007.

“The scale of violence is massive,” said Unicef, the UN children’s agency, at the weekend. “Children are bearing the brunt of this escalation.”

Young people in Israel are victims too. Two children have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza in the latest fighting, and over the years thousands have also been traumatised by air raid sirens, explosions and evacuations to bomb shelters.

A study conducted in Gaza by Unicef following the 2012 war found that 91% of children reported sleeping disturbances during the conflict; 94% said they slept with their parents; and 82% were either continuously or usually in fear of imminent death.

These children in Gaza have also spent their entire lives under the rule of a militant group. Hamas rockets often fall within its own borders, sometimes causing destruction, injuries and deaths. Its operations and infrastructure make civilians a target.

Hundreds of families have lost their homes altogether: what was once a place where children played, ate, did their homework and slept is now a pile of rubble and twisted metal.

Dog could now be used for mass coronavirus screening in crowded places, after a study concluded that they are better at detecting the virus in humans than many fast lateral flow tests.

The trial, conducted in March and April by France’s national veterinary school and the clinical research unit of Paris’s Necker-Cochin hospital, showed canines were able to detect the presence of the virus with 97% accuracy.

Researchers collected samples, cotton pads pressed for two minutes under participants’ armpits, from 335 people aged between six and 76 who presented themselves for a PCR test at testing centres in Paris.

The pads were then sealed in jars and given to at least two of the nine dogs used in the trial to be sniffed. The dogs’ handlers did not know in advance which samples were positive.

The dogs detected 97% of the 109 people whose PCR test subsequently proved positive, and 91% of those whose PCR test was negative.

A recent review of 64 studies found LFTs correctly identify on average 72% of people infected with the virus who have symptoms, and 58% who do not.

Prof Jean-Marc Tréluyer hailed the ""excellent results"" and the dogs' quick response. While they won't replace polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are significantly more reliable than LFT tests, they could ""help identify those people who should undergo a full viral test"" in places such as airports, train stations and concert venues.

"For nearly a century she was denied a voice by a culture of silence.

Finally, at the age of 107, Viola Fletcher got a national stage to bear witness to America’s deep history of racial violence.

Fletcher is the oldest living survivor of a massacre that took place in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on 31 May and 1 June 1921 when a white mob attacked the city’s “Black Wall Street”, killing an estimated 300 African Americans while robbing and burning more than 1,200 businesses, homes and churches.

She was just seven years old at the time.

For decades the atrocity was actively covered up and wished away. But Fletcher and her 100-year-old brother are seeking reparations and, ahead of the massacre’s centenary, yesterday they appeared before a House of Representatives judiciary subcommittee considering legal remedies.

“I am here seeking justice,” Fletcher said.

She recalled how the Greenwood neighbourhood of Tulsa had once been a thriving and affluent African American community, but that this bright future was suddenly taken away. 

“I will never forget the violence of the white mob when we left our home. I still see Black men being shot, Black bodies lying in the street. I still smell smoke and see fire ... I have lived through the massacre every day.”

The hearing was told that there has never been any direct compensation from the city or state for massacre survivors or their descendants, and that racial disparities, compounded by gentrification and urban planning, persist in Tulsa today – a microcosm of America.

Fletcher also asked that the country acknowledge her experience and give the survivors a chance to seek justice. “I believe we must acknowledge America’s sins,” she said. “It is the least we can do.”

The analysis, which is yet to be peer reviewed, was based on a survey involving 812 people - mostly white, female participants - with long Covid in the UK and internationally, who were contacted via social media.

Scores across 14 common long-Covid symptoms were compared before and after the first vaccine dose. Data showed that 56.7% of respondents experienced an overall improvement in symptoms, with 24.6% remaining unchanged and 18.7% reporting a deterioration in their symptoms.

In general, those who received mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) reported more improvements in symptoms, compared with those who got an adenovirus vaccine (Oxford/AstraZeneca).

In particular, those who received the Moderna vaccine were more likely to see improvements in symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog and muscle pain, and less likely to report a deterioration, the analysis found.

Long Covid, or post-Covid syndrome, describes a range of symptoms that persist for more than four weeks after a first suspected infection with the virus, and which are not explained by other causes.

There has been no sign of even a temporary truce to allow medics to recover people – alive and dead – from under collapsed buildings.

Eight days of Israeli airstrikes and Hamas rocket barrages have killed more than 200 people, the vast majority of them Palestinian.

Tensions exploded last week after Israeli police wounded hundreds of Palestinians during protests, and officers in riot gear stormed al-Aqsa mosque – the third holiest site in Islam.

Hamas, the Islamist group that rules inside the strip, then began firing rockets toward Jerusalem, triggering the Israeli assault on Gaza.

Israel says its strikes target militants. Hamas has stationed its fighters in and fired rockets from civilian areas. Twelve people in Israel, including two children, have been killed by militants, who have launched more than 3,000 rockets during the past week.

"A group of scientists have concluded that sharks possess an internal navigation system similar to GPS that allows them to use Earth’s magnetic forces to travel long distances with accuracy.

Researchers from Florida State University made the discovery by subjecting 20 bonnethead sharks, part of the hammerhead family, to “magnetic displacement” exercises that replicated geographical locations hundreds of miles from where they were captured.

When the sharks were exposed to magnetic cues emulating a site about 375 miles south of where they were captured, they turned to swim north, exhibiting a “homeward orientation” suggesting the use of magnetic forces in their navigation, said Bryan Keller, the lead author of the study.

The research helps explain why sharks can travel across vast oceans but return to exactly the same location annually to feed, breed and give birth, Keller said. He and his team believe the bonnetheads’ “onboard” navigation system is probably common to other species of sharks because it is unlikely bonnetheads evolved with sensitivity to magnetic forces while others that also travel long distances did not.

According to Science Magazine, in 2005 a great white shark was tracked swimming from South Africa to Australia and back again in almost a straight line, leading scientists to believe sharks have a magnetic sense to steer themselves similar to those found in sea birds, lobsters and turtles.

Until now, however, little research has been conducted.

"The fighting between Israel and militant groups in Gaza ""has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis"", the UN secretary general has said.

António Guterres' warning came as Israeli warplanes launched what appeared to be the heaviest airstrikes yet on Gaza City.

The series of attacks early on Monday rocked the city from north to south for 10 minutes and was more intense, covered a broader area and lasted longer than the raids 24 hours earlier in which 42 Palestinians were killed – the deadliest single attack in the latest violence between Israel and the Hamas militant group that rules Gaza.

The Israeli army spokesperson’s office said the strikes targeted Hamas’s “underground military infrastructure”.

"Who owns Australia?

The true answer is First Nations peoples, whose ownership stems back 60,000 years. The legal answer is more complex.

Six months ago @GuardianAustralia set out to learn who owns the outback. The data we received was unwieldy, incomplete, inconsistent and often came with a hefty price tag.

The concept of land ownership in Australia is complicated. There are freehold titles, as well as exclusive and non-exclusive native titles. They all relate to the rights of the people who own the land.

The maps above show changes in Indigenous-held land over the years.

Since 1965, Indigenous 'ownership' has returned to parts of the country - after two centuries of violent dispossession through European colonisation.

For mapping purposes, we've defined Indigenous tenure as exclusive-possession native title and freehold, as they give the right to exclude others from the land.

Using this definition, Indigenous tenure makes up about 26% of Australia's landmass.

But for Indigenous leaders like Keven Smith, a Torres Strait man and chief executive of Queensland South Native Title Services, the connection of traditional owners to a place is not defined by whether they are able to be granted native title.

“If you ask the question of who owns Australia, I would say that First Nations people own this country,” Smith says. “Even though there’s limited application of native title over the four corners of this nation, cultural heritage is tenure-blind.”

"Members of the US Congress have responded as the deadly hostilities in Israel and Gaza entered a fifth day with no sign of abating.

Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian-American congresswoman who has been critical of Israeli policy towards the Palestinians, questioned the US government's 'unconditional support' of Israel and, often tearing up as she spoke, accused Israel of being an 'apartheid state'.

Earlier on Thursday, Joe Biden said there had 'not been a significant overreaction' by Israel to the Hamas rocket attacks and Ted Deutch and Debbie Wasserman Schultz spoke in the House in support of Israel’s 'right to defend her citizens'.

Meanwhile Ilhan Omar said: 'Instead of condemning blatant crimes against humanity and human rights abuses, many members of Congress have instead fallen back on a blanket statement defending Israel's airstrikes against civilians under the guise of self-defence.'

"These are the words of an Ethiopian nun, offering a rare first-person account of the widespread horror she sees on a daily basis inside the heavily isolated region of Tigray.

According to her and many eyewitnesses, thousands of women and girls are being targeted by the deliberate tactic of using rape as a weapon in the civil war that has erupted in the country.

“Rape is starting at the age of 8 and to the age of 72. Many, many have been raped. This has all happened so quickly,” said the sister, who is based in the regional capital of Mekelle, but cannot be named to protect her security.

“It is so widespread, I go on seeing it everywhere, thousands. This rape is in public, in front of family, husbands, in front of everyone. Their legs and their hands are cut, all in the same way.”

The northern area of Ethiopia, home to 5.6 million people, has been racked by civil war since the Nobel peace prize laureate, the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, sent the army in to oust the powerful regional government there on 4 November.

The nun told the Guardian: “I would like to say to the world: they must not wait for another second. Everybody in the world must act, must condemn this.”

Muslims in countries like the US and UK have been able to gather en masse for the first time in over a year and celebrate the end of Ramadan - but given uneven distribution of Covid-19 vaccines many others around the world have not been able to meet.

"""This is mine. I own it.""

As she starts to rebuild her life after surgery, the artist Tracey Emin has shared unflinching self-portraits taken during her cancer treatment.

‘I’m smiling and talking to you,” Emin told the Guardian's Jonathan Jones, sitting at her kitchen table. “But it’s not always like this.”

In 2020, Emin was diagnosed with bladder cancer - and in April this year she announced that she had reached a “big, big milestone” when her three-monthly scans were “all clear”.

But it has cost her dearly: in order to remove a large tumour - during a surgery that lasted six hours - 12 doctors had to cut out her uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, lymph nodes, part of her colon, urethra and some of her vagina.

Emin now has a urostomy bag, which replaces the bladder and urinary system and needs to be emptied as frequently as every 20 minutes.

“Now I’ve got a terrible pain in my legs, it’s unbearable. That’s why I’ve been in bed. I’m determined to go for a walk later because I hardly ever go out. I have a urostomy bag, so I have a major disability. The more well I get, the more annoying it is. Previously it was all right because I was on morphine. But now I want to do things and I can’t.”

Emin has spoken about her illness and gradual recovery with an honesty that has shown people who may have thought of her just as a loudmouth celebrity artist exactly how sensitive and courageous a soul she is.

"Campaigners have hailed a victory for Glaswegian solidarity and told the Home Office “you messed with the wrong city” as two men detained by UK Immigration Enforcement were released back into their community after a day of protest.

Police Scotland intervened to free the men after a tense day-long standoff between immigration officials and hundreds of local residents, who surrounded their van in a residential street on the southside of Glasgow to stop the detention of the men during Eid al-Fitr.

Staff from Immigration Enforcement are believed to have swooped on a property in Pollokshields early on Thursday morning and detained people.

By mid-morning, a crowd of about 200 protesters surrounded the vehicle, preventing it from driving away, and chanting ""Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here!"", with one protester lying under the van to prevent it driving off.

Some people say they feel like they can finally speak their minds, while others believe the unrest, which was sparked by now cancelled tax reform proposals, has gone too far during the country's third Covid wave.

At least 47 people have died and local and international human rights organisations have blamed police for the killings. Dozens of disciplinary investigations have been launched, and three officers have been charged with murder.

The action has led to president Iván Duque now promising a national dialogue over issues raised by young demonstrators, including free university tuition.

"Animals have the ability to be aware of feelings and sensations - and in a victory for animal welfare campaigners - for the first time in UK law that's being formally acknowledged.

As well as formally being recognised as sentient beings, the government is setting out a number of animal welfare measures including halting most live animal exports and banning the import of hunting trophies.

The reforms will be introduced through a series of bills, including an animal sentience bill, and will cover farm animals and pets in the UK, and include protections for animals abroad, through bans on ivory and shark fins, and a potential ban on foie gras.

The action plan for animal welfare includes measures that will involve cracking down on pet theft. Controversial e-collars that deliver an electric shock to train pets will be banned, and import rules changed to try to stop puppy smuggling.

Some of the measures, including microchipping cats and stopping people keeping primates as pets, have been several years in preparation, while others, like the restriction of live animal exports, have been the subject of decades-long campaigns.

"The Covid pandemic was a preventable disaster that need not have cost millions of lives if the world had reacted more quickly, according to a WHO-commissioned report.

The independent high-level panel behind the work have slammed global leaders and called for major changes to ensure something like this cannot happen again.

The report of the panel, chaired by Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, former president of Liberia, found “weak links at every point in the chain”.

It said preparation was inconsistent and underfunded, the alert system too slow and too meek while the World Health Organization was under-powered. It concluded that the response has exacerbated inequalities. “Global political leadership was absent,” the report said.

Clark described February 2020 as “a month of lost opportunity to avert a pandemic, as so many countries chose to wait and see”.

“For some, it wasn’t until hospital ICU beds began to fill that more action was taken,” she said. “And by then it was too late to avert the pandemic impact. What followed then was a winner takes all scramble for PPE and therapeutics. Globally, health workers were tested to their limits and the rates of infection, illness and death soared and continue to soar.”

According to the Covid-19 dashboard, run by Johns Hopkins University, there have been more than 160 million cases of the disease since the pandemic began last year with the official death toll reaching 3,319,169 today.",2021-05-12 21:00:34
"Māori party co-leader Rawiri Waititi has been thrown out of New Zealand’s parliament after denouncing rhetoric from the opposition as racist and performing a haka.

Waititi said the opposition was inciting racism across the country through its stance on Māori healthcare - and told lawmakers in the chamber that he was forced to listen to ""a constant barrage of insults"" directed towards indigenous people.

When asked to sit down by the speaker, Trevor Mallard, Waititi instead stepped into the centre of parliament to perform a haka, and was subsequently thrown out - and accompanied by his party's co-leader, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer.

The haka is a ceremonial dance for Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, and can represent a challenge, and is sometimes performed in moments of conflict.

This incident comes after weeks of escalating debate, in which the opposition National party has accused the government of a “separatist agenda” and creating “two systems by stealth”. Their arguments began after the government announced expanded, independent health services for Māori, who typically have far worse health outcomes than other ethnic groups.

In February, Waititi was ejected from the House for not wearing a tie. He said he had chosen to wear cultural dress in defiance of dress code: Waititi has dubbed ties a “colonial noose” and wore a pounamu, or greenstone, necklace in place of a necktie. House rules were subsequently revised to remove the necktie requirement.

Addressing the 2,500 key workers given tickets to the show, she said: “It’s very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them.""

Each year this century, at least half of the winners in the mixed-gender categories have been men, but in 2021, six out of seven are women.

Little Mix became the first all-female band to win the British group award, with Five Star in 1987, Stereo MCs in 1994 and Gorillaz in 2018 the only previous category winners to feature women.

Leigh-Anne Pinnock said on receiving the award: “It’s not easy being a female in the UK pop industry. We’ve seen the white male dominance, misogyny, sexism and lack of diversity. We’re proud of how we’ve stuck together, stood our ground, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever.”

Los Angeles trio Haim won international group, the first all-female group to do so in nearly two decades following Destiny’s Child’s win in 2002. Billie Eilish won international female, Arlo Parks won breakthrough artist and pop singer Griff won the rising star award.

Taylor Swift became the first woman to receive the global icon award, previously won by David Bowie, Elton John and Robbie Williams. “There is no career path that comes free of negativity,” she said on receiving the award in person. “If you’re met with resistance that probably means that you’re doing something new.”

"Hundreds of Palestinian protesters have been wounded in clashes with Israeli police and more than 20 are dead in Gaza.

The protesters have complained of oppressive restrictions during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The injuries took place during near-nightly protests that ramped up over the weekend and spread to other areas of Israel and the occupied West Bank.

The situation was further inflamed by a now-postponed Israeli court ruling on whether authorities can evict dozens of Palestinians from a majority-Arab Jerusalem neighbourhood, and give their homes to Jewish settlers.

As protests intensified, militant groups in Gaza were accused of launching more than 200 rockets into Israel before Israel responded with all-night airstrikes on the Palestinian coastal territory which killed twenty-four people.

"Monzo, the online bank, has become one of the first UK companies to offer paid leave for employees who are affected by the loss of a pregnancy.

The bank’s policy will give either partner up to 10 extra days of paid leave if they lose a baby due to abortion, miscarriage or stillbirth, regardless of when in the pregnancy it happens.

“This also includes colleagues who are partners or surrogate mothers, recognising that pregnancy loss doesn’t just affect women or heterosexual couples,” the bank said. Extra leave can be approved by managers if staff feel they need more than two weeks.

Under UK employment law, businesses only have to allow parents to use planned maternity or paternity leave if they lose their baby after 24 weeks, when it is considered a stillbirth.

Any loss before that is counted as a miscarriage and does not qualify them for maternity leave or pay. It is then up to the discretion of employers whether to offer compassionate leave, annual leave or unpaid holiday.

In the UK, more than one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage, resulting in roughly 250,000 losses each year, according to the Miscarriage Association. Most occur in the first three months of pregnancy.",2021-05-10 19:00:44

"'It could be a gamechanger'.

Uganda has announced a new project using drones to deliver HIV medicines to its most remote areas.

The first drone took off last week, carrying medicines out to 78 community groups and health facilities across the widely scattered Ssese islands, which have the highest HIV prevalence in the country.

The delivery of antiretroviral drugs and healthcare is difficult, weather-dependent and risky for healthcare workers, as travel into the region - 60 miles from the capital, Kampala - is possible only by boat.

The Uganda Medical Association has welcomed the drones, but expressed concern over drug shortages due to inadequate funding. Its secretary general Mukuzi Muhereza said: “We are welcoming it. It’s very important and it could be a gamechanger. It would be nice to see whether it really works with our bad network and connectivity.

“Realistically I think we are not giving enough money to national medical stores to purchase drugs and supplies for every Ugandan that needs it. The biggest change would be if we can enhance the budget and make sure we have what [we need] to send.”

"What are your thoughts on these new immigration rules?

Oscar winners, Nobel prize recipients and Brit award-winners are just some of the foreign nationals who will be fast-tracked for UK visas under a tweak to immigration rules announced by the Home Office.

An existing 'global talent' route was introduced in 2020 which supplies visas for leader or potential leaders in academia, arts and culture, or digital technology. This tweak streamlines the route for people who have won prestigious prizes.

This is part of Home Secretary Priti Patel's Australian-style points system - a move which closes the door to low-skilled workers including those in hospitality, care, and agriculture.

""This is exactly what our new point-based immigration system was designed for – attracting the best and brightest based on the skills and talent they have, not where they’ve come from,"" Patel said.

The awards cover science, technology, maths, engineering, music, film, acting, and literature. However the rules cover very specific categories within these award. It is only an Oscar in a leading acting or directorial role which will be favoured, and with literature, only the Nobel prize is accepted.

For music, possible routes include a best international male or female award at the Brits, best international act at the Mobo awards, or a Grammy for lifetime achievement.

Their peaceful protest - now known as the Peterloo Massacre (pictured above) - turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered a private militia paid for by rich locals to storm the crowd with sabres. An estimated 18 people died and more than 650 were injured in the chaos.

"In helmet and bulletproof vest, Abir Moussi took her seat in Tunisia's parliament - prompting amusement, eye rolls and memes - but why?

The MP and lawyer made the attention-grabbing gesture after the speaker banned private security guards from all parties, some of whom have been accused of assault.

Moussi is a supporter of the autocratic former president Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who was ousted in Tunisia’s 2011 uprising. She was sitting with a picture of Ali’s predecessor, Habib Bourguiba, which provoked laughter and resignation among Tunisians, who are wearied by the seemingly endless fighting between the parliament’s religious and secular blocs and increasingly concerned by rising cases of Covid-19 and mounting national debt.

Moussi, a senior member of the secular Free Destourian party, known by its French acronym PDL, defended the old regime in court after the revolution, which initially led to her being ostracised by her fellow party members and attacked in the street. But she has enjoyed an unlikely rise in popularity after a growing dissatisfaction with the democratic transition.

Tunisia has been plagued by sinking wages, growing joblessness and worsening public services. Several recent polls have confirmed that both PDL and Moussi’s own populist, conspiracy theory-laden platform are popular among voters.

Moussi’s personal rankings are second only to president Kais Saied, who secured an overwhelming majority in elections in 2019 after running as an independent on a socially conservative platform.",2021-05-05 15:04:15

"No, they're not really that small 🧐 ...

This photo of Joe and Jill Biden visiting former president Jimmy Carter and former first lady Rosalynn in Georgia has been doing the rounds on social media.

It makes the Bidens look three times the size of the Carters and even the lounge chairs look like they are from a doll's house.

But it's not what it seems.

@guardianaustralia's picture editor, Carly Earl, explains that the image is possibly distorted by using a wide-angle lens, used in smaller spaces where the photographer doesn't have room to move far enough to get everyone in the frame.

But using a very wide lens while also standing very close to the subjects will distort the photo, making those close to the camera appear giant while shrinking those further away.

You don’t need special gear to create this optical trickery. If you have an iPhone 11 or 12 you actually can use the wide-angle setting in the camera on the phone to capture a wider field of view.

Just ask whatever former president you encounter to step back slightly, then get yourself in front, and snap.

The company brought in a record £38 billion (€44bn) from sales in Europe last year but did not have to pay any corporation tax to the Grand Duchy on the profits it made.

𝗦𝗼 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗶𝘁 𝗯𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝗼 𝗺𝘂𝗰𝗵 𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲, 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗽𝗮𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝘁𝗮𝘅?

Accounts for Amazon EU Sarl - which it sells products to hundreds of millions of households in the UK and across Europe - show that the Luxembourg unit made a €1.2bn loss and therefore paid no tax. They employ just 5,262 staff there meaning that the income per person amounts to €8.4m.

Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation said: ""These figures are mind-blowing, even for Amazon ... The bulk of Amazon’s UK income is booked offshore, in the enormously loss-making Luxembourg subsidiary, which means that not only are they not making a meaningful tax contribution now, but are unlikely to do so for years to come given the enormous carried forward losses they have now built up.”

An Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon pays all the taxes required in every country where we operate. Corporate tax is based on profits, not revenues, and our profits have remained low given our heavy investments and the fact that retail is a highly competitive, low margin business.""

But Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP has said: “It seems that Amazon’s relentless campaign of appalling tax avoidance continues ... [their] revenues have soared under the pandemic while our high streets struggle.""

Last month, Joe Biden tabled plans for a minimum corporation tax rate, which would force large technology companies and corporations to pay taxes to national governments based on the sales they generate in each country, irrespective of where they are based. Germany and France have backed the plans but the UK has thus far remained silent.

Amazon owner Jeff Bezos - the world’s richest person - welcomed Biden’s proposals and said the company was “supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate”.

Until now that is ... A new legal change has come into force meaning marriage certificates in England and Wales will now include the names of both parents of the couple getting hitched, instead of only that of the father or stepfather of each of the parties.

The government previously resisted the change on cost grounds, but this is now part of the introduction of a new digital system to modernise, simplify and speed up the process by which marriages are registered, helping to tackle a backlog.

"Seizing on Donald Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election, Republicans have launched a brazen attack on voting this year. It's part of an effort to entrench control over a rapidly changing electorate by changing the rules of democracy. 

As of mid-February, 253 bills were pending to restrict voting in 43 states. Many of those restrictions take direct aim at mail-in and early voting, the very policies that led to November’s record turnout.

Just this Thursday, Florida's legislature passed a bill that includes restrictions on drop boxes and voting by mail, which Democrats and voting rights activists say amounts to voter suppression. The bill, which closely mirrors similar Republican ploys in Georgia and Michigan, is expected to particularly impact minority communities.

"By nature, glaciers go through phases of advance and retreat. But lately these immense bodies of ice – so vast and ancient as to have carved the surface of the Earth – have been losing ground in a warming world.

At the Franz Josef Glacier in the Southern Alps of New Zealand the difference could hardly be more stark.

The pictures above show how much has changed between 1871 to 2016, but even a visitor returning to the glacier this year, after 10 years, would be able to notice the huge loss. Since 2008, it has been retreating rapidly and lost a massive 1.56km in length, at the fastest rate ever recorded.

Over 40 years, annual aerial surveys of the Southern Alps in New Zealand have shown the altitude at which snow persists throughout the year is climbing higher, and the overall volume of ice reducing – with flow-on effects for the glaciers.

More recent surveys have been even more sobering. The summer of 2017-2018, which saw January temperatures of nearly 3C warmer than average, was the worst on record. Some glaciers had shrunk so much, they were hard to see; many would be gone within decades.

The outlook is similarly grim for glaciers the world over, with human-induced climate warming the chief factor in their decline.

"When life gives you memes ...

Zoë Roth, the woman whose picture was central to the 2005 Disaster Girl meme, has sold the original photo for $473,000 – the latest addition to the cryptocurrency-linked, digital image NFT craze that is sweeping through the art market.

The image was taken of Roth, then aged four, by her father in front of a burning house in Mebane, North Carolina. Firefighters had intentionally set the blaze as a controlled fire.

Roth, now aged 21 and a university student, sold the image through Ben Lashes, an NFT, or non-fungible token, entrepreneur who has racked up about $2m in sales for sales including Nyan Cat, Grumpy Cat, Keyboard Cat, Doge, Success Kid and David After Dentist.

Roth, who says she plans to use the proceeds to pay off her student loans and donate additional money to charity, told the New York Times: “The internet is big. Whether you’re having a good experience or a bad experience, you kind of just have to make the most of it.”

She told the Raleigh News & Observer: “Nobody who is a meme tried to do that, it just ended up that way. Is it luck? Is it fate? I have no idea. But I will take it.”

"Tiny hummingbirds like this one have succeeded where many activists and protesters have fallen short - they have forced the construction of a controversial pipeline in western Canada to be halted.

Campaigners have tried fruitlessly for years to stop the multibillion-dollar project, but after the discovery of an Anna’s hummingbird nest in a tree felled during the works, construction was ordered to stop for the next four months.

The migratory bird is not endangered, but it is protected under federal law, and community groups in southern British Columbia had raised the alarm that TransMountain was chopping down trees in vulnerable nesting areas.

In a statement, the company said it tries to clear trees outside of critical nesting seasons, but admitted “this is not always feasible”.

Marred by cost overruns in recent months, the TransMountain project, which was purchased by Justin Trudeau’s government in 2018, will nearly triple capacity of the existing pipeline, moving 890,000 barrels of crude oil each day to the Pacific Ocean when complete.

Sixty women began training at Camp Pendleton in California in January. Despite seven dropping out because of injury, the remaining 53 went on graduate.

"What do you think it takes to be a good spy?

The British agency GCHQ has said apprentices on their scheme are four times more likely to have dyslexia than those on other organisations’ programmes - the result of a drive to recruit those whose brains process information differently.

GCHQ says those with dyslexia have valuable skills spotting patterns that others miss – a key area the spy agency wants to encourage as it pivots away from dead letter drops and bugging towards high-tech cybersecurity and data analysis.

“We’re looking for people who can see something that’s out of place in a bigger picture, who have good visual awareness and can spot anomalies,” said Jo Cavan, the director of strategy, policy and engagement at GCHQ.

“If they’re sifting through large amounts of data from a large number of sources to prevent a terrorist attack or a serious organised criminal, skills such as pattern recognition are key. A lot of dyslexic colleagues have those strengths.”

Cavan said that the agency has valued neurodiversity during its 100-year existence, with the second world war code-breaker Alan Turing its best known employee with dyslexia.

However, the shift to online defence and security prompted by the government’s integrated review in March will make dyslexic thinking skills an even bigger feature of GCHQ’s future, she said.

A report produced by the charity, Made by Dyslexia, with the consultancy EY suggested that some of the thinking skills people with dyslexia tend to be especially strong in include complex problem-solving, empathy, communication and critical thinking.

These are becoming increasingly valued in workplaces as AI and machine-learning mean that more routine tasks are automated, the authors said.",2021-04-30 21:00:08
"Twenty women have come forward to accuse actor-producer-director Noel Clarke of groping, harassment and bullying, the Guardian can reveal.

Clarke, who first became famous for his Kidulthood series of films, strongly denies the accusations, which were made shortly after Bafta announced that it planned to give Clarke a special award for outstanding British contribution to cinema.

Our reporters spoke to 20 women, all of whom knew Clarke in a professional capacity. They variously accuse him of sexual harassment, unwanted touching or groping, sexually inappropriate behaviour and bullying between 2004 and 2019.

The alleged misconduct also includes claims he secretly filmed a naked audition and allegedly showed colleagues sexually explicit photos and videos of women.

Clarke said in a statement: “In a 20-year career, I have put inclusivity and diversity at the forefront of my work and never had a complaint made against me. If anyone who has worked with me has ever felt uncomfortable or disrespected, I sincerely apologise. I vehemently deny any sexual misconduct or wrongdoing and intend to defend myself against these false allegations.”

Through his lawyers, Clarke categorically denied every allegation that the Guardian put to him, bar one, accepting he once made inappropriate comments about one woman, for which he later apologised, but denying the rest of her complaints.

In a 29-page letter, his lawyers said he categorically denies all of the other allegations, from all 20 women, in some cases questioning their credibility. They deny their client is a serial sexual predator.

Since publishing our investigation, the British Academy Film Awards has suspended Clarke's outstanding contribution award and membership, while ITV has cancelled plans to show the final episode of his primetime big-budget thriller Viewpoint.

"The UK is being taken to court by three young people who claim their human rights are being breached by the government’s failure to act decisively on the climate crisis.

Adetola Stephanie Onamade, Marina Tricks and Jerry Amokwandoh, all students in their early 20s, will tomorrow ask for a judicial review of government actions to cut national carbon emissions.

The three claimants say that despite enshrining a net zero goal by 2050 in law and parliament declaring a climate emergency, the government does not have an adequate roadmap to match the scale of the crisis.

Frustrated at the pace of action, they will argue that the UK has disregarded their rights to life, family life and not be discriminated against, which are protected under articles 2, 8 and 14 of the Human Rights Act.

Mexican-born Tricks, the youngest claimant aged 20, said she felt she had a duty to hold her government accountable. She told the Guardian: “We’re in the epicentre of destruction. It’s almost about weaponising the privileges we have of being in the global north.”

The other two young claimants are also from diaspora backgrounds: Onamade from Nigeria and Trinidad and Tobago and Amokwandoh from Ghana. They say they are also eager to highlight links between the climate crisis and wider social injustice, be it gender, race or wealth, pointing out that environmental harm is not shared equally.

In the UK, illegal levels of air pollution disproportionately affect racially marginalised communities, while the country is exporting its plastic pollution problem to poorer countries rather than tackling it domestically.

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which has lead responsibility for climate change, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

But in its response to a pre-legal action letter, the government’s legal team called the claim “pointless” given that the government had published plans to meet its net zero target and was due to publish a net zero strategy before the Cop26 climate talks in November.

"In one of Pakistan's most impoverished provinces, an unusual mobile library service is offering students an education lifeline where schools have closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Every Friday, Roshan the camel visits the small town of Mand in the Balochistan province, with his saddle panniers full of books.

Roshan visits four villages, staying in each at the home of a “mobiliser”, where all the district children aged four to 16 can come to read, borrow and exchange books with one another.

Blighted by a separatist insurgency for the past two decades, Balochistan has a 24% female literacy rate, one of the lowest in the world, compared with a male literacy rate of 56%. It also has the highest percentage of children out of school in the country.

When Covid closed the schools across the province, two women in Mand, Zubaida Jalal, a federal minister in the Pakistan government, and her sister Rahima Jalal, headteacher of a local high school, came up with the idea of involving a camel to help their cause.

The Jalal sisters say there has been a lot of interest in the scheme from other areas, and they have just started a similar library service in the city district of Gwadar, Balochistan, with a camel called Chirag.

Chirag visits five towns each week accompanied by his handler and Ismail Yaqoob, a volunteer and teacher. Yaqoob says the children are often waiting for them to arrive in the village; "" Children are so interested in reading and in their studies, but sadly the state does not invest in education.”

"The world of English sport is uniting for an unprecedented four-day boycott of social media to protest against continued abuse and racism aimed at players, managers, pundits and countless others.

Watford captain Troy Deeney has spoken openly of the racist abuse both he and his family are consistently subjected to. He told BBC Breakfast he hopes the action, which starts this afternoon, puts pressure on social media giants to do more to eradicate online hate.

The boycott, first announced by the leading English football organisations, begins at 3pm today until 11.59pm on Monday. Other sporting bodies have joined the action including Uefa, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Professional Cricketers’ Association, Premiership Rugby and the Lawn Tennis Association. Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton has given his backing to the campaign too - and @guardian_sport is also taking part, by pausing posts from Guardian Sport's Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts.

The campaign is calling for fresh measures to tackle racism, sexism and discrimination – including a requirement for social media companies to display a warning if a user writes an abusive message, and to ask them to enter personal data if they wish to send it. They also want social media companies to have to submit a detailed quarterly report, outlining efforts they have made to prevent abuse, so they can be held more accountable.

Will Woodward, head of sport at Guardian News & Media, said: “We generally aren’t in favour of boycotts or blackouts and believe news and robust comment are essential. But the relentless abuse must stop. It’s important to take a stand.”

Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, also gave his unequivocal backing to the initiative, saying: “Allowing a culture of hatred to grow with impunity is dangerous, very dangerous, not only for football but for society as a whole. We’ve had enough of these cowards who hide behind their anonymity to spew out their noxious ideologies.”

A new report has suggested that the rate of ice loss roughly doubles every 10 years - and scientists are saying that the rapid disappearance of mountain glaciers – separate from the Greenland and Antarctic ice shields – is one of the most dramatic signs of global heating.

The White House’s chief medical adviser said that countries inability to unite and deliver an adequate global response to Covid-19 has caused it to overwhelm many countries - and he singled out wealthier nations for failing to provide equitable access to healthcare around the world.

"Justin Bieber has been accused of cultural appropriation, and being a “dilettante … dipping his toe in the culture”, after changing his hairstyle.

As in 2016, when he was pictured in cornrows, the images the Canadian singer posted this weekend of his new locs style prompted outrage.

Stephanie Cohen, co-founder and legal and political organiser at the Halo Collective, a natural hair organisation, said Bieber had “no right” to wear the hairstyle.

“My reasoning and understanding of someone wearing something not specific to their culture or ethnicity is that if they cannot speak for black or minority rights [and] be a consistent ally – then they have no right to wear something like locs.”

Irene Shelley, editor of Black Beauty and Hair magazine, said: “I think why people are annoyed with Justin Bieber casually wearing locs is that it’s seen as not respecting the origins of the style.

Both Cohen and Shelley also explained that the common name for the hairstyle, “dreadlocks”, was rooted in a history of racism.

Cohen said the name “comes from the negative term ‘dreadful’ – coined by slave owners and colonisers to describe the hairstyle"", and that the term has been so normalised in the English language that people often are ignorant towards its connotations.

Shelley said “loc wearers will sometimes take offence at their locs being called dreadlocks as they see a difference: one is a hairstyle and the other is a lifestyle.”

She was released from house arrest last month at the end of a five-year sentence for spying charges that she denies, but immediately ordered back into court to face the new propaganda charges.

Kermani said he would appeal the new sentence within 21 days under Iranian law.

Her family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charges.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe spent nearly four years in two different prisons and spent nine months in solitary confinement, a regular feature of Iranian interrogation techniques in cases of what they describe as security prisoners. She was released into house arrest in March 2020 after the coronavirus outbreak.",2021-04-26 15:23:48

"A moving documentary about Colette, a former resistance fighter, who travelled to visit the concentration camp where her brother died has won an Oscar.

Colette Marin-Catherine, one of the last surviving members of the French Resistance, always refused to set foot in Germany but this changed when a young history student named Lucie entered her life. Together they travel to what remains of the forced labour camp near Nordhausen, Germany, in a journey of discovery that reopens old wounds and lessons of the past.

The film, which you can watch in full via the link in our bio, was released by the Guardian and directed by Anthony Giacchino.

Speaking on stage at the Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night producer Alice Doyard said: “This award is a tribute to women of any ages who are joining hands and fighting for justice.”

“I stand here, as Jamika and I break this glass ceiling, with so much excitement for the future,” said Neal in accepting the award, along with their fellow stylist Sergio Lopez-Rivera.

Neal, the department head, and Wilson, Viola Davis’s personal hair stylist, won for their work on the film about one of the few openly lesbian, black performers in America in the 1920s.

Neal, left in the picture above, designed Oprah Winfrey’s wigs for 2017’s The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. As reported by Vogue, she created 100 wigs for Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom in less than three weeks, based on the fewer than 10 photographs that exist of the legendary “mother of blues"".

“I know that one day it won’t be unusual or groundbreaking, it will just be normal” for black women, trans women, and Latinas to be claiming Oscars, Neal said.

Zhao, 39, consolidated her domination of the category this awards season, by being named best director for Nomadland, her acclaimed road movie starring Frances McDormand.

"Caster Semenya should be angry, but she isn’t. As the clock ticks down towards the Tokyo Olympics, the South African should, like her rivals, be training for the push to land a third consecutive gold medal.

Instead, the 30-year-old, who has fought a wave of prejudice and stigma throughout her life, is forlornly waiting on news from the European court of human rights (ECHR), which, in turn, could convince World Athletics that being asked to take medication is perhaps not the most humane way of dealing with a woman who has a congenital condition some believe hands her an unfair advantage.

@castersemenya800m's “crime” – apart from dominating on the track – is that she is an athlete with differences in sex development, a condition that leads to elevated levels of testosterone in the body. This led athletics’ governing body to create a ruling in 2018, following her rapid rise to fame, which forbids women with a similar condition to compete internationally between 400m and mile-long races, unless medication – one option is to take a daily oral contraceptive pill – is taken.

"Hospitals in parts of India are using social media to beg for help finding oxygen and key equipment as the country’s second coronavirus wave continues to build, breaking global records.

This week the number of recorded cases started to grow faster than in any other country, passing 300,000 a day, along with more than 2,000 deaths - that's close to twice the daily deaths India experienced during the first peak of the virus between July and September 2020.

The real death toll from the virus in the world's second most populous nation is thought to be significantly higher than official figures, amid reports of some state governments fudging data, and crematorium equipment in some states melting due to the constant heat of fires burning day and night.

Oxygen, and the lack of it, has been the focus of significant alarm in recent days. Government administrators, hospitals and ordinary citizens are using Twitter and WhatsApp to try to find canisters of oxygen, alongside beds in intensive-care units and drugs such as remdesivir or ivermectin. Neither is proven to help with the virus, but people are desperate.

Experts speculate that highly infectious variants may be playing a role but say their impact was strongly exacerbated by the resumption of normal life - adding that victory against the virus was declared too quickly after six successive months of falling caseloads.

India has been administering about 3m each day over the past few weeks, which is one of the fastest vaccination rates in the world, but this has barely made a dent in a country with an estimated adult population of around 900 million people.

It will take months, at least, of consistent vaccination to reach a critical mass of the population. In the short term, the country can only rely on quarantines and social distancing, a strategy that many who rely on daily wages to survive cannot afford.

"We often hear about how the planet is on fire, apparently it's also tilted it's rotation.

The massive melting of glaciers as a result of global heating has caused marked shifts in the Earth’s axis of rotation since the 1990s, research has shown - and scientists say this demonstrates the profound impact we are having on the planet.

If you imagine a metal rod going through the centre of the Earth - around which the planet spins - that is the Earth's axis. It determines what angle the Earth is at. The north and south poles are the point where that that pole enters and exists the globe. But those points are not fixed.

Changes in how the Earth’s mass is distributed around the planet cause the axis, and therefore the poles, to move.

In the past, only natural factors such as ocean currents and the convection of hot rock in the deep Earth contributed to the drifting position of the poles.

But the new research, from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, shows that since the 1990s, the loss of hundreds of billions of tonnes of ice a year into the oceans resulting from the climate crisis has caused the poles to move in new directions.

"Tens of thousands of Russians have rallied in cities across the country in a last-ditch effort to secure the freedom of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

The unsanctioned demonstrations have shown the determination of Navalny’s core supporters, who called for “freedom for political prisoners” in tense standoffs with riot police in helmets and body armour, who had vowed to disperse any gatherings.

"Joe Biden has vowed to cut the US's planet-heating emissions by at least 50% by the end of the decade.

The move comes as America scrambles to regain international credibility after the climate denialist presidency of Donald Trump and in a ramping up of ambition aimed at rallying other countries to do more to confront the climate crisis.

Ahead of a virtual gathering of dozens of world leaders in a climate summit called by Biden, the White House announced that the US will aim to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 50% and 52% by 2030, based on 2005 levels.

The Biden administration has reiterated it wants the US electricity grid to run 100% on clean sources such as solar and wind by 2035 in order to meet its goals and has framed an explosion in renewable energy and electric car production as a boon to American jobs.

Some climate activists have said Biden needs to do even more, however, pointing out that the US is lagging after four years of Trump and the rest of the world has made scant progress to date in cutting emissions, with greenhouse gases already rising again after a dip last year due to pandemic-related shutdowns.

"Hundreds of thousands of predominantly black and Asian troops who died fighting for the British Empire have not been commemorated in the same way as their white comrades due to decisions underpinned by ""pervasive racism"".

The investigation, conducted by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and seen by the Guardian, found that at least 116,000 – but potentially up to 350,000 – predominantly African and Middle Eastern first world war casualties may not be commemorated by name, or at all.

The findings also estimated that between 45,000 and 54,000 African and Asian casualties were commemorated ""unequally"".

The streaming platform has described the show as “a docu-soap series following a ‘feed’ of hot Instagrammers living their best lives, being their best selves, creating the best [drama] content. #nofilter guaranteed.”

But locals have been calling for the show to be cancelled and have held an emergency meeting to discuss what could be done to protect the community.

Delta Kay, an Arakwal Bumberin Bundjalung traditional owner, said: ""We have huge environmental issues, huge social issues here ... I don’t want these influencers coming here and painting this fantasy picture that all is well in Byron Bay. It isn’t.”

Others have raised concerns the show would paper over the housing crisis that the town is now facing - as well as worries the impact that rebranding Byron as a “social media place” could have on local kids.

Netflix’s director of content for Australia and New Zealand said that “the reason behind choosing Byron Bay as a location was driven by the area’s unique attributes as a melting pot of entrepreneurialism, lifestyle and health practices, and the sometimes uneasy coming together of the traditional ‘old Byron’ and the alternative ‘new’, all of which we’ll address in the series.”

All six Premier League clubs who had signed up to the breakaway league have now withdrawn - essentially leaving the project dead in the water following a furious backlash from fans and the UK government.

It comes after the Football Association, the governing body of the game in England, warned that any team involved would be banned from all domestic competitions.

Chelsea led the way amid fan protests outside Stamford Bridge stadium, while Liverpool’s exit came after interventions from two key figures. The captain, Jordan Henderson, said on behalf of the squad: “We don’t like it and we don’t want it to happen. This is our collective position.”

"George Floyd never intended on becoming a wake-up call to America, a rallying cry, or symbol of police brutality. But that was what Derek Chauvin, who has now been found guilty of his murder, did when he knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes on May 25 last year.

According to those that knew him, Floyd wanted to make a mark with his life, especially if it meant using his athletic abilities, through the NFL or NBA. “George turned to me and said, ‘I want to touch the world,’” Jonathan Veal, a teenage friend of Floyd's, told the New York Times.

Before his death Floyd was suffering the same fate as millions of Americans during the coronavirus pandemic: out of work and looking for a new job. He had moved to Minneapolis from his native Houston several years ago in hopes of finding work and starting a new life, said Christopher Harris, his lifelong friend.

“He was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning,” Harris said. “He was happy with the change he was making.”

"Derek Chauvin has been convicted of murder for killing George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes, a crime that prompted a wave of protests in support of racial justice in the US and across the world.

The jury found Chauvin guilty of all charges, after concluding that the white former Minneapolis police officer killed the 46-year-old Black man through a criminal assault by pinning him to the ground so he could not breathe properly. A lack of oxygen in turn caused brain damage, heart failure and death, in May last year.

Chauvin faces up to 40 years in prison, but is likely to receive a shorter sentence according to legal guidelines.

The conviction does not put an end to the highly charged case, which reinvigorated the Black Lives Matter movement, as three other officers face trial later this year accused of aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter.

"New Zealand has announced a series of proposals aimed at outlawing smoking for the next generation and is moving closer to its goal of being smoke-free by 2025.

The plans include the gradual increase of the legal smoking age, which could extend to a ban on the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to anyone born after 2004.

Also under consideration is a significant reduction in the level of nicotine allowed in tobacco products, prohibiting filters, setting a minimum price for tobacco, and restricting the locations where tobacco and cigarettes can be sold.

Smoking accounts for one in four cancer deaths in New Zealand, and around half a million New Zealanders smoke daily. The effects of that are most-felt among Māori, New Zealand’s indigenous people: Māori women have the country’s highest smoking rates, with about 30% smoking daily. Cancer is the leading cause of death for Māori women and the second leading cause for Māori men.

The new approach has been welcomed by a number of public health organisations, but the plans also faced criticism for potential unintended consequences, including the possibility of an expanded black market for tobacco.

The report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, published at the end of March, concluded that while racism and racial injustice still existed, geography, family influence, socioeconomic background, culture and religion all had a greater impact on life chances. The report said it did not find evidence of institutional racism in the areas it examined, such as policing and health.

In a statement, the UN working group of experts on people of African descent said: “In 2021, it is stunning to read a report on race and ethnicity that repackages racist tropes and stereotypes into fact, twisting data and misapplying statistics and studies into conclusory findings and ad hominem attacks on people of African descent.”

The statement went on to say: “This attempt to normalise white supremacy despite considerable research and evidence of institutional racism is an unfortunate sidestepping of the opportunity to acknowledge the atrocities of the past and the contributions of all in order to move forward.”

"Does this paint look extra white to you?

It's the whitest-ever paint and has been produced by academic researchers with the aim of boosting the cooling of buildings and tackling the climate crisis.

It can even give a greater cooling power than common central air conditioners.

The new paint reflects 98% of sunlight as well as radiating infrared heat through the atmosphere into space. In tests, it cooled surfaces by 4.5C below the average air temperature, even in strong sunlight.

Currently available reflective white paints are far better than dark roofing materials, but they can't cool surfaces below the average air temperature like this new paint can.

White-painted roofs have been used to cool buildings for centuries. As global heating pushes temperatures up, the technique is also being used on modern city buildings, such as in Ahmedabad in India and New York City in the US.

Project Drawdown, a charity that assesses climate solutions, estimates that white roofs and green roofs could avoid between 600m and 1.1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, roughly equivalent to two to three years of the UK’s total annual emissions.

It's being billed as the ultimate food fight: Colin the Caterpillar is going to war with lookalike Cuthbert from Aldi supermarket.

With their hard chocolate shells decorated with sweeties and white chocolate grinning faces, it is difficult to tell Colin and Cuthbert apart ... but it's Colin (on the right of the picture above) who's the OG caterpillar cake.

"Just 3% of the planet remains ecologically intact with healthy populations of all its original animals and undisturbed habitat, a new study suggests.

These fragments of wilderness undamaged by human activities are mainly in parts of the Amazon and Congo tropical forests, east Siberian and northern Canadian forests and tundra, and the Sahara.

The new assessment combines maps of human damage to habitat with maps showing where animals have disappeared from their original ranges or are too few in number to maintain a healthy ecosystem.

Invasive alien species including cats, foxes, rabbits, goats and camels have had a major impact on native species in Australia, with the study finding no intact areas left.

The researchers have suggested reintroducing a small number of important species to some damaged areas, such as elephants or wolves – a move that could restore up to 20% of the world’s land to ecological intactness.

Some scientists said the new analysis underestimates the intact areas, because the ranges of animals centuries ago are poorly known and the new maps do not take account of the impacts of the climate crisis, which is changing the ranges of species.

"This remarkable photo shows the biggest rockfall in the UK in 60 years.

Starting on Tuesday, a ""substantial"" section of a cliff on the Jurassic Coast in Dorset collapsed onto a beach below and into the sea.

The rockfall happened just west of the seaside town of Weymouth, and Dorset council said more cliff was expected to be lost, with people being urged to stay away from the area.

About 300 metres of the cliff was affected when 4,000 tonnes came away in massive chunks, some the size of cars, falling towards the beach below.

Student geologist Jodie Brewin told the BBC: “It’s to do with re-weathering and erosion that basically falls hand in hand and shapes this coastline.”

Southern England has seen a lot of rock and cliff falls, and in February, the chalk cliffs that border much of Kent and Sussex experienced a rise in falls. There were warnings the coast could dramatically change by the summer.

"Magic mushrooms show promise in treatment for depression, according to new trials.

The results from a small, phase two clinical trial have revealed that two doses of their active ingredient, psilocybin, appears to be as effective as the common antidepressant escitalopram in treating moderate to severe major depressive disorder, at least when combined with psychological therapy.

“I think it is fair to say that the results signal hope that we may be looking at a promising alternative treatment for depression,” said Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, head of the centre for psychedelic research at Imperial College London and a co-author of the study.

Carhart-Harris said psilocybin was thought to work in a fundamentally different way to escitalopram. While both act on the brain’s serotonin system, he said escitalopram seemed to work by helping people tolerate stress more easily.

However, Carhart-Harris cautioned against seeking out magic mushrooms – a class A drug in the UK – for DIY treatment.

"Denmark has become the first European nation to revoke the residency permits of Syrian refugees, on their insistence that some parts of the country have “improved significantly”, and so are safe to return to.

At least 189 Syrian have had their applications to renew their residency status denied since last year, and currently, around 500 people originally from Damascus and surrounding areas are being re-evaluated.

The issue has attracted widespread attention since 19-year-old Aya Abu-Daher, from Nyborg, pleaded her family’s case on television earlier this month. Holding back tears she asked, what she had “done wrong”.

According to Refugees Welcome Denmark, 30 Syrians have already lost their appeals. However, since Copenhagen does not have diplomatic relations with Damascus, it cannot directly deport people to Syria.

"Russia, Thailand and Venezuela are among the countries that allow men to have rape convictions overturned if they marry the women or girls they have assaulted.

That's according to the UN’s annual state of world population, which has found that 20 countries still allow rapists to marry their victims to escape criminal prosecution.

Dr Natalia Kanem, executive director of the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), which published the report today, said such laws were “a way of subjugating women."" 

Dima Dabbous, whose research is cited in the UNFPA report, said that while is “very difficult to change [these laws] it’s not impossible”. She added that the law in Morocco was repealed following widespread outrage when a young woman killed herself after she was forced to marry her rapist. Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon and Tunisia followed suit.

But in Kuwait, a rapist is still allowed to legally marry his victim with the permission of her guardian. In Russia, if the perpetrator has reached 18 and has committed statutory rape with a minor below 16, he is exempt from punishment if he marries the victim. 

In Thailand, marriage can be considered a settlement for rape if the perpetrator is over 18 and the victim is over 15, if she “consented” to the offence and if the court grants permission for marriage.

The report, which focuses on bodily autonomy – the ability to make choices about your body free from violence or coercion – also highlighted that nearly half of women (45%) in 57 countries are denied the right to say yes or no to sex with their partner, use contraception or seek healthcare.

In Mali, Niger and Senegal, the situation is particularly harrowing. Fewer than one in 10 women make their own decisions about healthcare, contraception and sex with their partners.

"Does this surprise you? The controversial ruler of Dubai is one of the UK's largest landowners, according to a Guardian analysis.

We found that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum and his close family have acquired a land and property empire in Britain that appears to exceed 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres). That area is about half as big as New York City. 

The huge property portfolio ranges from mansions, stables and training gallops across Newmarket, to white stucco houses in some of London’s most exclusive addresses and extensive moorland in the Scottish Highlands.

The Guardian has mapped these expansive private holdings linked to Sheikh Mohammed, who is vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, using Land Registry records and company filings.

The exact scale of his British landholding is not known because most of the properties connected to him are owned via offshore companies in the tax havens of Guernsey and Jersey.

"The actor Hank Azaria has apologised “to every single Indian person” for his portrayal of Apu in The Simpsons.

Azaria, who is white, voiced the role of the Indian American shopkeeper from the show’s inception in 1989 but stood down last year amid criticism of racial stereotyping.

Speaking on the Armchair Expert podcast hosted by the actors Dax Shepard and Monica Padman, Azaria said that though he believed the show was founded on good intentions, it contributed to structural racism in the US.

He added that it had also taken him some time to realize that his portrayal of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon was offensive to the Indian American community.

To Padman, who is Indian American, he said: “I really do apologise. I know you weren’t asking for that but it’s important. I apologise for my part in creating that and participating in that. Part of me feels I need to go round to every single Indian person in this country and personally apologise.”

"What do you think of this?

French MPs have voted to suspend domestic airline flights on routes that can be travelled by direct train in less than two and a half hours, as part of a series of climate and environmental measures.

The ban is a watered-down version of a key recommendation from President Emmanuel Macron’s citizens’ climate convention, which had originally recommended the scrapping of all flights between French destinations where an alternative direct train journey of less than four hours existed.

This was reduced to two and a half hours after strong objections from certain regions and from Air France-KLM, which, like other airlines, has been badly hit by local and international Covid-19 restrictions on travel.

It will mean the end of short internal flights from Orly airport, south of Paris, to Nantes and Bordeaux among others, though connecting flights through Charles de Gaulle/Roissy airport, north of the French capital, will continue.

Details of the exact routes that will be halted will be published in the official decree. Flights from Paris to Nice, which takes about six hours by train, and Toulouse, four hours by train, will continue.

The measure, part of a climate and resilience bill, was passed despite cross-party opposition. The Socialist MP Joël Aviragnet said the measure would have a “disproportionate human cost” and warned of job losses in the airline sector. Other MPs, including from the Green party, complained that watering down the climate convention’s recommendation had made the measure meaningless.",2021-04-12 21:30:30

Young black workers in Britain have been hit disproportionately hard during the pandemic, according to Guardian analysis, with more than 40% unemployed – three times worse than white workers of the same age.

The black youth unemployment rate was the same in the last quarter of 2020 as in the early 1980s, around the time the riots took place.

Before the pandemic, between January and March 2020, 10.6% of young white people were unemployed compared with 25.3% of young black people. Nine months later, the unemployment rate among young black people had shot up by 64.4% compared with 17% for their white counterparts, ONS figures showed.

The data comes less than two weeks after the release of the government’s widely derided race disparity report, which provoked a backlash from critics who accused it of downplaying racism in the UK.

"Born on the island of Corfu, the man who once described himself as 'a discredited Balkan prince of no particular merit or distinction', the Duke of Edinburgh played a key role in the development of the modern monarchy in Britain. 

He lived a life of relentless royal duty, relinquishing his naval career to immerse himself in national life and carving out a unique public role. He could be blunt and outspoken to the point of offensiveness, but he was also charming, engaging and witty.

"Our team in Australia has spent the past three years tracking Indigenous and non-Indigenous deaths in police custody.

The first time we published, in August 2018, an exclusive analysis of 10 years of coronial data found at least 407 Indigenous people had died in police or prison custody since the end of the royal commission in 1991. In 2019, that figure had increased to 424.

Today, it stands at 474.

Aboriginal deaths in custody are a “national shame” not because Aboriginal people die at higher rates in custody than non-Indigenous prisoners, but because Aboriginal people are disproportionately arrested, remanded, and jailed, and so die at higher rates in custody as a proportion of the total population.

"From actors to athletes: these famous people are reclaiming their names.

The director of Thandiwe Newton's earliest film dropped the “w” from her acting credit without proper consultation, using her anglicised “nickname” to differentiate her from the film character bearing her real name. She then became established professionally as “Thandie” for the next three decades.

But now Newton felt it was important to professionally restore her original Zulu name. “That’s my name. It’s always been my name. I’m taking back what’s mine,” she said.

Her stand prompted a conversation about the power of names and has inspired others to reclaim theirs. The actor previously known as Tanya Fear tweeted: “My full name is Tanyaradzwa~ which means ‘we have been comforted’, I was named this because I was born the year my grandfather died.”

In 2017 and 2021 respectively, Taulupe Falatau and Uilisi Halaholo, rugby players of Tongan descent, reclaimed their real names from Toby and Willis - anglicised nicknames they were given.

Reclaiming a name is an act of resistance, the educationalist Pranav Patel has said, adding that schools can play a major role.

“If teachers don’t offer that validation, children feel they have to acquiesce and assimilate to make others comfortable, and that becomes the norm,” he said. “So when you ask someone how to say or spell their name, it has an impact. It says to them: your name matters, you matter. It’s simple.”",2021-04-09 22:00:38
"DMX, the New York rapper whose gruff tone electrified the US music scene in the late 1990s, has died aged 50.

The star, whose real name was Earl Simmons, was hospitalised after a heart attack on 2 April, and had been placed in a critical care unit at White Plains hospital, New York. His family had organised a prayer vigil outside, which took place on Monday.

“Earl was a warrior who fought till the very end,” a statement from his family read. “He loved his family with all of his heart and we cherish the times we spent with him. Earl’s music inspired countless fans across the world and his iconic legacy will live on forever. We appreciate all of the love and support during this incredibly difficult time.”

His label Def Jam Records wrote: “DMX was a brilliant artist and an inspiration to millions around the world. His message of triumph over struggle, his search for the light out of darkness, his pursuit of truth and grace brought us closer to our own humanity. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those who loved him and were touched by him.”

DMX scored five US No 1 albums, featuring hip-hop anthems such as Party Up (Up in Here), What’s My Name? and X Gon’ Give It to Ya.

"Northern Ireland has been rocked by seven successive nights of violence with 55 police officers injured in a level of unrest “not seen in years”.

Cars have been set on fire and petrol bombs and masonry have been thrown at police, leaving 48 officers injured.

Those involved have been small groups of 20, 30 to 40 people, but the sustained nature of the attacks and the seriousness of the violence has shaken many and led to calls for action.

Many have expressed deep concern about the involvement of children, some as young as 12.

Arlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist party leader and first minister, condemned the firebombing of a moving bus and said the latest disturbances were an “embarrassment to society”.

She tweeted: “This is not protest. This is vandalism and attempted murder. These actions do not represent unionism or loyalism.”

Tensions in loyalist communities have been heightened since post-Brexit Irish Sea checks came into force in January, and there is a wider unease in the unionist community that the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, one of four countries in the UK, has been put under threat by the Brexit settlement.

One in three teachers in the UK plan to quit the classroom within five years because of increased workload and decreasing respect for the profession, according to a major union survey.

The poll by the National Education Union (NEU) revealed that out of 10,000 members, 35% said they would “definitely” not be working in education by 2026, while two-thirds (66%) said the status of the profession has got worse and blamed government for failing to listen to or value teachers.

“These findings come after a year in which the education profession – as key workers – have been provided few safety protections, had to improvise solutions where government had simply left a void, and were met with a pay freeze for their troubles,” said Kevin Courtney, NEU joint general secretary.

"What would a tropical reef look like if it could escape the man-made perils of global heating and overfishing?

A new study suggests it would look like Rowley Shoals, an isolated archipelago of reefs 260km off Australia’s north-west coast - seen in the video above.

Fish biologist Matthew Birt led the study on the three reefs that make up the uninhabited Rowley Shoals, using cameras that allowed researchers to analyse the marine life over 14 years.

They found the relative isolation of Rowley Shoals, protections from commercial fishing, and its shape and location has sustained threatened species and rich biodiversity during a time of “unprecedented degradation of coral reefs” elsewhere around the world.

Globally threatened giant fish like the humphead Maori wrasse and humphead parrotfish were seen regularly at Rowley Shoals.

Coral ecologist Dr James Gilmour said Rowley Shoals was now one of Australia’s healthiest reef systems, adding that the high numbers and range of fish made the coral ecosystem more resilient.

According to a new study, one in three people who were severely ill with coronavirus were diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric condition within six months of the infection.

The research used electronic health records of 236,379 patients - mostly from the US - and found 34% experienced mental health and neurological conditions afterwards. The most common being anxiety, with 17% of people developing this.

Experts warned that healthcare systems need to be resourced to deal with patients affected by this, which could be “substantial” given the scale of the pandemic.

The most common diagnoses after Covid were anxiety disorders (occurring in 17% of patients), mood disorders (14%), substance misuse disorders (7%), and insomnia (5%). The incidence of neurological outcomes was lower, including 0.6% for a brain haemorrhage and 0.7% for dementia.

Dr Max Taquet, a co-author of the study from the University of Oxford, said: “We now need to see what happens beyond six months. The study cannot reveal the mechanisms involved, but does point to the need for urgent research to identify these, with a view to preventing or treating them.”",2021-04-07 19:06:46
"Lucy Maino has been stripped of her Miss Papua New Guinea crown after sharing a video of herself twerking on TikTok, with critics saying the incident reveals a deep-seated culture of misogyny in the country.

The 25-year-old, who has also served as co-captain of Papua New Guinea’s women’s football team, faced intense online harassment after posting the video of herself dancing.

Though twerking videos are common on TikTok, Maino’s now-deleted clip was singled out and thousands of people piled on to attack her saying it was not fitting for a “role model” to share a video like this.

After the video and the backlash to it, Maino was “released” from her duties by the Miss Pacific Islands Pageant PNG (MPIP PNG) committee this week. They said: “Our core purpose is empowerment of women.""

Allan Bird, the governor of East Sepik and co-chair of the Coalition of Parliamentarians against Gender-Based Violence, denounced the online harassment of Maino, writing: “What kind of society condemns the torture and killing of women yet get upset when a young woman does a dance video?”

A former Miss PNG, who did not wish to be named, said the incident showed deep-seated misogyny in the country and another women’s advocate, who also wanted to remain anonymous over fears of online abuse, accused the MPIP PNG of throwing Maino ""under the bus"".

Instead it was been rediscovered and posted onto 5TV's YouTube last week, delighting Russian-language fans of JRR Tolkien.

Aired 10 years before the release of the first instalment of Peter Jackson’s movie trilogy, the low-budget film appears ripped from another age: the costumes and sets are rudimentary, the special effects are ludicrous, and many of the scenes look more like a theatre production than a feature-length film.

“Words of condemnation or concern are frankly ringing hollow to the people of Myanmar while the military junta commits mass murder against them,” he said in a statement. “The people of Myanmar need the world’s support. Words are not enough. It is past time for robust, coordinated action.”

The latest chorus of international condemnation came after the defence chiefs of the United States, Britain, Japan and nine other countries denounced the Myanmar military.

“It’s absolutely outrageous and based on the reporting I’ve gotten, an awful lot of people have been killed totally unnecessarily,” the US president Joe Biden told reporters on Sunday.",2021-03-29 15:12:48
"The way traffic is directed in one of Rome's busiest hubs has been given a welcome change, with the introduction of the first female traffic controller in the role.

Cristina Corbucci made her debut on the Piazza Venezia podium this week, after the new commander of Rome's local police decided to break with the all-male tradition.

The platform was first introduced in the late 1920s as a way to make the traffic controllers more visible while directing traffic on what is ordinarily a chaotic square.

Nowadays, the podium rises up and down from the cobblestones at the flick of a switch. But whoever is on duty still has to direct the vehicles coming from three directions around them.

43-year-old Corbucci told local media: “Up there you really feel as if you are in the centre-of-the-centre of Rome. The truly intelligent traffic light is this one.""",2021-03-28 11:00:07

"These young mothers and their children are pinning their hopes on the American dream - after making the long journey from Central America in an attempt to leave lives under a constant threat of violence behind.

Many of the families have spent up to 30 days on the road before passing through the Brownsville immigration depot in Texas.

Nearly all the women tell the same story on arrival. They make the journey north from countries like Guatemala and Honduras, through Mexico, hoping for jobs in the US.

What they are offered in terms of employment is often on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, but better than anything back home, and leaving behind endemic violence.

"In the last 83 days there have been more than 100 mass shootings in the US - this includes the massacres in Atlanta and Boulder over the last week, in which 18 people were killed.

This stat for 2021 comes from the Gun Violence Archive. They define a mass shooting as when four or more people are shot in one incident, not including the shooter.

According to the not-for-profit organisation, there have also been a total of 9,769 people killed by guns in 2021, including suicides, averaging 118 a day.

An alarming number of victims have been young – more than 1,000 children and teenagers have been killed or injured by gunfire since 1 January.

"Chrissy Teigen has said goodbye to her 13.7 million Twitter followers.

The TV personality, cookbook author and former model posted a series of final posts last night acknowledging the abuse and hatred on the platform.

Like most women with a large platform on the site, Teigen, whose funny posts about her family, food and cultural commentary sent her popularity soaring, had received a barrage of threats and harassment in recent years. But starting in late 2017, things got even uglier when Teigan and her husband, singer John Legend, were targeted by conspiracy group, QAnon.

Teigen also faced online harassment after she publicly shared that she had a miscarriage last year – with trolls saying she was using her grief to gain popularity.

Her decision to leave Twitter further highlights the proliferation of unchecked abuse and hate on the social platform. While measures have been rolled out to combat online abuse, such as changing its algorithms and hiding potentially abusive replies, its methods are hardly foolproof and many have been speaking out against what they face on a daily basis.

"From @guardian_us: The numbers are staggering.

Today Democratic senators represent nearly 40 million more voters than Republican senators – but the Senate is split 50-50, with the vice-president, Kamala Harris, wielding the tie-breaking vote.

Critics of the Senate say that for years now, the chamber has not been a field of fair democratic play, paralysed by its own internal rules and insulated from the popular will by a 230-year-old formula for unequal representation.

It currently means that, no matter how popular the bills that Democrats are passing through the House of Representatives may be, they stand almost no chance of becoming law. And this gap between power and representation is only set to get worse.

By 2040, 70% of Americans are expected to live in the 15 largest states, and to be represented by only 30 senators, while 30% of Americans will have 70 senators voting on their behalf, according to analysis by David Birdsell of Baruch College’s School Of Public And International Affairs.

“There’s no doubt that the Senate is broken and has been broken for a long period of time,” said Ira Shapiro, a former Senate staffer, Clinton administration trade official and the author of Broken: Can the Senate Save Itself and the Country?. “It’s been in decline probably for 30 years, and that decline has deepened over the last 12 years.”",2021-03-25 15:14:19

"Members and supporters of the Asian-American community attended rallies of solidarity across the US this weekend.

It comes in the wake of the killing of eight people in shootings in Atlanta, six of whom were women of Asian decent.

Police have been criticised for their response to the shooting, failing to acknowledge the deaths as hate crimes because the shooter had denied anti-Asian racism as a motive.

The killings in Atlanta come in the context of a recent global surge in abuse and assaults, often carried out with direct reference to Covid, since the pandemic began and Donald Trump and others began talking of “the China virus”.

A spate of assaults in the US, in particular on older people, have stirred outrage. Anti-Chinese hate crime rose by a fifth in the UK in the early stages of the outbreak, while nearly one in five Chinese Australians say they have been physically threatened or attacked since it began.

Faradair is working on a short-hop 18-seat plane that will use electric motors to power take-off and landing, the part of any flight with the highest noise and carbon emissions.

Once cruising, at a speed of about 230mph, the plane, known as the Beha,  will switch to its turbogenerator, powered by biofuel, which will also recharge the motors with assistance from solar panels, ready for the aircraft’s descent.

It will be the first aircraft produced since the 1920s to have a three-winged box design. It will be able to convert from passenger to cargo in just 15 minutes because of its palletised interior.

While the creators are hopeful the plane will be carbon neutral eventually, going all electric straight away was not going to be possible, and the Beha will go hybrid to begin with, using sustainable aviation fuels.

"The oil industry knew at least 50 years ago that air pollution from burning fossil fuels posed serious risks to human health, only to spend decades aggressively lobbying against clean air regulations, a trove of internal documents seen by the Guardian reveal.

The documents, which include internal memos and reports, show the industry was long aware that it created large amounts of air pollution, that pollutants could lodge deep in the lungs and be “real villains in health effects”, and even that its own workers may be experiencing birth defects among their children.

But these concerns did little to stop oil and gas companies, and their proxies, spreading doubt about the growing body of science linking the burning of fossil fuels to an array of health problems that kill millions of people around the world each year.

“The response from fossil-fuel interests has been from the same playbook – first they know, then they scheme, then they deny and then they delay,” said Geoffrey Supran, a researcher at Harvard University who has studied the history of fossil-fuel companies and climate change. “They’ve fallen back on delay, subtle forms of propaganda and the undermining of regulation.”

"Scaling walls and scaffolding, ""parkour climate activists"" in Paris are using their skills to turn off store signs with the aim of sending a message about light pollution.

With a strict curfew from 6pm to 6am in place across France, few people can be found walking along the usually bustling Champs-Élysées in the capital. Despite this, many of the stores lining the avenue have continued to keep their illuminated signs and window displays on through the night.

The signs caught the ire of the “On The Spot” collective - eight practitioners of the urban acrobatic sport parkour - and they decided to take things into their own hands, or feet.

“Turning off the lights is a symbolic message about the basic efforts that businesses should be making,” Kevin Ha, a 28-year-old completing his PhD in oceanography and the leader of the group said. “It’s not the efficiency of the operation that matters. Obviously we cannot turn off all the lights in Paris, but we hope to show how even small actions can make a difference.”

Ha emphasised, however, that people should not attempt to climb buildings or walls unless properly trained, saying: “Don’t try this at home kids.”

"If whales are so smart, why’d they hang around to be killed? 

The answer to the age-old question? 
They didn’t ...

That's according to a remarkable new study which has shed light on how whales behaved when attacked by humans in the 19th century.

Using newly digitised logbooks detailing the hunting of sperm whales in the north Pacific, the authors of the paper, published by the Royal Society, discovered that within just a few years, the strike rate of the whalers’ harpoons fell by 58%.

This simple fact leads to an astonishing conclusion: that information about what was happening to them was being collectively shared among the whales, who made vital changes to their behaviour. As their culture made fatal first contact with ours, they learned quickly from their mistakes and abandoned their usual defensive formations, instead swimming upwind to escape.

Sperm whales are highly socialised animals, able to communicate over great distances and also possess the largest brain on the planet.

Scientists say their findings will have implications for the way whales will react to changes wreaked by humans in the 21st century.

"What do you think of these ""skybrators""? 

They are a new bladeless wind turbine that can generate clean energy without the environmental impact of large windfarms - and they have been creating quite a buzz online.

Green energy pioneers, based just outside Madrid, Spain, have drawn up a turbine design that can harness energy from winds without the sweeping white blades considered synonymous with wind power.

It has already raised eyebrows on social media, where the turbine has been likened to a giant vibrating sex toy, or “skybrator”.

The bladeless turbines stand at 3 metres high, a curve-topped cylinder fixed vertically with an elastic rod. To the untrained eye it appears to waggle back and forth, not unlike a car dashboard toy. In reality, it is designed to oscillate within the wind range and generate electricity from the vibration.

The turbines' inventor, David Yáñez, says its unusual technology and design can help fill the gaps where traditional windfarms might not be appropriate - for example in urban and residential areas where the impact of a windfarm would be too great and the space to build one would be too small.

The turbine is no danger to bird migration patterns, or wildlife, particularly if used in urban settings. For the people living or working nearby, the turbine would create noise at a frequency virtually undetectable to humans.

"For the first time since the beginning of England’s national lockdown nearly a year ago, care home residents have finally been allowed to have a family visitor meet them face to face.

On 8 March, when regulations were loosened, photographer @christopherbethell saw his mum sit next to his grandmother's bed to hold her hand and comfort her.

The rules permit only one visitor, so he watched through her window of Green Gables care home - and documented his experience, as well as other families reuniting.

Covid-19 has taken a brutal toll on care homes: in the UK, between mid-March and mid-June 2020 there were 19,286 deaths in which the virus was mentioned on death certificates.

But the effects are not only seen in the statistics. Care home residents have been isolated from the world – the lucky ones live on ground floors where they could have visitors to their windows, but many are secluded a floor or two up.

"Is your fish a fake? 🐟

A Guardian Seascape analysis of 44 recent studies of more than 9,000 seafood samples from restaurants, fishmongers and supermarkets in more than 30 countries found that 36% were mislabelled, exposing seafood fraud on a vast global scale.

Fish fraud has long been a known problem worldwide. Because seafood is among the most internationally traded food commodities, often through complex and opaque supply chains, it is highly vulnerable to mislabelling. 

However, the studies in question sometimes target species known to be problematic, meaning it is inaccurate to conclude that 36% of all global seafood is necessarily mislabelled. 

The studies also use different methodologies and samples. Nor are fish always deliberately mislabelled – although the huge majority of substitutions involved lower-priced fish replacing higher-priced ones, indicating fraud rather than carelessness.

"Deb Haaland has been confirmed as the secretary of the interior, making her the first Indigenous cabinet secretary in US history.

The 60-year-old from New Mexico will be responsible for the country’s land, seas and natural resources, as well as overseeing tribal affairs.

Haaland is a member of the Laguna Pueblo, one of 574 sovereign tribal nations located across 35 states. She is the most senior Indigenous American in the US government since the Republican Charles Curtis, a member of the Kaw nation situated in what is now Kansas, who served as vice-president to Herbert Hoover between 1929 and 1933.

She will lead about 70,000 staff who oversee one-fifth of all the land in the US and 1.7bn acres of coastlines, as well as managing national parks, wildlife refuges and natural resources such as gas, oil and water.

Haaland will also be responsible for upholding the government’s legally binding obligations to the tribes – treaty obligations which have been systematically violated with devastating consequences for life expectancy, exposure to environmental hazards, political participation and economic opportunities in Indian Country.

"Beijing's skies turned an eerie orange as its worst sandstorm in over a decade - combined with already high air pollution - sent readings off the scale.

The tops of towerblocks in the Chinese capital were barely visible, clouded by yellow smog, with commuters using goggles, masks, and hair nets, to protect themselves from the choking air.

When Beijing’s realtime air quality index (AQI) showed a reading of 999, Tokyo recorded 42, Sydney 17 and New York 26. Hong Kong and Taiwan recorded “moderate” readings of 66 and 87, respectively.

State media reported at least 341 people were reported missing in neighbouring Mongolia, which was also hit by sandstorms, and flights were grounded out of Hohhot in inner Mongolia.

Sandstorms are relatively common at this time of year, and usually attributed to winds blowing across the Gobi desert, but long-term residents said they had not seen one of this severity in years.

"This is Brittany Higgins moments before delivering a powerful speech outside Parliament House in Canberra, the building where she says she was raped by a colleague.

The former Liberal party staffer, who spoke out against the government’s response to her allegations, addressed more than a thousand people on Monday at a Women's #March4Justice rally.

She said: “For so long it felt like the people around me did not care about what happened because of what it might mean for them. It was so confusing because these people were my idols. I had dedicated my life to them. Suddenly they treated me differently. I was not a person who had just gone through a lot of changes, I was a political problem"".

Tens of thousands of people attended the #March4Justice rallies across Australia calling for an end to gender-based violence and workplace harassment.

Organisers of the march carried a petition signed by nearly 70,000 people calling for action to better protect women from abuse and harassment.

They wanted to present it to the prime minister but Scott Morrison refused to meet them. He instead offered a meeting in his office, which was refused.

The demonstrations were sparked in part by Higgins’ claims and a now-deceased woman’s allegation that she was raped by attorney general Christian Porter in 1988 - a claim he has strenuously denied.

At every rally, in every city, women carried signs saying: “I believe her”, “I stand with her”. Some also carried signs for Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old woman allegedly murdered in London.

"It began in grief and silence, but ended in anger and violence.

As hundreds gathered in south London to remember Sarah Everard, police were seen dragging mourners from the vigil and trampling flowers and candles laid out in tribute to her. 

Tensions were high before the vigil, which had officially been cancelled after London's police force refused to give the organisers a permit, citing regulations designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. 

That compounded anger at the force, already high after a serving officer was charged with Everard’s kidnap and murder.

The Metropolitan police have defended their policing of the vigil with assistant commissioner, Helen Ball, saying officers were put into a position “where enforcement action was necessary”, because of “the overriding need to protect people’s safety"".

Priti Patel, the home secretary, and the city's mayor, Sadiq Khan, both said they had demanded an explanation, amid accusations that officers had grabbed women during clashes with the crowd and mismanaged the largely peaceful vigil at Clapham Common. 

Everard's disappearance as she walked home on the evening of 3 March has provoked a huge outpouring of grief and dismay in Britain at the failure of police and wider society to tackle violence against women.

Her death sparked months of protests in the city, and her name became a rallying cry at nationwide demonstrations against racial injustice and policing. Numerous high profile figures, including Joe Biden, had called for criminal charges against the police officers who were involved in the raid.

The grand jury did charge one of the officers, Brett Hankison, with three counts of wanton endangerment for firing shots that went into another home with people inside. But jurors didn’t indict any of the officers on charges directly related to Taylor’s death.

"Caroline Flack's mum has accused the media of failing to learn from her daughter's death, saying it must take responsibility for coverage of public figures struggling with mental health problem.

Speaking before the release of a Channel 4 documentary that seeks to present a more nuanced portrait of her “lovely, ordinary” daughter, who took her own life in February last year, Christine Flack said she hoped the outlets that “wrote all the horrible things about Caroline” would “take away that before they print anything, at least find out if it’s true.""

Christine spoke about her own experience with the press after she cleaned her daughter's house following the incident between Caroline and her boyfriend that resulted in her being charged with his assault.

“They followed me and two other 70-year-olds across London one night after I cleaned up the blood in Carrie’s flat, that’s how bad they were,” Christine said. “No, they haven’t changed.”

Despite living in the only state in Germany led by the Green party, some people in Baden-Württemberg believe not enough is being done in responding to the climate emergency.

The political party, called Klimaliste, has policies aimed at ensuring the Paris agreement climate pledges are not breached. It's also a response to the Green party giving more support to the powerful local car industry than to renewable energy.

Two of Klimaliste’s (Climate List) founders were leaders of the student climate strikes sparked by Greta Thunberg in 2019.

"Does this statistic surprise you?

Virtually all young women in the UK have been subjected to sexual harassment, according to a survey from UN Women UK, which warns that most women have lost faith that the abuse will be dealt with.

Among women aged 18-24, 97% said they had been sexually harassed, while 80% of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces.

“This is a human rights crisis. It’s just not enough for us to keep saying ‘this is too difficult a problem for us to solve’ – it needs addressing now,” said Claire Barnett, executive director of UN Women UK.

“We are looking at a situation where younger women are constantly modifying their behaviour in an attempt to avoid being objectified or attacked, and older women are reporting serious concerns about personal safety if they ever leave the house in the dark – even during the daytime in winter.”

The YouGov survey of more than 1,000 women exposes a damning lack of faith in the UK authorities’ desire and ability to deal with sexual harassment – 96% of respondents did not report incidents, with 45% saying it would not change anything.

"Bangladesh’s first transgender news presenter broke down in tears after her word-perfect debut was beamed to the nation and the cameras were off.

Tashnuva Anan Shishir's journey to the newsroom has not been an easy one. She left home after unbearable bullying and her father stopped talking to her for years.

The 29-year-old says she went for auditions with other channels but only Boishakhi was “brave enough to take me in.”

Julfikar Ali Manik, a spokesperson for Boishakhi TV said the channel was determined to give Shishir a chance to shine despite the risk of backlash from some viewers in the conservative country. Her debut marked a “historic step,” he added.

Bangladesh is home to an estimated 1.5 million transgender people, who face rampant discrimination and violence and are often forced to live by begging, the sex trade or crime.

The LGBT community faces widespread discrimination in the south-Asian country, with a colonial-era law still in place punishing gay sex with prison, though enforcement is rare.

Ahead of going live for Monday’s broadcast Shishir revealed that she was terrified, but managed to get the better of her fears; “I don’t want any members of the transgender community to suffer. I don’t want them to live a miserable life. I hope they will find work according to their skills"".

"Apparently it's a good thing to lose your head sometimes - at least if you are a sacoglossan sea slug.

Scientists say that this incredible species can decapitate itself - and then regrow an entirely new body - complete with a beating heart and other vital organs.

The process, from shedding all of itself below the neck to regrowing a new body, took less than a month, in an extreme example of a process known as autotomy.

Reported in the journal Current Biology, Sayaka Mitoh, of Nara Women’s University and colleague Yoichi Yusa wrote how in their studies of the life history of the sea slugs, they spotted something odd.

Three of the younger lab-raised sea slugs, and one wild specimen being reared, “autotomised at their neck position” leaving behind a body with its heart, kidney, intestine and most of the reproductive organs.

While the bodies didn’t survive very long, the decapitated heads started feeding on algae within hours, and healed the “wound” within a day.

The scientists think the sea slugs may have developed the technique as a way of getting rid of a parasite in their body.

Other animals that can regenerate body parts include salamanders that can regrow their full tails, axolotls (colloquially known as Mexican walking fish) that can regrow limbs and some fish that can regrown vital organs.

According to the UN, it's around one billion tonnes annually. That's almost as much as the weight of 150 Pyramids of Giza or 90,000 Eiffel Towers.

The food discarded in homes alone was 74kg per person each year on average around the world, the UN found in the most comprehensive assessment on the issue to date.

The report also includes data on food waste in restaurants and shops, with 17% of all food dumped. Some food is lost on farms and in supply chains as well, meaning that overall a third of food is never eaten.

"Ships suspended in mid-air isn't something you usually spot during a stroll along the English coastline.

But David Morris recently had to do a double take, when he noticed a giant tanker evidently floating above the water as he looked out to sea from a hamlet near Falmouth in Cornwall.

The extraordinary sight, which he captured on camera, is an example of an optical illusion known as a superior mirage.

Such illusions are reasonably common in the Arctic but can also happen in UK winters when the atmospheric conditions are right, though they are very rare.

The effect is caused by a meteorological phenomenon called a temperature inversion, when warm air sits on top of a band of colder air and plays havoc with our visual perception. The inversion in Cornwall was caused by chilly air lying over the relatively cold sea with warmer air above.

David Braine, a BBC meteorologist, explains; “Since cold air is denser than warm air, it bends light towards the eyes of someone standing on the ground or on the coast, changing how a distant object appears.”",2021-03-05 19:00:59

"South Korea’s first transgender soldier, who was forcibly discharged after having gender reassignment surgery, has been found dead.

Byun Hee-soo, 23, enlisted voluntarily in 2017 and went on to have gender confirmation surgery in 2019 in Thailand.

The defence ministry classified her loss of male genitals as a mental or physical handicap, and a military panel ruled in early 2020 that Byun would be compulsorily discharged.

Byun appeared at a press conference at the time to plead to be allowed to serve, wearing her uniform and saluting the gathered journalists and cameras.

“I’m a soldier of the Republic of Korea,” she said, her voice breaking. Serving in the military had always been her childhood dream, she said.

The local mental health care clinic said Byun made an attempt to kill herself three months ago. Police are investigating her death.

South Korea remains deeply conservative about matters of sexual and gender identity and is less tolerant of LGBT+ rights than some other parts of Asia, with many gay and transgender Koreans living largely under the radar.

International rights groups have expressed concern about the way the country treats gay soldiers, who are banned from engaging in same-sex acts and can face up to two years in prison if caught – even though such actions are legal in civilian life.

"SpaceX’s futuristic Starship looked like it aced a touchdown Wednesday, but then exploded on the landing pad with so much force that it was hurled into the air.

The failure occurred just minutes after SpaceX declared success. The landing was at least better than the last two times, where the prototypes crash-landed in fireballs in previous test flights.

The full-scale prototype of Elon Musk’s envisioned Mars ship soared more than six miles after lifting off from the southern tip of Texas on Wednesday. It descended horizontally over the Gulf of Mexico and then flipped upright just in time to land.

The shiny bullet-shaped rocketship remained intact this time at touchdown, prompting the SpaceX commentator John Insprucker to declare, “third time’s a charm as the saying goes” before SpaceX ended its webcast of the test.

But then the Starship exploded and was tossed in the air, before slamming down into the ground in flames.

A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year’s end. Musk has said he intends to fly Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa around the moon with the Starship in 2023.

"Guardian documentary Colette has been shortlisted for an Academy Award following critical acclaim for its emotional impact, including these kind words from British actress Emma Thompson.

The short film is about 90-year-old Colette Marin-Catherine, who confronts her past by visiting the Nazi concentration camp in Germany where her brother was killed. As a young girl, Colette had been a member of the French resistance and had always refused to set foot in Germany. That changes when a young history student named Lucie enters her life and helps her to reopen old wounds and revisit the terrors of that time.

Colette herself has touched many people with her call to young people to make a better future and avoid the mistakes of the past.

"Three Premier League football clubs have altered their badges - removing the animals from their crests for one day - to help highlight the increasing loss of wildlife around the world.

Aston Villa's lion, West Bromwich Albion's throstle and Wolves's wolf were replaced with blank spaces to mark World Wildlife Day, which takes place on 3 March every year.

Championship clubs Coventry, Middlesbrough and Brentford have also taken part - and for the first time in its 60-year history the World Wildlife Fund has too temporarily removed the iconic panda from its logo.

According to WWF's latest Living Planet Report, global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish have suffered an average two-thirds decline in less than half a century.

Aston Villa tweeted: ""A #WorldWithoutNature is a world that is incomplete, just like our badge is today.""

"Self-control ... it's a trait many of us often struggle to exercise. It's linked with higher intelligence - and a new study has now found it is something cuttlefish are also able to exert.

Researchers used an adapted version of the Stanford marshmallow test, in which children were given the choice of scoffing an immediate reward (one marshmallow) or waiting to earn a delayed, but better, reward (two marshmallows) on six cuttlefish in an aquarium environment.

Overtime - and overall - the chunky squid-like creatures delayed gratification when it led to a prey item of higher quality. The eight-armed animals were able to maintain delays for periods of up to 50 seconds to 130 seconds, the authors said.

As well as humans - and now seemingly cuttlefish - chimps, parrots and crows have also evolved to exert self-control.

Previous research had suggested that some primates and birds exhibited this advanced level of self-control because they were social species that maintained multiple relationships and used tools.

Instead, the study's author speculates self-control might have evolved in cuttlefish to maximise efficiency.

"Find it stressful moving house? Try moving it in its entirety – from the floors, windows and walls all the way to the roof. That’s what San Francisco did recently, when the city relocated a Victorian home.

It isn’t the first time San Franciscan drivers have had to give way to oncoming buildings. Photographer @daveglass_foto captured the process in the 70s in a series of black and white images.

"Country music legend @dollyparton has received the Covid-19 vaccine that she helped to fund. Parton broke into song ahead of getting the Moderna jab, adapting one of her best-known songs.

To the tune of Jolene, she sang: 'Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, I’m begging of you, please don’t hesitate. Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, because once you’re dead, then that’s a bit too late.'

"Taylor Swift has criticised the Netflix sitcom Ginny & Georgia for making a “deeply sexist” joke about her dating history.

In a scene where the mother and daughter characters argue about relationship, Ginny tells her mother: “You go through men faster than Taylor Swift.”

Swift’s fans responded angrily and made the hashtag #RESPECTTAYLORSWIFT trend on Twitter over the weekend.

Yesterday, Swift tweeted: ""Hey Ginny & Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back. How about we stop degrading hard working women by defining this horse shit as FuNnY. Also,
Netflix after Miss Americana this outfit doesn’t look cute on you. Happy Women’s History Month I guess.""

Neither Netflix nor the crew of Ginny & Georgia has so far not responded to Swift’s tweet.",2021-03-02 21:00:19
